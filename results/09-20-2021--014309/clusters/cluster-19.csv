"MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions Project Summary The objective of ‘MegaPredict’ is to enable scientists to generate predictions for a natural product (or any molecule) and identify targets for efficacy assessment as well as identify any potential liabilities. We are building on our previous work which has compiled a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and other properties, in a form ready for model building. All of these models utilize the many sources of curated open data, including ChEMBL, ToxCast etc. We have developed a prototype of MegaPredict that utilizes Bayesian algorithm and ECFP6 fingerprints to output a list of prioritized ‘targets’. We realize that neither the algorithm or the descriptors may be optimal therefore we propose to address this as we validate MegaPredict and develop a product over this proposal. Our team is suitably qualified to develop the software needed and we will leverage our large collaborator network to assist us in validating the activity of compounds. We will initially create a script to take a natural product and score it against many thousands of machine learning models then rank the outputs to propose efficacy targets. We will use over 12,000 ChEMBL derived target-assay / bioactivity groups extracted from the ChEMBL v24 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements and other public datasets, using methodology that we have already partially developed. We can repeat this process for over 200 published compounds and access the outputs versus what is known. We intend to compare how the approach performs with synthetic drugs or drug-like compounds as well as natural products. We will assess whether other machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors can improve predictions. As we generate machine learning models such as Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth we will assess the predictions for natural products and compare with the Bayesian approach. We will compare ECFP6 with other 2D, 3D descriptors and physicochemical properties in order to identify the optimal combination for generating predictions for natural products and compare how this differs for synthetic compounds. We will validate our predictions for natural product efficacy assessment. We will work closely with multiple academic groups to generate predictions for at least 20 natural products of interest against over 20 different targets or diseases. Our goal will be to identify potential targets that were previously unknown and then generate in vitro data inhouse or with academic collaborators. Develop a prototype user interface for input of a structure, processing an input molecule and output of prioritized targets and liabilities. We have developed multiple software prototypes (e. Assay Central, MegaTox, etc.) previously and will ensure a user-friendly interface and develop new visualization methods and algorithms for prioritizing potential predicted targets based on the outputs of thousands of machine learning models. In Phase I, we will use the software internally with collaborators to rapidly prototype it. In Phase II we will develop a commercial product, and greatly expand our validation by building a larger network of academic and industry partners that would help to prioritize features of most relevance. Using the machine learning models which we have for natural products is limited because ECFP6 fingerprints cannot distinguish between these very different classes of molecules. But this provides us with an opportunity by going for a ""pharmacophore"" style approach (ideally without using 3D conformations directly). We will therefore focus on developing a ‘3D shape-based fingerprint’ or developing a novel ‘2D fingerprint’ that captures the ‘3D shape’ for natural- and druglike molecules. Currently, the public datasets in ChEMBL and PubChem etc. are made up of mostly druglike molecules, but if we have fingerprints that can compare drug-like and natural product-like molecules then we can likely reliably use our MegaPredict models for natural products as well. We can also attempt to rank natural products with our ChEMBL models or we can look through catalogs of druglike compounds using models derived from natural products. That would be an important innovation. Additionally, in Phase II it would be important to see if we could find uses for natural products with any of the 7000 rare diseases. Developing software that predicts potential natural product drug interactions with various targets could be useful to regulatory organizations as well as the pharmaceutical industry and may broaden utility of being able to more effectively mix natural product and druglike compounds in models will have a profound effect on the value of cheminformatics in this arena. Project Narrative Natural products have long been a source of therapeutics for human healthcare. Yet, some of the challenges with developing natural product treatments are identifying potential human disease related targets and avoiding others that might lead to undesirable natural product-drug interactions. Now there is considerable data in the public domain for millions of molecules with thousands of targets and ADME/T related properties that it is possible to use a suite of machine learning models for prospective prediction and profiling of a molecule’s properties from structure alone. We aim to build on our preliminary efforts to date to create a prototype for MegaPredict using various machine learning models which will enable academic and industrial scientists to generate predictions for a natural product or any molecule of interest and identify potential targets for efficacy and toxicity liability assessment. We will experimentally validate these predictions in-house or through our network of collaborators.",MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions,9846761,R43AT010585,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Fingerprint', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'commercial application', 'deep neural network', 'drug discovery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'novel', 'open data', 'pharmacophore', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'process repeatability', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'software development', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'synthetic drug', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-based tool']",NCCIH,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2019,68862,-0.030838591212446656
"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine. Such automated solutions will leverage emerging computing technologies to determine risk indicators for OA progression in longitudinal cohorts of TMJ health and disease.

"AmplideX DeepNet, a new paradigm for deep learning analytical tools in the molecular diagnostic space Project Summary  An extensible analysis platform will be developed to accurately perform the automated genotyping of PCR/capillary electrophoresis (CE) traces for multiple disease-associated short tandem repeater (STR) assays. This study will evaluate the feasibility of developing generalizable and adaptive molecular analysis models, and will ultimately establish a new paradigm for deep learning analytical tools in the molecular diagnostic space.  Advanced machine learning strategies will be applied to interpret genotypes of inherited disorders caused by genetically unstable STR DNA sequences. STRs have traditionally been difficult to investigate due to their length (on the order of kilobases) and low sequence complexity, which elude detection by traditional and next- generation sequencing technologies. However, advances in PCR/CE technology have enabled the amplification and fragment sizing of STR DNA fragments, advancing clinical research and diagnostic test development for several neurodegenerative disorders, such as fragile X syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Despite these advances, the analysis of PCR/CE data from assays targeting STRs remains a manual, burdensome, and subjective process. There is a clear need to create a system that can scale with the development of new assays, and the proposed approach utilizes modern breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to fulfill that need.  This method will leverage recent advances in representation learning to establish a generalized and adaptive framework for automated PCR/CE annotation that can scale to new assays and improve automatically with the inclusion of new data. The project will benefit from Asuragen’s experience in optimizing repeat-primed chemistries to develop and commercialize multiple high performance assays including the AmplideX PCR/CE FMR1 kit. Importantly, the proposed modeling strategy will borrow-strength across multiple established PCR/CE assays and generalize to future PCR/CE assays for novel STR disease associated biomarkers. This system will be paramount to enabling a continuous learning platform wherein computationally-assisted annotation of PCR/CE assays can be continuously improved and integrated in to clinical research tools and diagnostics. Project Narrative  We are developing AmplideX DeepNet, an artificial intelligence-based analysis system that can accurately perform computationally-assisted analysis of molecular diagnostic assays. The proposed system will build upon recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to allow it to easily adapt to new assays and to continue to improve. The system will be applied to assays for several disorders, including fragile X syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), myotonic dystrophy, and Huntington’s disease, and will provide a number of benefits over current analysis methods by reducing turn-around time for assay results and assuring reproducible reporting between operators and labs.","AmplideX DeepNet, a new paradigm for deep learning analytical tools in the molecular diagnostic space",9678895,R43GM128498,"['Alleles', 'American', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'C9ORF72', 'Capillary Electrophoresis', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'FMR1', 'FMR1 repeat', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Huntington Disease', 'Interruption', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Myotonic Dystrophy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'analysis pipeline', 'analytical tool', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'experience', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'heuristics', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'learning progression', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'research and development', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,"ASURAGEN, INC.",R43,2019,269217,-0.005570027053456657
"Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation Summary/Abstract Alignment of biological sequences is a key step in understanding their evolution, function, and patterns of activity. Here, we describe Machine Learning approaches to improve both accuracy and speed of highly- sensitive sequence alignment. To improve accuracy, we develop methods to reduce erroneous annotation caused by (1) the existence of low complexity and repetitive sequence and (2) the overextension of alignments of true homologs into unrelated sequence. We describe approaches based on both hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks to dramatically reduce these sorts of sequence annotation error. We also address the issue of annotation speed, with development of a custom Deep Learning architecture designed to very quickly filter away large portions of candidate sequence comparisons prior to the relatively-slow sequence-alignment step. The results of these efforts will be incorporated into forks of the open source sequence alignment tools HMMER, MMSeqs, and (where appropriate) BLAST; we will also work with community developers of annotation pipelines, such as RepeatMasker and IMG/M, to incorporate these approaches. The development and incorporation into these widely used bioinformatics tools will lead to widespread impact on sequence annotation efforts. Narrative Modern molecular biology depends on effective methods for creating sequence alignments quickly and accurately. This proposal describes a plan to develop novel Machine Learning approaches that will dramatically increase the speed of highly-sensitive sequence alignment, and will also address two significant sources of erroneous sequence annotation, (i) the presence of repetitive sequence in biological sequences, and (ii) the tendency for sequence alignment algorithms to extend alignments beyond the boundaries of true homology. The proposed methods represent a mix of applications of hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks, and build on prior success in applying such methods to the problem of sensitive sequence annotation.",Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation,9887588,R01GM132600,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Error Sources', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Industry Standard', 'Insertion Mutation', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Biology', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proteins', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Takifugu', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'computing resources', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'markov model', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA,R01,2019,286435,-0.03410429404933184
"MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems Project Summary Computational toxicology aims to use rules, models and algorithms based on prior data for specific endpoints, to enable the prediction of whether a new molecule will possess similar liabilities or not. In some cases, the computational models are derived from discrete molecular endpoints while in others they are quite broad in scope. Considerable progress has been made in computational toxicology in a decade both in model development and availability such that the next generation of larger scale models will promote it to the next level and further focus in vitro and in vivo testing on verification of select predictions. Pharmaceutical, consumer products and other chemistry focused companies possess structure-activity data generated over many decades of screening that is not in the public domain, and this data is primarily only accessible to the cheminformatics experts in each company. Outside of these companies small biotechs and academics must rely on data from public databases, commercial databases and their own data. Integrating such data and processing it to build algorithms that can help with predictive models is a vast undertaking. Our recent efforts have used sources like PubChem and ChEMBL to build predictive models for different toxicity related and drug discovery endpoints. Drug companies tend to focus on target related information whereas there might be an opportunity to understand toxicity also. Our work with a consumer product company indicated the need for accessing machine learning models based on the growing public datasets could be a commercially viable product. Without massive legacy internal data many of small drug discovery and consumer product companies will have to make do with data accessible in PubChem, ChEMBL or other public databases (ToxCast, Tox21 etc) only. In this proposal we will provide toxicity machine learning models developed with different algorithms (Bayesian, Support vector machines, random forest and Deep Neural Networks as just some examples) for 40-50 in vitro and in vivo datasets. We are not aware of any other company pursuing such an approach to create as wide an array of toxicity models. We are also not aware of other software companies in the toxicity model space generating their own experimental data to test the models. Such a technology could have very broad utility for other pharmaceutical companies, biotechs, consumer product companies, regulatory groups and academic research groups. As we have been working for several years to build up technologies and experience in cheminformatics and software development it would be relatively straightforward for us to build the core foundations of MegaTox and deliver them to potential customers. This technology will also be used in our consulting projects with pharmaceutical and consumer product companies. Project Narrative The objective of ‘MegaTox’ is to develop a new computational system and tools for integrating toxicity data, and machine learning models. This will enable the prediction of various toxicity endpoints relevant to pharmaceutical and consumer product companies. We will use the latest machine learning algorithms, access the latest curated public datasets and develop a user intuitive interface and visualization system. We will use MegaTox internally for our own drug discovery projects as well as leverage it for consulting for clients so we can combine public and private datasets and increase the coverage of chemical property space.

"Development of Accurate and Interpretable Machine Learning Algorithms for their application in Medicine Project Summary  The objective of this proposal is to provide a robust course of training for Gilmer Valdes, PhD, DABR, a candidate with an excellent foundation in clinical and machine learning research, to enable him to become an independent investigator. The proposed research aims to address a tradeoff between interpretability and accuracy of modern machine learning algorithms which limits their use in clinical practice. The candidate’s central hypothesis is that the current tradeoff is not a law of nature but rather a limitation of current interpretable machine learning algorithms. Towards proving this hypothesis, the candidate, leading a multidisciplinary team, have developed unique mathematical frameworks (MediBoost and the Conditional Interpretable Super Learner) to build interpretable and accurate models. The proposed research will I) implement and extensively benchmark these frameworks and II) use the algorithms develop to solve three clinical problems where potentially suboptimal models are currently used to make clinical decisions: 1) predicting mortality in the Intensive Care Unit, 2) predicting risk of Hospital Acquired Venous Thromboembolism, 3) predicting which prostate cancer patients benefit the most from adjuvant radiotherapy. The candidate’s training and research plan, multidisciplinary by nature, takes advantage of the proximity of UC San Francisco, Stanford and UC Berkeley and proposes a training plan that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere. Recognizing the multidisciplinary nature of the work proposed, the author will be mentored and work closely with a stellar committee from three institutions and different scientific areas (Machine Learning, Biostatistics, Statistics, Hospital Medicine, Cancer Research and Quality Assurance in Medicine): Jerome H. Friedman PhD (Stanford Statistics Department), Mark Van der Laan PhD (Berkeley Biostatistics and Statistics Department), Mark Segal (UCSF Epidimiology and Biostatistics Deparments), Andrew Auerbach MD (UCSF Medicine Department), Felix Y. Feng MD (UCSF Radiation Oncology),and Timothy D. Solberg PhD (UCSF Radiation Oncology). This committee will be coordinated by Dr Solberg. The candidate also counts with a strong a multidisciplinary team of collaborators. Successful completion of the proposed research will develop the next generation of accurate and interpretable Machine Learning algorithms and solve three important clinical problems where linear models are currently used in clinical settings. This proposal has wide-ranging implications across the healthcare spectrum. The intermediate-term goal is for the candidate to acquire the knowledge, technical skills and expertise necessary to submit a successful R01 proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current state of the art machine learning algorithms have a marked tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. In medicine, where errors can have a dire consequence and knowledge representation and validation is as relevant as accuracy, the development of accurate and interpretable algorithms is of paramount importance.

"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Successful completion of this project will result in novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, predictive models for patient outcomes, and powerful computational frameworks generalizable to critical problems in various diseases.",Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models,9733308,R35GM128638,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2019,388750,-0.02690084959175234
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples and directly translating this ‘omics data into useful biological inference. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples on which we will develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation of free-text sample-level metadata.

"Development of an adaptive machine learning platform for automated analysis of biomarkers in biomedical images ABSTRACT Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists has the potential to introduce bias and error that compromise the reliability of research and clinical findings. These problems are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine, developing effective medical treatments, and promoting confidence in scientific inquiry. Identification of biomarkers and cellular targets following microscopy requires manual analysis of biomedical images, which is time intensive, difficult, and prone to bias and errors. Unintentional bias and attentional limitations during analysis of biomarkers can underlie poor reproducibility of findings in biomedical research and potentially introduce error in clinical diagnostics. We recently developed a “beta” software package designed to improve automation and standardization of image analysis, called “PIPSQUEAK” (Perineuronal net Intensity Program for the Standardization and Quantification of Extracellular matrix Analysis Kit). Since its publication in 2016, PIPSQUEAK beta has amassed approximately 1,300 users worldwide who use it to quantify the intensity and number of perineuronal nets and other neural markers in the brain. This technology significantly increases data reliability between image raters and decreases the time required for analysis by more than 100-fold. However, PIPSQUEAK beta currently uses target detection algorithms that require high-contrast images to automatically identify neurons as clusters of bright pixels on dark backgrounds. A significant current limitation to PIPSQUEAK beta, and other available imaging programs, is that detection of biomarkers can be difficult unless image conditions are ideal. Suboptimal conditions, like high background staining, off-target structures, overlapping or clustered biomarkers, and atypical morphologies, can lead to artifacts and consequently to inaccurate results and erroneous conclusions. Here, we propose to develop a user-friendly artificial intelligence (AI) platform for the automated detection of targeted biomarkers in digital microscopy that reduces this error by learning to distinguish between true cellular biomarkers and artifacts. We propose to integrate AI capabilities into our PIPSQUEAK technology to produce an adaptive, high-throughput, biomedical image analysis platform that quickly and accurately identifies biomarker targets from bench to bedside. A key advantage is that this AI program will be user friendly and available online, making it highly accessible to basic researchers and to technicians and clinicians identifying human pathologies. Thus, successful development of our AI program has a high translational potential. The goal of this proposal is 1) to develop and validate a machine learning model that is capable of detecting common histological marker morphologies in digital microscopy, and 2) to test the feasibility of adapting our AI platform to new biomarker datasets with minimal additional supervised training. Our end goal is to advance the reliability and speed of research findings and clinical diagnoses by making this technology widely available to researchers and clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Manual analysis of biomedical images by researchers and pathologists has the potential to introduces bias and error that compromise the reliability of research and clinical findings; problems which are significant barriers to delivering the most beneficial evidence-based medicine and developing effective medical treatments. Application of artificial intelligence for the detection of disease or cellular targets has the potential to improve the reliability of research findings and clinical diagnoses, while reducing waste, time, and expense.

"QuBBD: Deep Poisson Methods for Biomedical Time-to-Event and Longitude Data  The proposed research directly addresses the mission of NIH's BD2K initiative by developing appropriate tools to derive novel insights from available Big Data and by adapting sophisticated machine learning methodology to a framework familiar to biomedical researchers. This new methodology will be one of the first to enable use of machine learning techniques with time-to-event and continuous longitudinal outcome data, and will be the first such extension of the deep Poisson model. In essence, this undertaking builds the missing bridge between the need for advanced prognostic and predictive techniques among biomedical and clinical researchers and the unrealized potential of deep learning methods in the context of biomedical data collected longitudinally. To facilitate smooth adoption in clinical research, the results will be translated into terms familiar to applied practitioners through publications and well-described software packages. The application of the methodology developed will be illustrated using data from the NIH dbGAP repository, thereby further promoting the use of open access data sources. Optimal risk models are essential to realize the promise of precision medicine.

"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,9664620,R01CA218094,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Fc Receptor', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunize', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Machines', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phage Display', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive test', 'receptor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,573396,-0.019356383562856693

"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current clinical image modalities can be utilized to develop patient-specific computational models to pre-operatively plan transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. However, the computational modeling and simulation processes are time-consuming, which limits clinical translatability. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop algorithms using machine learning techniques to rapidly process and predict TAVR computational simulation outcomes directly from clinical image data.",A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes,9706921,R01HL142036,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Extravasation', 'Feedback', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Valves', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Postoperative Period', 'Problem Sets', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Response Elements', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stents', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'calcification', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'population based', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'speech recognition', 'time resolved data', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual clinical trial']",NHLBI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,381629,-0.018023678130655058
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy,9756832,R01NS111744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Limbic System', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Rattus', 'Records', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Voting', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'animal data', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'human data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,250346,-0.009422728479277947
"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,9636581,R01GM124443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomechanical model', 'community building', 'complex biological systems', 'data access', 'data sharing', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'member', 'new technology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'role model', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,489919,-0.003932148101707224
"Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches Project Summary The form (or shape) and function relationship of anatomical structures is a central theme in biology where abnor- mal shape changes are closely tied to pathological functions. Morphometrics has been an indispensable quan- titative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms for more than 100 years. Recently, the increased availability of high-resolution in-vivo images of anatomy has led to the development of a new generation of morphometric approaches, called statistical shape modeling (SSM), that take advantage of modern computa- tional techniques to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail. SSM stands to revolutionize morphometric analysis, but its widespread adoption is hindered by a number of sig- niﬁcant challenges, including the complexity of the approaches and their increased computational requirements, relative to traditional morphometrics. Arguably, however, the most important roadblock to more widespread adop- tion is the lack of user-friendly and scalable software tools for a variety of anatomical surfaces that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research labs. The goal of this proposal is thus to address these challenges in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM), which automat- ically constructs optimal statistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes without relying on any speciﬁc surface parameterization. The proposed research will provide an automated, general- purpose, and scalable computational solution for constructing shape models of general anatomy. In Aim 1, we will build computational and machine learning algorithms to model anatomies with complex surface topologies (e.g., surface openings and shared boundaries) and highly variable anatomical populations. In Aim 2, we will introduce an end-to-end machine learning approach to extract statistical shape representation directly from im- ages, requiring no parameter tuning, image pre-processing, or user assistance. In Aim 3, we will provide intuitive graphical user interfaces and visualization tools to incorporate user-deﬁned modeling preferences and promote the visual interpretation of shape models. We will also make use of recent advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large cohorts to build and execute custom SSM work- ﬂows using remote scalable computational resources. Algorithmic developments will be thoroughly evaluated and validated using existing, fully funded, large-scale, and constantly growing databases of CT and MRI images lo- cated on-site. Furthermore, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc use cases for complex anatomies to promote reproducibility. Efforts to develop the proposed technology are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), and its third strategic goal: to bridge biology and quantitative science for better global health through supporting the development of and access to computational research tools for biomedical research. Our long-term goal is to increase the clinical utility and widespread adoption of SSM, and the proposed research will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative This project will develop general-purpose, scalable, and open-source statistical shape modeling (SSM) tools, which will present unique capabilities for automated anatomy modeling with less user input. The proposed tech- nology will introduce a number of signiﬁcant improvements to current SSM approaches and tools, including the support for challenging modeling problems, inferring shapes directly from images (and hence bypassing the seg- mentation step), parallel optimizations for speed, and new user interfaces that will be much easier and scalable than the current tools. The proposed technology will constitute an indispensable resource for the biomedical and clinical communities that will enable new avenues for biomedical research and clinical investigations, provide new ways to answer biologically related questions, allow new types of questions to be asked, and open the door for the integration of SSM with clinical care.","Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches",9803774,R01AR076120,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomic Surface', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Bypass', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Felis catus', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematical Computing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Morphogenesis', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Orthopedics', 'Pathologic', 'Population', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'graphical user interface', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'multidisciplinary', 'open source', 'particle', 'preference', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,631809,0.008686287178360655
"POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION Project Summary Malaria that results from Plasmodium falciparum is among the most globally devastating human diseases. The principle vector of malaria, mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex, are thus central targets for controlling the human health burden of Plasmodium. For nearly two decades, there have been large-scale, coordinated efforts to diminish mosquito populations, generally through spraying and insecticide treated bed nets. Indeed such control efforts have now led to a nearly 50% decrease in the rates of malaria infection in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. At present, however, control efforts of A. gambiae are being threatened by evolutionary responses within mosquitos: A. gambiae populations have shown increases in insecticide resistance as well as behavioral adaptations that allow mosquitos to avoid spraying all together. Thus adaptation of mosquitos to the control efforts themselves is currently a risk to maintain the gains made in the fight against malaria. In this proposal we lay out an integrated population genomic approach for systematically identifying regions of the A. gambiae genome that are evolving adaptively in response to ongoing control efforts. Our approach centers upon state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques that we have recently introduced for finding the signatures of selective sweeps in genomes (Schrider and Kern, 2016), coupled with the large-scale population genomic datasets currently in production by the Ag1000G consortium. Project Narrative Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has enormous impacts on human health globally. For the past 16 years, large gains have been made in decreasing the rate of malaria transmission through control of its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae; unfortunately at present these control efforts are in danger of collapse due to the evolution of insecticide resistance in the mosquitos. We aim to discover the genomic targets of such resistance through the development of sophisticated population genomic approaches and their application to state-of- the-art genome sequence datasets from Anopheles gambiae.",POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION,9753261,R01GM117241,"['Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anopheles Genus', 'Anopheles gambiae', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Catalogs', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'Insecticides', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mosquito-borne infectious disease', 'Mutation', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'deep neural network', 'fight against', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'malaria infection', 'malaria mosquito', 'malaria transmission', 'markov model', 'novel', 'recurrent neural network', 'resistance allele', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector mosquito']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2019,295000,-0.023294462967837076
"Reproducible Analytics for Secondary Analyses of ImmPort Vaccination-Related Cytometry Data Project Summary The immunology database and analysis portal (ImmPort, http://immport.niaid.nih.gov) is the NIAID-funded public resource for data archive and dissemination from clinical trials and mechanistic research projects. Among the current 291 studies archived in ImmPort, 114 are focused on vaccine responses (91 for influenza vaccine responses), which is the largest category when organized by research focus. As the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases, development of the next-generation vaccines is faced with the bottleneck that traditional empirical design becomes ineffective to stimulate human protective immunity against HIV, RSV, CMV, and other recent major public health threats. This project will focus on three important aspects of informatics approaches to secondary analysis of ImmPort data for influenza vaccination research: a) expanding the data analytical capabilities of ImmPort and ImmPortGalaxy through adding innovative computational methods for user-friendly unsupervised identification of cell populations, b) processing and analyzing a subset of the existing human influenza vaccination study data in ImmPort to identify cell-based biomarkers using the new computational methods, and c) returning data analysis results with data analytical provenance to ImmPort for dissemination of derived data, software tools, as well as semantic assertions of the identified biomarkers. Each aspect is one specific research aim in the proposed work. The project outcome will not only demonstrate the utility of the ImmPort data archive but also generate a foundation for the Human Vaccine Project (HVP) to establish pilot programs for influenza vaccine research, which currently include Vanderbilt University Medical Center; University of California San Diego (UCSD); Scripps Research Institute; La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology; and J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). Once such computational analytical workflow is established, it can be applied to the secondary analysis of other ImmPort studies as well as to support the user-driven analytics of their own cytometry data. Each of the specific aims contains innovative methods or new applications of the existing methods. The computational method for population identification in Aim 1 is a newly developed constrained data clustering method, which combines advantages of unsupervised and supervised learning. Cutting-edge machine learning approaches including random forest will be used in Aim 2 for the identification of biomarkers across study cohorts, in addition to the traditional statistical hypothesis testing. Standardized knowledge representation to be developed in Aim 3 for cell-based biomarkers is also innovative, as semantic networks with inferring and deriving capabilities can be built based on the machine-readable knowledge assertions. The proposed work, when accomplished, will foster broader collaboration between ImmPort and the existing vaccine research consortia. It will also accelerate the deployment of up-to-date informatics software tools on ImmPortGalaxy. Project Narrative Flow cytometry (FCM) plays important roles in human influenza vaccination studies through interrogating immune cellular functions and quantifying the immune responses in different conditions. This project will extend the current data analytical capabilities of the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) through adding novel data analytical methods and software tools for user-friendly identification of cell populations from FCM data in ImmPort influenza vaccine response studies.

"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia",9731367,R01AG053949,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Bayesian learning', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Harvest', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevention approach', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Saliva', 'Scanning', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'aging brain', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'case control', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk minimization', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'software development', 'sound', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIA,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,410000,-0.081890678665325
"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,9885663,R44DA050155,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Epidemic', 'Government', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New England', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Program Description', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Traction', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual system structure', 'addiction', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'literature citation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid therapy', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'success', 'synthetic opioid', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2019,206139,-0.024268635785638065
"Novel Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes Defined by Functional-Anatomical, Machine-Learned Classifications Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a pervasive disease which affects over 30 million individuals worldwide, in whom it is associated with morbidity and mortality, yet for which therapeutic outcomes are suboptimal. One major limitation to mechanistic and clinical advances in AF is its taxonomy, which is based on number of days of detected AF rather than increasingly reported functional and personalized mechanisms. I reasoned that a digital and scalable AF taxonomy, based on interactions of anatomic and functional factors and clinical features, may better guide existing therapy and catalyze future mechanistic and therapeutic advances. I set out to create a predictive tool to guide therapy in AF patients using machine learning of rich mechanistic data from a large multicenter registry of patients undergoing ablation. I hypothesized that clinically actionable AF phenotypes can be defined by statistical clustering between electrophysiologic features, anatomic regions and clinical indices, that can be uncovered by physiological and statistical quantification and machine learning. I have two Specific Aims: 1) To construct a multimodal digital atlas of atrial fibrillation which registers functional indices at absolute and relative spatial locations in both atria from a multicenter registry, and make this atlas available as an open-source software resource. This deliverable will uniquely map the probability that specific mechanisms will be relevant to AF in a specific patient of given clinical characteristics. Novel pathophysiological phenotypes will be defined via probabilistic interactions in these individual components. 2) To develop a predictive tool using machine learning to estimate the likelihood that ablation at any site(s) will contribute to success tailored to individual characteristics, by learning clusters of electrophysiologic features, clinical indices, and anatomic regions in a training population and applying it to a validation cohort from a large multicenter registry. This project uses state-of-the-art computational tools and statistical methods that may reconcile divergent AF mechanistic hypotheses to define novel functional AF phenotypes and guide therapy. In the process, I will be mentored by world leading mentors, in an extraordinary training environment to facilitate this development into an independent physician-scientist in bioengineering-heart rhythm medicine. Project Narrative This research provides an avenue to define atrial fibrillation in an actionable classification rooted in pathophysiologic and mechanistic observations. Such a classification scheme would further our understanding and refine our conversation about complex arrhythmia in cardiac tissue. Only an understanding at this level is will provide truly effective and safe treatments of each individual patient’s arrhythmic condition.","Novel Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes Defined by Functional-Anatomical, Machine-Learned Classifications",9772892,F32HL144101,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atlases', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Atrium', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy trial', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'health care service utilization', 'heart rhythm', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient registry', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'predictive tools', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'trial design']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,66778,-0.0140539271420104
"Multiscale ab initio QM/MM and machine learning methods for accelerated free energy simulations Q-Chem is a state-of-the-art commercial computational quantum chemistry program that has aided about 60,000 users in their modeling of molecular processes in a wide range of disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and materials science. In this proposal, we seek to significantly reduce the computational time (now around 500,000 CPU hours) required to obtain accurate free energy profiles of enzymatic reactions. Specifically, we propose to use a multiple time step (MTS) simulation method, where a low-level (and less accurate) quantum chemistry method is used to propagate the system (i.e. move all atoms) at each time step (usually 0.5 or 1 fs), and then a high-level (i.e. more accurate and expensive) quantum chemistry method is used to correct the force on the atoms at longer time intervals. In this way, the simulation can be performed at the high-level energy surface in a fraction of time, compared with simulations performed only using the high-level quantum chemical method. In the Phase I proposal, our goal is to allow the high-level force update only once every 40—50 fs by identifying appropriate lower-level theories (Aim 1) and incorporating machine-learning techniques (Aim 2). This will accelerate accurate free energy simulations by 20—25 fold, reducing the overall computer time to around 25,000 CPU hours. Thus, our new MTS simulation method will make it feasible to routinely perform computational studies on enzymatic reaction mechanism. The addition of these new tools will also further strengthen Q-Chem's position as a global leader in the molecular modeling software market, making our program the most efficient and reliable computational quantum chemistry package for simulating large, complex chemical/biological systems. In this project, we seek to significantly reduce the computational time (ca. 500,000 CPU hours) required to obtain accurate free energy profiles of enzymatic reactions to ca. 25,000 CPU Hours.

"PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository The confluence of new machine learning (ML) data-driven approaches; increased computational power; and access to the wealth of electronic health records (EHRs) and other emergent types of data (e.g., omics, imaging, mHealth) are accelerating the development of biomedical predictive models. Such models range from traditional statistical approaches (e.g., regression) through to more advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks, CNNs), and span different tasks (e.g., biomarker/pathway discovery, diagnostic, prognostic). Two issues have become evident: 1) as there are no comprehensive standards to support the dissemination of these models, scientific reproducibility is problematic, given challenges in interpretation and implementation; and 2) as new models are put forth, methods to assess differences in performance, as well as insights into external validity (i.e., transportability), are necessary. Tools moving beyond the sharing of data and model “executables” are needed, capturing the (meta)data necessary to fully reproduce a model and its evaluation. The objective of this R01 is the development of an informatics standard supporting the requisite information for scientific reproducibility for statistical and ML-based biomedical predictive models; from this foundation, we then develop new computational approaches to compare models' performance. We begin by extending the current Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard to fully characterize biomedical datasets and harmonize variable definitions; to elucidate the algorithms involved in model creation (e.g., data preprocessing, parameter estimation); and to explain the validation methodology. Importantly, models in this PMML format will become findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (i.e., following FAIR principles). We then propose novel meth- ods to compare and contrast predictive models, assessing transportability across datasets. While metrics exist for comparing models (e.g., c-statistics, calibration), often the required case-level information is not available to calculate these measures. We thus introduce an approach to simulate cases based on a model's reported da- taset statistics, enabling such calculations. Different levels of transportability are then assigned to the metrics, determining the extent to which a selected model is applicable to a given population/cohort (i.e., helping answer the question, can I use this published model with my own data?). We tie these efforts together in our proposed framework, the PREdictive Model Index & Exchange REpository (PREMIERE). We will develop an online portal and repository for model sharing around PREMIERE, and our efforts will include fostering a community of users to guide its development through workshops, model-thons, and other activities. To demonstrate these efforts, we will bootstrap PREMIERE with predictive models from a targeted domain (risk assessment in imaging-based lung cancer screening). Our efforts to evaluate these developments will engage a range of stakeholders (model developers, users) to inform the completeness of our standard; and biostatisticians and clinical experts to guide assessment of model transportability. PROGRAM NARRATIVE With growing access to information contained in the electronic health record and other data sources, the appli- cation of statistical and machine learning methods are generating more biomedical predictive models. However, there are significant challenges to reproducing these models for purposes of comparison and application in new environments/populations.

"Common Fund Data Supplement: Integration of KOMP2 (IMPC) and PHAROS into MARRVEL 2.0 for machine learning-assisted rare variant prioritization Project Summary  This application is being submitted in response to NOT-RM-19-009 as a supplement to the parent award U54NS093793.  The Common Fund supports a number of resources that can significantly enhance gene and variant prioritization for study in the Model Organisms Screening Center of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network and beyond. To facilitate the use of these resources, we propose to create a tool that can be easily accessed by clinical geneticists and model organism scientists alike.  MARRVEL (Model organism Aggregated Resources for Rare Variant ExpLoration) was created two years ago because important data that is necessary for rare variant analysis for personalized medicine is spread throughout the internet in tens of different locations. To improve efficiency and streamline access to these data sources, we created a web-tool that allows users to query tens of data sources at once, including GTEx, and links to IMPC, the display portal for KOMP2.  In this proposal, our goal is to develop version 2 of MARRVEL to promote the use of Common Fund resources in the rare disease research community for manual and automated data analysis. This goal will be accomplished by developing MARRVEL 2.0 by integrating KOMP2 (IMPC) and PHAROS data and using the aggregated dataset to develop a machine-assisted gene and variant prioritization for diagnosis and animal model generation.  Our goals align with those of the NIH Common Fund to increase the utility of resources for broader use in the biomedical community. Project Narrative  We aim to promote the use of Common Fund resources and facilitate the diagnosis of rare diseases and the subsequent generation of animal models for the Undiagnosed Diseases Network and beyond.

"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning,9714883,R01EB027895,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Alkynes', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Azides', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophage T4', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Capsid', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Magnetism', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'arm', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'rapid detection', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIBIB,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,666637,-0.0186559127544688
"Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer Abstract FreeSurfer is a tool for the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that has proven to be a flexible and powerful technology for quantifying the effects of many conditions, including numerous neurological disorders, on human brain anatomy, connectivity, vasculature, chemical composition, physiology and function. In the past 20 years, these open source tools have been developed to accurately and automatically segment an array of brain structures. In this project, we seek the resources to radically increase the speed, accuracy and flexibility of these tools, taking advantage of exciting new results in Deep Learning. This will enable us to more accurately quantify neuroanatomical changes that are critical to diagnosing, staging and assessing the efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions in diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. This includes the generation of documentation, tutorials, unit tests, regression tests and system tests to harden the tools and make them usable by clinicians and neuroscientists, and finally the distribution and support of the data, manual labelings and tools to the more than 35,000 researchers that use FreeSurfer through our existing open source mechanism. Relevance Successful completion of the proposed project will increase the usability and accuracy of our publicly available segmentation tools, and open up new possibilities, such as integrating them into the MRI scanner. These new capabilities well enable other studies to significantly increase their ability to detect disease effects in research settings as well as phase II and phase III clinical trials due to the radical increase in speed of the new tools, enabling them to be applied to a diverse set of MRI contrasts and much larger datasets, rapidly and accurately.",Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer,9971629,R56AG064027,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Label', 'Licensing', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'improved', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'skills', 'spatial relationship', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability', 'web site', 'wiki']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R56,2019,609504,-0.016111741142374694
"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,9802783,R01NS112497,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Meningoencephalitis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neocortex', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'computational intelligence', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2019,488027,-0.020669059160438687
"Image-guided robot for high-throughput microinjection of Drosophila embryos PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is submitted in response to the NIH Development of Animal Models and Related Biological Materials for Research (R21) program. The proposal develops an image-guided robotic platform that performs the automated delivery of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded reagents such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes to monitor cellular processes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session. The proposed work builds on recent engineering innovations in our collaborative group which has developed image-guided robotic systems that can precisely interface with single cells in intact tissue. The two Specific Aims provide for a systematic development of the proposed technologies. AIM 1 first engineers a robotic platform (‘Autoinjector’) that can scan and image Drosophila embryos in arrays of egg laying plates. We will utilize machine learning algorithms for automated detection of embryos, followed by thresholding and morphology analysis to detect embryo centroids and annotate injection sites. In AIM 2, we will utilize microprocessor-controlled fluidic circuits for programmatic delivery of femtoliter to nanoliter volumes of reagents into individual embryos. We will quantify the efficacy of the Autoinjector by comparing the survival, fertility, and transformation rates of transposon or PhiC31-mediated transgenesis to manual microinjection datasets. Finally, we will demonstrate the efficient delivery of sgRNAs and mutagenesis in the presence of Cas9. This project fits very well within the goals of the program by engineering a novel tool for producing and improving animal models. The Autoinjector will accelerate Drosophila research and empower scientists to perform novel experiments and genome-scale functional genomics screens that are currently too inefficient or labor intensive to be conducted on a large scale and may additionally enable other novel future applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal develops a technology platform that will enable automated microinjection of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded tools such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles, into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session.

"Advancing Human Health by Lowering Barriers to Electrophysiology in Genetic Model Organisms Project Summary The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has proven valuable as a model for many high-impact medical conditions. The strength of C. elegans derives from the extensive homologies between human and nematode genes (60-80%) and the many powerful tools available to manipulate genes in C. elegans, including expressing human genes. Researchers utilizing medical models based on C. elegans have converged on two main quantifiable measures of health and disease: locomotion and feeding; the latter is the focus of this proposal. C. elegans feeds on bacteria ingested through the pharynx, a rhythmic muscular pump in the worm’s throat. Alterations in pharyngeal activity are a sensitive indicator of dysfunction in muscles and neurons, as well as the animal’s overall health and metabolic state. C. elegans neurobiologists have long recognized the utility of the elec- tropharyngeogram (EPG), a non-invasive, whole-body electrical recording analogous to an electrocardiogram (ECG), which provides a quantitative readout of feeding. However, technical barriers associated with whole- animal electrophysiology have limited its adoption to fewer than fifteen laboratories world-wide. NemaMetrix Inc. surmounted these barriers by developing a turn-key, microfluidic system for EPG acquisition and analysis called the the ScreenChip platform. The proposed research and commercialization activities significantly expand the capabilities of the ScreenChip platform in two key respects. First, they enlarge the phenotyping capabilities of the platform by incorporating high-speed video of whole animal and pharyngeal movements. Second they develop a cloud database compatible with Gene Ontology, Open Biomedical Ontologies and Worm Ontology standards, allowing data-mining of combined electrophysiological, imaging and other data modalities. The machine-readable database will be compatible with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. It will be accessible to all researchers to enable discovery of relationships between genotypes, phenotypes and treatments using large-scale analysis of multidimensional phenotypic profiles. The research and commercialization efforts culminate in an unprecedented integration of genetic, cellular, and organismal levels of analysis, with minimal training and effort required by users.

"Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research Project Summary Deep learning methods are showing great promise for advancing cancer research and could potentially improve clinical decision making in cancers such as primary brain glioma, where deep learning models have recently shown promising results in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and survival in these patients. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Although our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, there are three key challenges to translating these methods into research practice: (1) data is heterogeneous among institutions in the amount and quality of data that could impair the distributed computations, (2) there are data security and privacy concerns, and (3) there are no software packages that implement distributed deep learning with medical images. We tackle these challenges by (1) optimizing and expanding our current methods of distributed deep learning to tackle challenges of data variability and data privacy/security, (2) creating a freely available software system for building deep learning models on multi- institutional data using distributed computation, and (3) evaluating our system to tackle deep learning problems in example use cases of classification and clinical prediction in primary brain cancer. Our approach is innovative in developing distributed deep learning methods that will address variations in data among different institutions, that protect patient privacy during distributed computations, and that enable sites to discover pertinent datasets and participate in creating deep learning models. Our work will be significant and impactful by overcoming critical hurdles that researchers face in tapping into multi-institutional patient data to create deep learning models on large collections of image data that are more representative of disease than data acquired from a single institution, while avoiding the hurdles to inter-institutional sharing of patient data. Ultimately, our methods will enable researchers to collaboratively develop more generalizable deep learning applications to advance cancer care by unlocking access to and leveraging huge amounts of multi-institutional image data. Although our clinical use case in developing this technology is primary brain cancer, our methods will generalize to all cancers, as well as to other types of data besides images for use in creating deep learning models, and will ultimately lead to robust deep learning applications that are expected to improve clinical care and outcomes in many types of cancer. Project Narrative We develop technology that will enable researchers to tap into the enormous amount of imaging data in multiple institutions to create deep learning models for cancer applications without requiring sharing of patient data. Our work will thus enable development of more robust deep learning models to improve clinical decision making in cancer than models currently built on data from single institutions. Although our focus is improving decision making in the primary brain cancer, our methods and tools are generalizable and will be broadly applicable to all cancers, with the potential for improvement in clinical care and patient health.",Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research,9827476,U01CA242879,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Brain', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Glioma', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Information Networks', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'molecular marker', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient privacy', 'radiologist', 'research to practice', 'software systems', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,401628,-0.04194975499094433
"Development of label-free computational flow cytometry for high-throughput micro-organism classification The purpose of flow cytometers is to enable the classification of cells or organisms at high throughput. Label-free optical flow cytometers not based on fluorescence are generally based on scattering. The most common of these compares the amount of forward (FS) versus side (SS) scattering. Such two-parameter information permits rudimentary classification based on size or granularity, but it misses more subtle features that can be critical in defining organism identity. Nevertheless, FS/SS flow cytometry remains popular, largely because of its simplicity and capacity for high throughput.  We propose to develop a label-free computational flow cytometer that preserves much of the simplicity and high-throughput capacity of FS/SS flow cytometry, but provides significantly enhanced information. Instead of characterizing organisms based on scattering direction (as does FS/SS flow cytometry), we will characterize based on scattering patterns. We will insert a reconfigurable diffractive element in the imaging optics of a flow cytometer to route user-defined basis patterns to independent detectors. The basis patterns will be optimally matched to specific sample features. The respective weights of these basis patterns will serve as signatures to identify organisms of interest. The basis patterns themselves will be determined by machine learning algorithms. Both the device and the learning algorithms will be developed from scratch.  We anticipate that our flow cytometer will be able to operate at flow rates on the order of meters per second, commensurate with state-of-the-art FS/SS flow cytometers, while providing significantly more information for improved classification capacity.

"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems. The project describes a new mathematical data analysis approach, rooted on transport and related phenomena, which is aimed at greatly enhance our ability to extract meaning from diverse biomedical datasets, while augmenting the accuracy of predictions.",Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science,9642618,R01GM130825,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cartilage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'absorption', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'brain morphology', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'electric impedance', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'gray matter', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical theory', 'microscopic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'neural network', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2019,375602,-0.00861942770125119
"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources. A) Machine learning models will be created that automatically assign probability estimates to three types of observational studies that are widely examined by systematic reviewers. B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics. A) Methods will be developed for ranking articles with respect to their relevance to a proposed new systematic review topic. B) A scoping tool will be created that displays articles ranked by predicted relevance, tagged with study design attributes, sample sizes, and Cochrane risk of bias estimates. The proposed studies will advance the automation of early steps in the process of writing systematic reviews, and thereby enhance evidence-based medicine and the incorporation of best practices into clinical care. Project Narrative Systematic reviews are essential for determining which treatments and interventions are safe and effective.

"Automatic analysis of 3D skin images for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) severity assessment Project Summary More than 20,000 hematopoietic stem cell transplants (including bone marrow transplants) are performed in the U.S. each year to cure a range of diseases ranging from leukemias to sickle cell anemia to autoimmune deficiencies in children. Unfortunately, most long-term non-relapse survivors will die of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), which remains a disease of steadily increasing incidence and profound unmet need. A fundamental barrier in cGVHD management and research is a lack of sensitive and objective assessment tools that permit objective and reproducible measures of disease severity and progression. Skin is the most commonly affected organ in cGVHD and automated techniques capable of measuring precisely the surface area of involved skin in photographs may provide the tools necessary for effectively evaluating patient progress. We propose to (1) create the data set necessary to develop machine learning-based methods for the automatic analysis of cGVHD images, and (2) implement and evaluate these methods. Project Narrative  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a lethal disease that affects most long-term hematopoietic stem cell transplant (including bone marrow transplants) recipients. Skin images are used to assess disease severity and progression but the technology required to quantitatively and reproducibly analyze these images is lacking.

"Neuroinformatics platform using machine learning and content-based image retrieval for neuroscience image data This project aims to develop NeuroManager™, an innovative neuroinformatics platform for advanced parsing, storing, aggregating, analyzing and sharing of complex neuroscience image data. A core technology that we will develop in NeuroManager will be Image Content Analysis for Retrieval Using Semantics (ICARUS), a novel, intelligent neuroimage curation system that will enable image retrieval based on visual appearance or by semantic concept. ICARUS will use machine learning applied to content-based image retrieval - (CBIR) to build and refine models that summarize microscopic and macroscopic image appearance and automatically assign semantic concepts to neuroimages. Neuroscience research generates extensive, multifaceted data that is considerably under-utilized because access to original raw data is typically maintained by the source lab. On the other hand, there are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results. Unfortunately, none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists. To solve this problem, NeuroManager will include the following distinct, significant innovations: (i) versatility for handling two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional neuroimaging data sets from animal models and humans; (ii) functionality to share complex datasets that extends secure, privacy-controlled paradigms from institutional, laboratory-based and even public domains; (iii) flexibility to implement NeuroManager within an institute’s IT infrastructure, or on most cloud-based virtualized environments including Azure, Google Cloud Services and Amazon Web Services; (iv) and most importantly, the ICARUS technology for CBIR in neuroimaging data sets. The benefit of NeuroManager for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be to foster collaboration between scientists and institutions, promoting innovation through combined expertise in an interdisciplinary atmosphere. This will open new horizons for better understanding the neuropathology associated with several human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions at various levels (i.e., macroscopically, microscopically, subcellularly and functionally), ultimately leading to an improved basis for developing novel treatment and prevention strategies for complex brain diseases. In Phase I we will prove feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype software that will perform CBIR on 2D whole slide images of coronal sections of entire mouse brains from ongoing research projects of our collaborators. Work in Phase II will focus on developing the commercial software product that will include all of the innovations mentioned above. A competing technology with comparable functionality, addressing the full breadth of needs for modern neuroscience research, is currently not available commercially or otherwise. There are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results; however none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists.

"Leveraging Twitter to monitor nicotine and tobacco-related cancer communication Patterns in Twitter data have revolutionized understanding of public health events such as influenza outbreaks. While researchers have begun to examine messaging related to substance use on Twitter, this project will strengthen the use of Twitter as an infoveillance tool to more rigorously examine nicotine, tobacco, and cancer- related communication. Twitter is particularly suited to this work because its users are commonly adolescents, young adults, and racial and ethnic minorities, all of whom are at increased risk for nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) use and related health consequences. Additionally, due to the openness of the platform, searches are replicable and transparent, enabling large-scale systematic research. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team of experts in diverse relevant fields—including public health, behavioral science, computational linguistics, computer science, biomedical informatics, and information privacy and security—will build upon our previous research to develop and validate structured algorithms providing automated surveillance of Twitter’s multifaceted and continuously evolving information related to NTPs. First, we will qualitatively assess a stratified random sample of relevant NTP-related tweets for specific coded variables, such as the message’s primary sentiment and other key information of potential value (e.g., whether a message involves buying/selling, policy/law, and cancer-related communication). Tweets will be obtained directly from Twitter using software we developed that leverages a comprehensive list of Twitter-optimized search strings related to NTPs. Second, we will statistically determine what message characteristics (e.g., the presence of certain words, punctuation, and/or structures) are most strongly associated with each of the coded variables for each search string. Using this information, we will create specialized Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically assess and categorize future Twitter data. Third, we will use this information to provide automatic assessment of current and future streaming data. Time series analyses using seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) will determine if there are significant changes over time in volume of messaging related to each specific coded variables of interest. Trends will be examined at the daily, weekly, and monthly level, because each of these levels is potentially valuable for intervention. To maximize the translational value of this project, we will partner with public health department stakeholders who are experts in streamlining dissemination of actionable trends data. In summary, this project will substantially advance our understanding of representations of NTPs on social media—as well as our ability to conduct automated surveillance and analysis of this content. This project will result in important and concrete deliverables, including open-source algorithms for future researchers and processes to quickly disseminate actionable data for tailoring community- level interventions. For this project, we gathered a team of public health researchers and computer scientists to leverage the power of Twitter as a novel surveillance tool to better understand communication about nicotine and tobacco products (NTPs) and related messages about cancer and cancer prevention. We will gather a random sample of Twitter messages (“tweets”) related to NTPs and examine them in depth and use this information to create specialized computer algorithms that can automatically categorize future Twitter data. Then, we will examine changes over time related to attitudes towards and interest in NTPs, as well as cancer-related discussion around various NTPs, which will dramatically improve our ability to better understand Twitter as a tool for this type of surveillance.",Leveraging Twitter to monitor nicotine and tobacco-related cancer communication,9656981,R01CA225773,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'County', 'Data', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Food', 'Football game', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Laws', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Opinion', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Tobacco-Related Carcinoma', 'Twitter', 'Work', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer prevention', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'ethnic minority population', 'geographic difference', 'hookah', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'prospective', 'racial minority', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'statistics', 'time use', 'tobacco products', 'tool', 'trend', 'vaping', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,431185,-0.035437555232182845
"Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository Three-dimensional anatomic modeling and simulation (3D M&S) in cardiovascular (CV) disease have become a crucial component of treatment planning, medical device design, diagnosis, and FDA approval. Comprehensive, curated 3-D M&S databases are critical to enable grand challenges, and to advance model reduction, shape analysis, and deep learning for clinical application. However, large-scale open data curation involving 3-D M&S present unique challenges; simulations are data intensive, physics-based models are increasingly complex and highly resolved, heterogeneous solvers and data formats are employed by the community, and simulations require significant high-performance computing resources. Manually curating a large open-data repository, while ensuring the contents are verified and credible, is therefore intractable. We aim to overcome these challenges by developing broadly applicable automated curation data science to ensure model credibility and accuracy in 3-D M&S, leveraging our team’s expertise in CV simulation, uncertainty quantification, imaging science, and our existing open data and open source projects. Our team has extensive experience developing and curating open data and software resources. In 2013, we launched the Vascular Model Repository (VMR), providing 120 publicly-available datasets, including medical image data, anatomic vascular models, and blood flow simulation results, spanning numerous vascular anatomies and diseases. The VMR is compatible with SimVascular, the only fully open source platform providing state-of-the-art image-based blood flow modeling and analysis capability to the CV simulation community. We propose that novel curation science will enable the VMR to rapidly intake new data while automatically assessing model credibility, creating a unique resource to foster rigor and reproducibility in the CV disease community with broad application in 3D M&S. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims: 1) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of anatomic patient-specific models built from medical image data, 2) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of 3D blood flow simulation results, 3) Disseminate the data curation suite and expanded VMR. The proposed research is significant and innovative because it will 1) enable rapid expansion of the repository by limiting curator intervention during data intake, leveraging compatibility with SimVascular, 2) increase model credibility in the CV simulation community, 3) apply novel supervised and unsupervised approaches to evaluate anatomic model fidelity, 4) leverage reduced order models for rapid assessment of complex 3D data. This project assembles a unique team of experts in cardiovascular simulation, the developers of SimVascular and creator of the VMR, a professional software engineer, and radiology technologists. We will build upon our successful track record of launching and supporting open source and open data resources to ensure success. Data curation science for 3D M&S will have direct and broad impacts in other physiologic systems and to ultimately impact clinical care in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular anatomic models and blood flow simulations are increasingly used for personalized surgical planning, medical device design, and the FDA approval process. We propose to develop automated data curation science to rapidly assess credibility of anatomic models and 3D simulation data, which present unique challenges for large-scale data curation. Leveraging our open source SimVascular project, the proposed project will enable rapid expansion of the existing Vascular Model Repository while ensuring model credibility and reproducibility to foster innovation in clinical and basic science cardiovascular research.",Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository,9859232,R01LM013120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Basic Science', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Engineering', 'Source Code', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'computing resources', 'data format', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gigabyte', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'online repository', 'open data', 'open source', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'stem', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'supervised learning', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'unsupervised learning', 'web portal']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,345016,0.005610297748064459
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. Real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a field with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact public health. The goal of the proposed research is to develop statistical modeling frameworks for making forecasts of infectious diseases in real-time and integrating these forecasts into public health decision making.",Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches,9773141,R35GM119582,"['Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modernization', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training', 'analytical method', 'global health', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid growth', 'vector control']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R35,2019,360843,-0.031360582395361214
"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9750722,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Disease model', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,527585,-0.027923046680459595
"Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop open-source software and algorithms for 3-D reconstruc- tion and multi-scale mapping of normal tissues. Another significant goal is to evaluate effects of aging and envi- ronmental factors on molecular and structural architecture of skin. We will leverage our mature (TRL8) technol- ogy for multiplexed 2-D imaging (Cell DIVE™), and our vast experience in 2-D image analytics and machine learning. We have selected normal skin as the organ to develop these tools for several reasons, a) clinical sam- ples from different age groups are more readily available, b) it is a good model to independently capture changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) due to age and normal exposure to environmental factors as well as a variety of pathogenic insults. While the ECM, cellular and intracellular molecular composition varies considerably among various organs, we believe many of the tools developed under this program will be applicable to reconstruct and map other organ models at high (cellular/subcellular) resolution. This proposal will focus on developing algo- rithms and a framework for multi-scale mapping of 3-D tissue images, which will address HuBMAP priorities around quantitative 3-D image analysis/mapping, including automated 3-D image segmentation, feature ex- traction, and image annotation. High-resolution (subcellular) mapping of biomolecules will be implemented us- ing 2-D multiplexed images that are used to reconstruct the 3-D tissue and linked to a lower resolution 3-D opti- cal coherence tomography (OCT) image of the normal tissue. Other cell-level omic data (e.g., RNA FISH) will be mapped in the same way. The low-resolution image is mapped back to a higher-level landmark (e.g., organ) as defined by the HuBMAP common coordinate framework (CCF). As outlined, our proposed technologies will in- clude several key features that are significant and complimentary to existing HuBMAP consortium projects and will advance the state of the art in 3-D tissue analysis. The proposed algorithms will have several key innova- tions that will advance the state of the art in 3-D multiplexed tissue image analysis. First, given the large vol- umes to be analyzed, high throughput will be a key requirement of each image analysis algorithm. This will be supported by our extensive experience in parallelizing single cell analysis pipelines. Second, the proposed algo- rithms will segment the images at multiple scales. The third area of innovation will focus on efficient multi- channel analysis. The proposed project will include creation of an easy-to-use software tool for assembling and visualizing multiscale tissue data called Tissue Atlas Navigation Graphical Overview (TANGO). PROJECT NARRATIVE Composition and organization of cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) they are embedded in, controls the function of different organs in human body. Alterations in any of these can lead to onset and progression of var- ious diseases. The proposed project will develop image analytics algorithms and open source software for high- resolution 3-D mapping of skin, the largest organ in the human body, and evaluate molecular and architectural changes due to aging and UV exposure.",Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues,9893208,UH3CA246594,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'California', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multiomic Data', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Organ Model', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Aging', 'Skin Tissue', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age group', 'analysis pipeline', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'high dimensionality', 'image visualization', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging platform', 'innovation', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'multiplexed\xa0imaging', 'open source', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sample collection', 'single cell analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'tomography', 'tool']",NCI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,UH3,2019,587413,-0.028474558735905955
"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease. The imaging informatics platform described in this application will enable biomedical researchers to capture, analyze, and share imaging and related data.

"Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics Microbial population genetic research has been crucial for understanding pathogen dynamics, virulence, host specificity, and many other topics; in many cases uncovering unexpected and transformative biological processes. However, conventional population genetic analyses are limited by the quantity of sequence data from each sample. The temporal, spatial, and evolutionary resolution of techniques that rely on single gene sequences or multi-locus sequence typing are often insufficient to study biological processes on fine scales, precisely the scales at which many evolutionary and mechanistic process occur. Population genomics offers a vast quantity of sequence information for inferring evolutionary and ecological processes on very fine spatial and temporal scales, inferences that are critical to understanding and eventually controlling many infectious diseases. The promise of population genomics is tempered, however, by difficulties in isolating and preparing microbes for next-generation sequencing. We have developed the selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) technology to sequence microbial genomes from complex biological specimens without relying on labor-intensive laboratory culture, even if the focal microbial genome constitutes only a miniscule fraction of the natural sample. The primary hindrance to popular adoption of SWGA for microbial genomic studies is not its effectiveness in producing samples suitable for next-generation sequencing but in the upfront investment needed to develop an effective protocol to amplify the genome of a specific microbial species. Identifying an SWGA protocol that consistently results in selective and even amplification across the target genome is currently hindered by computationally-inefficient software that can evaluate a very limited set of the potentially effective solutions. Further, this software uses marginally-effective optimality criteria as there is currently only a limited understanding of the true criteria that result in highly-selective and even amplification of a target genome. As a result, SWGA protocol development is currently costly in both time and resources. A primary goal of the proposed research is to identify the criteria that result in optimal SWGA by analyzing next- generation sequencing data with advanced machine learning techniques. These optimality criteria will be integrated into a freely-available, computationally-efficient swga development program that will reduce the upfront investment in SWGA protocol development, thus allowing researchers to address medically- and biologically-important questions in any microbial species. In the near term, this project will also generate effective SWGA protocols for four microbial species which can be used immediately to address fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, disease progression, and emerging infectious disease dynamics. From a global disease perspective, this work is imperative as the majority of microbial species cannot easily be cultured and are in danger of becoming bystanders in the genomics revolution that is currently elucidating evolutionary processes and molecular mechanisms in cultivable microbial species. Addressing many of the major outstanding questions about pathogen evolution will require analyses of populations of microbial genomes. Although population genomic studies would provide the analytical resolution to investigate evolutionary and mechanistic processes on fine spatial and temporal scales – precisely the scales at which these processes occur – microbial population genomic research is currently hindered by the practicalities of obtaining sufficient quantities of genomes to analyze. We propose to develop an innovative, cost-effective, practical, and publically-available technology to collect sufficient quantities of microbial genomic DNA necessary for next-generation microbial genome sequencing.",Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics,9699440,R21AI137433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratory culture', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genome Sequencing', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protocol development', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,186101,-0.035346536146348875
"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE Mapping effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing of different types of individual cells, understanding the func- tion and relationships between those cell types, and modeling their individual and collective function. In order to exploit human and machine intelligence, different visual interfaces will be implemented that use the CCF in support of data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, mathematical biology, and biomedical data standards to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimen- sional spatial basemap of the human body and associated data overlays that can be interactively explored online as an atlas of tissue maps. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across the human body along multiple functional contexts (e.g., systems physiology, vascular, or endocrine systems), and connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources as driven by the context or “position” on the map. The CCF and the interactive data visualizations will be multi-level and multi-scale sup- porting the exploration and communication of tissue and publication data--from single cell to whole body. In the first year, the proposed Mapping Component will run user needs analyses, compile an initial CCF using pre-existing classifications and ontologies; implement two interactive data visualizations; and evaluate the usa- bility and effectiveness of the CCF and associated visualizations in formal user studies. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an ex- tensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spa- tial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical. This project will work in close coordination with the HuBMAP consortium to help drive an ecosystem of useful resources for understanding and leveraging high- resolution human image data and to compile a human body atlas.","The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets",9988039,OT2OD026671,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Biometry', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Endocrine system', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Participant', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Services', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Vascular System', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'hackathon', 'human imaging', 'interoperability', 'member', 'systematic review', 'usability', 'vector']",OD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,OT2,2019,49496,-0.03181111993284603
"Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding Project Summary/Abstract Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are poised to transform toxicological evaluation, however new approaches to enable their functional and structural profiling are needed to improve the utility of hiPSC -based models for predictive and mechanistic toxicology screening. This need is addressed by our project’s Specific Aims that encompass (1) development of a novel platform for generation of hiPSC-derived reporter cells; (2) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; and (3) implementation and validation of a pilot machine learning-enabled predictive cardiotoxicity screen using these tools. The proposed tools are configured to be extensible to other toxicology- relevant pathways and phenotypes making it uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing commercial need for high-throughput predictive toxicology assays. The project deliverables benefit public health by improving the ability to rapidly identify liabilities in specific cardiomyocyte lineage types, thus reducing the time and cost to pinpoint cardiotoxicity of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. Project Narrative The assay and reagents established in the course of this project directly address the goals of significant initiatives to improve the effectiveness of cardiotoxicity testing, such as the FDA’s CiPA initiative and the work of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. The resulting improvements in the pace and precision of drug testing will result in public health benefit through the development of more cost-effective and safer medicines. Beyond toxicological evaluation of therapeutic compounds, our innovative technology will deliver additional benefit to public health by virtue of its utility in investigating the toxicities of environmental chemicals, in line with the focus of government agencies and initiatives such as the EPA and Tox21 in the US and EU-ToxRisk in Europe.",Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding,9761607,R44TR002572,"['Address', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug toxicity', 'Effectiveness', 'Europe', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health Benefit', 'Heart Atrium', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry Standard', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mitochondria', 'Nodal', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sarcomeres', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'base', 'cell immortalization', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical predictors', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'environmental chemical', 'expression vector', 'genome editing', 'high throughput screening', 'immortalized cell', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phase I trial', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'response', 'safety assessment', 'screening', 'site-specific integration', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NCATS,"CAIRN BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2019,821559,-0.023472441844949378
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers.

"Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia PROJECT SUMMARY  Abnormalities of white matter are important in schizophrenia. A preponderance of studies have found decreased levels of transcripts for myelin-related proteins in autopsy brains. Some have found decrease in the proteins themselves, and some have not. Hundreds of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have found reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the brains of many people with schizophrenia (SCH). Decreased FA is interpreted as disruption of normal architecture. However, postmortem examination has failed to identify characteristic abnormalities. This suggests that abnormalities are subtle, and perhaps postmortem examinations have not used the right tools to find them. We have therefore been developing, as part of a collaboration supported by our concluding Fogarty project, two new methods to characterize white matter at high resolution. The first is a machine learning protocol to measure axonal diameters and myelin sheath thickness in electron microscope (EM) images of prefrontal white matter, recognizing and avoiding artifacts in EM of autopsy tissue. This will enable us to measure thousands of fibers in EM images produced as part of our concluding Fogarty project, from individuals with SCH, major depressive disorder (MDD), or no psychiatric illness (NPI). The second method, suggested by the DTI findings, is to analyze the arrangement of the axons themselves. We will use 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of high-resolution images of the axons themselves, identified by Bielschowsky silver stain or immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated neurofilament protein. To obtain high-resolution images of Bielschowsy stains, we will take advantage of the recent observation by Dr. Mark Sonders, co-investigator on this project, that these and other heavy metal stains luminesce under 2-photon infrared excitation. This yields clear and measurable images of individual axons. We will perform these procedures on sections from existing paraffin blocks that comprise a complete left prefrontal coronal section from 36 triads containing 1 case each of SCH, MDD, or NPI, matched for sex and age. These brains were included in earlier studies that yielded data on protein composition, mRNA for myelin-related proteins, DNA methylation, microglial activation, and semiquantitative myelin histology. In a third, exploratory aim, we will employ graphical models to combine these various types of data with known properties of CNS white matter and myelin to build a model of what is disturbed in schizophrenia. We expect that novel techniques for data fusion will reveal associations based on multidimensional correlations that could not be detected by modeling the single-domain datasets separately. In the process of completing these scientific aims, we will pursue the pedagogic goals of training the first two professional biostatisticians in Macedonia, and an academic pathologist. We will also hold a seminar course for biological researchers to build awareness and understanding of the power of biostatistical and other computational methods to enrich their research. NARRATIVE Our ongoing Fogarty/NIMH research project in Macedonia (R01 MH060877, “Building Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia”), has demonstrated biochemical abnormalities of white matter in schizophrenia that are not present in major depressive disorder. However, we have not seen anatomical abnormalities of white matter, which MRI studies of schizophrenia tell us should exist, and as the biochemistry also suggests. To explore white matter in novel ways, we are developing new methods of microscopy, image analysis and statistical inference, which we now propose to employ on a large scale.",Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research in Macedonia,9953486,R56MH117769,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academy', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Awareness', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electrons', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Macedonia', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myelin', 'Myelin Sheath', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurofilament Proteins', 'Paraffin', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Silver Staining', 'Stains', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translational Research', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'deep neural network', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'high resolution imaging', 'histological image', 'histological studies', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pedagogy', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy', 'two-photon', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R56,2019,10000,-0.035753228203446626
"Intelligent deployment of containerized bioinformatics workflows on the cloud PROJECT SUMMARY Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges of big data.

"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design Our Vision: We propose DeepLink, a versatile data translator that integrate multi-scale, heterogeneous, and multi-source biomedical and clinical data. The primary goal of DeepLink is to enable meaningful bidirectional translation between clinical and molecular science by closing the interoperability gap between models and knowledge at different scales. The translator will enhance clinical science with molecular insights from basic and translational research (e.g. genetic variants, protein interactions, pathway functions, and cellular organization), and enable the molecular sciences by connecting biological discoveries with their pathophysiological consequences (e.g. diseases, signs and symptoms, pharmacological effects, physiological systems). Fundamental differences in the language and semantics used to describe the models and knowledge between the clinical and molecular domains results in an interoperability gap. DeepLink will systematically and comprehensively close this gap. We will begin with the latest technology in semantic knowledge graphs to support an extensible architecture for dynamic data federation and knowledge harmonization. We will design a system for multi-scale model integration that is ontology-based and will combine model execution with prior, curated biomedical knowledge. Our design strategy will be iterative and participatory and anchored by 10 major milestones. In a series of demonstrations of DeepLink’s functions, we will address one of the major challenges facing translational science: reproducibility of biomedical research findings that are based on evolving molecular datasets. Reproducibility of analyses and replication of results are central to scientific advancement. Many landmark studies have used data that are constantly being updated, curated, and pared down over time. Our series of demonstrations projects are designed to prototype the technology required for a scalable and robust translator as well as the techniques we will use to close the interoperability gap for a specific use case. The demonstration project will, itself, will be a significant and novel contribution to science. DeepLink will be able to answer questions that are currently enigmatic. Examples include: - From clinicians: What is the comparative effectiveness of all the treatments for disease Y given a patient's genetic/metabolic/proteomic profile? What are the functional variants in cell type X that are associated with differential treatment outcomes? What metabolite perturbations in cell type Y are associated with different subtypes of disease X? - From basic science researchers: What is known about disease Y across all model organisms (even those not designed to model Y)? What are all the clinical phenotypes that result from a change in function in protein X? Which biological pathways are affected by a pathogenic variant of disease Y? What patient data are available to evaluate a molecularlyderived clinical hypothesis? Challenges and Our Approaches: DeepLink will close the interoperability gap that currently prohibits molecular discoveries from leading to clinical innovations. DeepLink will be technologically driven, addressing the challenges associated with large, heterogeneous, semantically ambiguous, continuously changing, partially overlapping, and contextually dependent data by using (1) scalable, distributed, and versioned graph stores; (2) semantic technologies such as ontologies and Linked Data; (3) network analysis quality control methods; (4) machine-learning focused data fusion methods; (5) context-aware text mining, entity recognition and relation extraction; (6) multi-scale knowledge discovery using patient and molecular data; and (7) presentation of actionable knowledge to clinicians and basic scientists via user-friendly interfaces. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9855180,OT3TR002027,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'molecular domain', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'prototype', 'text searching', 'user-friendly']",NCATS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,OT3,2019,702655,-0.024540363529119095
"Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium Project Summary/Abstract The Arkansas Research Alliance proposes to hold five annual workshops on the subject of bioinformatics. The purpose is to bring six major Arkansas institutions into closer collaboration. Those institutions are: University of Arkansas-Fayetteville; Arkansas State University; University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas at Little Rock; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff; and the National Center for Toxicological Research. The workshops will focus on capabilities at each of the six in sciences related to bioinformatics including artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, food and agriculture, high speed computing, and visualization capabilities. As this work progresses, educational coordination and student encouragement will be important components. Principals from all six institutions are collaborating to accomplish the workshop goals. Project Narrative The FDA ability to protect the public health is directly related to its ability to access and utilize the latest scientific data. Increased proficiency in collecting, presenting, validating, understanding, and drawing quantitative inference from the massive volume of new scientific results is necessary for success in that effort. The complexity involved requires continued development of new tools available and being developed within the realm of information technology, and the workshops proposed here will address this need. Specific Aims  • Thoroughly understand the resources in Arkansas available for furthering the capabilities in  bioinformatics and its associated needs, e.g., access to high speed computing capability and use  of computational tools. • Develop a set of plans to harness and grow those capabilities, especially those that are relevant  to the needs of NCTR and FDA. • Stimulate interest and capability across Arkansas in bioinformatics to produce a larger cadre of  expertise as these plans are implemented. • Enlist NCTR’s help in directing the effort toward seeking local, national and international data  that can be more effectively analyzed to produce results needed by FDA and others, e.g.,  reviewing decades of genomic/treatment data on myeloma patients at the University of  Arkansas for Medical Sciences. • Develop ways in which the Arkansas capabilities can be combined into a coordinated, synergistic  force larger than the sum of its parts. • Encourage students and faculty in the development of new models and techniques to be used in  bioinformatics and related fields. • Improve inter-institutional communication, including developing standardized bioinformatics  curricula and more universal course acceptance.",Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium,9911854,R13FD006690,[' '],FDA,ARKANSAS RESEARCH ALLIANCE,R13,2019,15000,-0.027101482806880656
"Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections Abstract COMBiNATi will work with Stanford University to bring the world’s first integrated ID+AST UTI diagnostic platform to the market by combining COMBiNATi’s “one-click” cost-effective dPCR platform with Stanford’s pathogen identification (ID) HRMA algorithm for broad detection, deep characterization and absolute quantification of UTI pathogens. By the end of the Phase 1 project, we will deliver the prototype instrument for ID and AST, scale-ready consumables for dPCR + HRM and culture + qPCR, machine-learning software algorithm for melt curve analysis, and prove the feasibility by identifying and quantifying the top two urinary tract infection bacteria. We will first develop two consumables: an 100k partition ID chip and a 32-lane, 10k partition per lane AST plate based on the micro-injection molding design rules established by COMBiNATi. An integrated system with thermal control and imaging capability will then be developed for HRM and qPCR processes. The prototype system will then be transferred to Stanford University where mock samples including both isolated bacteria and contrived urine samples will be tested on the platform for integrated pathogen ID and AST determination. Narrative Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common community-acquired bacterial infection. However, like other bacterial infections, standard culture-based diagnosis of UTI requires at least 2-3 days from sample acquisition to result reporting. Despite technological advancements, the process remains time- consuming and requires significant technical expertise. Automated instruments remain bulky and still require clonal isolation of the pathogens from the body fluid samples prior to AST. Additionally, the lack of definitive microbiological diagnosis that is rapid enough to achieve evidence-based treatment has driven the over- and misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We believe the proposed integrated ID + AST platform has the potential to enable deep genetic analyses of clinical samples to provide rapid precision UTI triage and MIC determination in a timely and cost-efficient manner to positively impact patient care as well as promote the use of narrow spectrum antibiotics to favorably impact antibiotic resistance profiles.",Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections,9777415,R41AI145604,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Ampicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Fluids', 'Ceftriaxone', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gentamicins', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microfluidics', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Molecular', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Uropathogen', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'digital', 'genetic analysis', 'imaging capabilities', 'instrument', 'melting', 'microbial', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'prototype', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'success']",NIAID,"COMBINATI, INC.",R41,2019,224658,-0.01586944426483926
"Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instrumentation have not been fully leveraged to upgrade the information content of metabolomics datasets obtained from stable isotope labeling studies. This is primarily due to lack of validated software tools for extracting and interpreting isotope enrichments from HRMS datasets. The overall objective of the current application is to develop tools that enable the metabolomics community to fully leverage stable isotopes to profile metabolic network dynamics. Two new tools will be implemented within the open-source OpenMS software library, which provides an infrastructure for rapid development and dissemination of mass spectrometry software. The first tool will automate tasks required for extracting isotope enrichment information from HRMS datasets, and the second tool will use this information to group ion peaks into interaction networks based on similar patterns of isotope labeling. The tools will be validated using in-house datasets derived from metabolic flux studies of animal and plant systems, as well as through feedback from the metabolomics community. The rationale for the research is that the software tools will enable metabolomics investigators to address important questions about pathway dynamics and regulation that cannot be answered without the use of stable isotopes. The first aim is to develop a software tool to automate data extraction and quantification of isotopologue distributions from HRMS datasets. The software will provide several key features not included in currently available metabolomics software: i) a graphical, interactive user interface that is appropriate for non-expert users, ii) support for native instrument file formats, iii) support for samples that are labeled with multiple stable isotopes, iv) support for tandem mass spectra, and v) support for multi-group or time-series comparisons. The second aim is to develop a companion software that applies machine learning and correlation-based algorithms to group unknown metabolites into modules and pathways based on similarities in isotope labeling. The third aim is to validate the tools through comparative analysis of stable isotope labeling in test standards and samples from animal and plant tissues, including time-series and dual-tracer experiments. A variety of collaborators and professional working groups will be engaged to test and validate the software, and the tools will be refined based on their feedback. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it will provide the advanced software capabilities required for both targeted and untargeted analysis of isotopically labeled metabolites, but in a flexible and user-friendly environment. The research is significant because it will contribute software tools that automate and standardize the data processing steps required to extract and utilize isotope enrichment information from large-scale metabolomics datasets. This work will have an important positive impact on the ability of metabolomics investigators to leverage information from stable isotopes to identify unknown metabolic interactions and quantify flux within metabolic networks. In addition, it will enable entirely new approaches to study metabolic dynamics within biological systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop novel software tools to quantify and interpret data from stable isotope labeling experiments, which can be used to uncover relationships between metabolites and biochemical pathways. These tools have potential to accelerate progress toward identifying the causes and cures of many important diseases that impact metabolism.",Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets,9786702,U01CA235508,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Infrastructure', 'Ions', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'stable isotope', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'working group']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,431816,-0.007051846526749243
"Conference on Modern Challenges in Imaging in the Footsteps of Allan Cormack Project Summary: Tufts University physics professor Allan Cormack pioneered the field of tomography. His seminal work, from 1963 and 1964, provided both the mathematical foundations of computerized tomography (CT), and tangible proof-of-concept by engineering a rudimentary CT scanner. Taken together, this effort represented the first practical method to ""see into"" an object without physically breaking it open. Along with the engineer Godfrey Hounsfield, he won the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for these contributions. Since then, tomography has broadened to include a wide range of modalities and problems. This field is unique for the rich interplay among applications in medicine, security, earth sciences, industry, physics, and the mathematics required to solve these problems. This international conference at Tufts, “Modern Challenges in Imaging: In the Footsteps of Allan Cormack” will honor the achievements of Cormack and reflect this diversity in the field by gathering top international researchers in mathematics, engineering, science, and medicine to communicate the most current research and challenges in the field. This will include work on mathematical models of emerging modalities, tomographic machine learning, dynamic methods, and spectral imaging with applications include medicine and security. The best research from the conference will be disseminated in a special issue of the journal Inverse Problems. Talks will be posted on the conference website. The organizers will recruit a diverse set of experienced participants and trainees, and the conference will be advertised in a range of publications reflecting the scientific and demographic diversity of the field. This conference is unique in that it combines high-level mathematical participants with experts in medical and industrial CT. It is structured to encourage participants from different fields to talk with each other, broaden their horizons, and make connections between problems and methodologies in the various fields. Several of the plenary talks will provide introductions to the areas. Trainees will be integrated into the conference through an informal welcome lunch and a poster session to introduce them to researchers in the field. This supports goals 1, 4, and 5, of the NIBIB: Researchers will present innovative biomedical technologies, engineering solutions, and mathematical methods to better image the body and objects more generally. The synergy between research areas will support the translation of technologies from the academic sphere to medical utility. The training opportunities for graduate students and beginners support the training of the next generation of diverse scientists.

"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals). Project Narrative Biological assays are the foundation for developing drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolu- tionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that assays are written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized descriptions readable by computers. This lack of machine-readable annotations is a major impediment to manage, find, compare, re-use, and learn from the millions of assays. This project will develop a formal process and integrated tools to support the complete cycle of tasks and decisions required for bioassay annotation, enabling expedited (and more cost-effective) drug discovery.","Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols",9747967,U01LM012630,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'FAIR principles', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Hour', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polishes', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Readability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Update', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'informatics training', 'novel', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2019,514129,-0.02417392246166815
"Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award. Narrative We will refine the operations of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford in coordination with other Phase II sites of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network to diagnose the undiagnosed and facilitate a transition to sustainability. Our Center will bring Stanford’s long history in technology development, genomic data analysis, stem cell biology, and translational science to the team-based diagnosis and care of patients with undiagnosed disease. We will refine existing procedures to further optimize the diagnostic process and integrate care of the undiagnosed into clinical practice while preserving the scientific mission of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network.",Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford,9789914,U01HG010218,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Award', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Child Health', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Education', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Silencing', 'Generations', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Organoids', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policy Maker', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'operation', 'outreach', 'patient outreach', 'phenotypic data', 'preservation', 'programs', 'reference genome', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'socioeconomics', 'stem cell biology', 'success', 'support network', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virtual']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,1500000,-0.017559687873418585
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9663961,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,127308,-0.013114022665932352
"An automated pipeline for macromolecular structure discovery in cellular  electron cryo-tomography SUMMARY – OVERALL Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function. Although the basic electron cryo-tomography technique has been used for several decades, the technology is being revolutionized by recent advances in sample preparation, electron cryo-microscopy hardware, improved capabilities for automatic data collection, direct electron detection imaging devices, and phase plate technologies. Combined, these advances led to the ability to generate extraordinarily large numbers of cellular cryo-tomograms of exquisite quality. In principle, such large data sets offer insights into cellular variation in disease states as well as better insights into basic cellular function, opening new possibilities for studying the underpinnings of health and disease at the finest possible level, potentially leading to completely new diagnostics for cancer and other cell-altering diseases. However, collection of cellular data is now at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed with existing methods, producing a serious barrier to progress: to match the data production rates of a single laboratory, at least 50 experienced scientists would need to handle the data analysis. The primary goal of this Program Project is to establish quantitative and highly automated tools for the reconstruction and interpretation of highly complex cellular tomographic data. We have assembled a highly synergistic team of PIs with complimentary expertise in cutting-edge computational and experimental electron microscopy techniques to achieve this goal through collaborative efforts. Project 1 (Hanein & Penczek) focuses on development and implementation of tomogram quality assessment and validation techniques and on experimentally guided optimization of data collection strategies. Project 2 focuses on automatic tomographic reconstruction technology, extraction of various features from the tomograms, and the analysis of distribution patterns derived from the extracted features. Project 3 focuses on development of quantitative tools for tomogram annotation through deep learning and sub-tomogram alignment as well as interactive visualization tools. The set of highly automated tools developed in this Program Project will permit us to interpret 5–10x as much data as is possible using existing methods, greatly expanding the types of cellular variations we can effectively study. NARRATIVE Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function and—with recent instrumental advances—it is now possible to image hundreds of cells per months, enabling collection of cellular data at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed.

"Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn Abstract Worldwide, infectious disease remains the leading cause of neonatal mortality and results in one million newborn deaths each year. Rapid and precise profiling of pathogens is the key to targeted and effective clinical management of infectious disease. However, current diagnostic methods are slow, limited in breadth of detection, and often unreliable. Further, they have limited ability to detect polymicrobial infection and suffer from poor specificity due to an inability to distinguish clinically relevant from non-pathogenic DNA. Genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (HRM) provides a simple, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. HRM generates sequence specific melt curves in a closed-tube reaction as PCR-amplified DNA fragments are heated and disassociate. Our team has advanced this technology through the proof-of-concept stage, demonstrating that a novel digital PCR format for HRM can achieve accurate universal genotyping and quantification of DNA targets in under 3 hours. DNA sequences present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified using the principles of microfluidic sample partitioning and machine learning to enable sensitive specific polymicrobial detection of all the targets present in the DNA mixture. However, for clinical integration, critical innovations are needed. This includes optimization of our upstream processing steps to selectively capture, load, and detect DNA sequences from only viable pathogen cells from a small-volume (≤ 1mL) neonatal blood sample. Further, methods to establish linkages between pathogen identity and antibiotic resistance are needed at the single cell level to fully characterize and accurately quantitate the resistance profile of the pathogen population for precise targeted treatment. In phase I of this proposal, we will focus on refining sample preparation steps to (1) maximize our sensitivity and (2) enable co-localization of resistance markers with identified microbes. We hypothesize that we can efficiently capture pathogen load from blood, reducing interference from human cell contents and enable single cell analysis and quantitation of only viable pathogens while linking species identification and resistance. The processes and tests developed in this proposal will provide: 1) high negative predictive value to rule out bloodstream infection; and 2) specific identification and quantitation of pathogens along with co-localization of relevant antibiotic resistance genes for the targeted treatment of true infections while limiting influence from contaminants or environmental microbes of no clinical significance. In Phase II, the system will be developed to its beta form for testing in a clinical environment. Melio’s goal is to ultimately deliver a low-cost, small-footprint benchtop device compatible with the clinical workflow. Narrative We propose the development of a culture-independent molecular diagnostic test that will enable the rapid and precise detection of infections in newborns. This test uniquely combines the cutting-edge technologies of machine learning, microfluidic partitioning of samples for digital interrogation, and High-Resolution Melting of nucleic acids to create unique pathogen fingerprints for all high-risk bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens and associated resistance marker(s) present in small-volume blood samples in under 3 hours. Such a timely and accurate test is needed for effective antimicrobial therapy in newborns suspected of infection to reduce antibiotic use in non-infected patients while aggressively treating those in need with narrow spectrum antibiotics targeted towards the offending pathogens.",Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn,9778646,R43AI145567,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Asses', 'Asthma', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Custom', 'Cytolysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA amplification', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug resistance', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microfluidics', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory distress', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'genome sequencing', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'microbiome research', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'plasmid DNA', 'premature', 'prevent', 'resistance mechanism', 'single cell analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'whole genome']",NIAID,MELIOLABS INC.,R43,2019,299734,-0.03263560681298905
"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,9789907,R01GM130668,"['Area', 'Assimilations', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Brazil', 'Burn injury', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dengue', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'Zika Virus', 'base', 'chikungunya', 'climate variability', 'computational platform', 'computer infrastructure', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'economic determinant', 'experience', 'flu', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'spreading factor', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'vector control', 'vector-borne']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,366616,-0.00444382478657683
"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design New technologies afford the acquisition of dense “data clouds” of individual humans. However, heterogeneity, dimensionality and multi-scale nature of such data (genomes, transcriptomes, clinical variables, etc.) pose a new challenge: How can one query such dense data clouds of mixed data as an integrated set (as opposed to variable by variable) against multiple knowledge bases, and translate the joint molecular information into the clinical realm? Current lexical mapping and brute-force data mining seek to make heterogeneous data interoperable and accessible but their output is fragmented and requires expertise to assemble into coherent actionable information. We propose DeepTranslate, an innovative approach that incorporates the known actual physical organization of biological entities that are the substrate of pathogenesis into (i) networks (data graphs) and (ii) hierarchies of concepts that span the multiscale space from molecule to clinic. Organizing data sources along such natural structures will allow translation of burgeoning high-dimensional data sets into concepts familiar to clinicians, while capturing mechanistic relationships. DeepTranslate will take a hybrid approach to learn and organize its content from both (i) existing generic comprehensive knowledge sources (GO, KEGG, IDC, etc.) and (ii) newly measured instances of individual data clouds from two demonstration projects: (1) ISB’s Pioneer 100 and (2) St. Jude Lifetime cancer survivors. We will focus on diabetes as test case. These two studies cover a deep biological scale-space and thus can test the full extent of the multiscale capacity of DeepTranslate in a focused application. 1. TYPES OF RESEARCH QUESTION ENABLED. How can a clinician find out that the dozens of “out of range” variables observed in a patient’s data cloud, form a connected set with respect to pathophysiology pathways, from gene to clinical variable? How can the high-dimensional data of studies that measure for each individual 100+ data points of various types (“personal data clouds”) be analyzed as one set in an integrated fashion (as opposed to variable by variable) against existing knowledge bases and also be used to improve the databases? DeepTranslate addresses these two types of questions and thereby will accelerate translation of future personal data clouds into (A) care decisions and (B) hypotheses on new disease mechanisms / treatments, thereby benefiting providers as well as researchers. 2. USE OF EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES. • ISB: pioneer in personalized, big-data driven medicine (Demo Project 1); biomedical content expertise; multiscale omics and molecular pathogenesis, big data analysis, housing of databases for public access; query engine designs, GUI. • UCSD: leader in biomedical data integration; automated assembly of molecular and clinical data into hierarchical structures; translation between data types • U Montreal: biomedical database curation from literature and construction of gene/protein/drug interaction networks; machine learning, open resource database • St Jude CRH: Cancer monitoring Demo Project 2, cancer patient data analytics. 3. POTENTIAL DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. (a) Existing comprehensive clinical data sources are not uniform and not explicitly based on biological networks; cross-mapping is being performed at NLM based on lexical relationships: HPO (phenotypes) vs. SNOMED CT (for EMR) vs. IDC or Merck Manual (for diseases). Careful selection of these sources in close collaboration with NLM is needed. (b) Existing molecular pathway databases are static, based on averages of heterogeneous non-stratified populations, while the newly measured high-dimensional data clouds are varied due to intra-individual temporal fluctuation and inter-individual variation. How this will affect building of ontotypes in our hybrid approach, and how large cohorts of data clouds must be to offer statistical power is yet to be determined. Our two Demonstration Projects with their uniquely deep (high-dimensional and multiscale) data in cohorts of limited but growing size are thus crucial first steps in a long journey of collective learning in the TRANSLATOR community. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9853317,OT3TR002026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'CRH gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SNOMED Clinical Terms', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'lexical', 'molecular assembly/self assembly', 'multidimensional data', 'new technology', 'transcriptome']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT3,2019,855741,-0.02764320046384224
"ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis Project Summary The morphology (or shape) of anatomical structures forms the common language among clinicians, where ab- normalities in anatomical shapes are often tied to deleterious function. While these observations are often quali- tative, ﬁnding subtle, quantitative shape effects requires the application of mathematics, statistics, and computing to parse the anatomy into a numerical representation that will facilitate testing of biologically relevant hypotheses. Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of software tools, ShapeWorks, enable learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image seg- mentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. Despite its obvious utility for the research enterprise and highly permissive open-source license, ShapeWorks does not have a viable commercialization path due to the inherent trade-off between development and maintenance costs, and a specialized scientiﬁc and clinical market. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread ap- plicability to medicine and biology is hindered by several barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The most important roadblocks are (1) the complexity and steep learning curve of existing shape modeling pipelines and their increased computational and computer memory requirements; (2) the considerable expertise, time, and effort required to segment anatomies of interest for statistical analyses; and (3) the lack of interoperable implementations that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research laboratories. In this project, we pro- pose ShapeWorksStudio, a software suite that leverages ShapeWorks for the automated population-/patient-level modeling of anatomical shapes, and Seg3D – a widely used open-source tool to visualize and process volumet- ric images – for ﬂexible manual/semiautomatic segmentation and interactive manual correction of segmented anatomy. In Aim 1, we will integrate ShapeWorks and Seg3D in a framework that supports big data cohorts to enable users to transparently proceed from image data to shape models in a straightforward manner. In Aim 2, we will endow Seg3D with a machine learning approach that provides automated segmentations within a statisti- cal framework that combines image data with population-speciﬁc shape priors provided by ShapeWorks. In Aim 3, we will support interoperability with existing open-source software packages and toolkits, and provide bindings to commonly used programming languages in the biomedical research community. To promote reproducibility, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc test cases. This project combines an interdisciplinary research and development team with decades of experience in statistical analysis and image understanding, and application scientists to conﬁrm that the proposed developments have a real impact on the biomedical and clinical research communities. Our long-term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. ShapeWorks has been effective in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, cardiology, and orthopedics. If funded, this application will ensure the viability of ShapeWorks in the face of the ever-increasing complexity of shape datasets and support its availability to biomedical researchers in the future, as well as provide opportunities for use in a wide spectrum of new biological and clinical applications, including anatomy reconstruction from sparse/low- dimensional imaging data, large-scale clinical trials, surgical planning, optimal designs of medical implants, and reconstructive surgery.","ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis",9882865,U24EB029011,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Mail', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Psychology', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'medical implant', 'open source', 'outreach', 'particle', 'patient population', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2019,340827,-0.009213937955812407
"Acquisition of a next-generation computing cluster We request funds to purchase our next-generation computing cluster to support computationally intensive NIH-funded research at Washington University in St. Louis. This system will become the foundation of the Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC) to support our active, diverse user community. It has been designed to meet our current and future computing needs. It adds additional capabilities to support emerging fields such as “Deep Learning”. The CHPC currently supports over 775 users from 300 different groups across 33 departments. 58 papers have cited the CHPC. The Center has a proven funding model and is economically sustainable. The Center has partnered with other University organizations to offer training workshops, not only on the use of the cluster, but also on introductory programming for users with no prior programming experience. If this proposal is funded, we will be able to continue to support this ever-growing diverse community of researchers. The proposed system would replace critical components including the management node, the login nodes, the storage, and upgrade the Infiniband networking. We would add substantial upgrades to our computing power with state-of-the-art processors, increased memory capacity for growing jobs, General Purpose Graphical Processing units (GPGPUs), and new capabilities for “Deep Learning”. Nearly all fields of NIH-funded research are faced with increasingly large data sets that require additional computing power to analyze.

"Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing Millions of Americans receive evidence-based counseling for substance use problems each year. Many evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are “talk based” therapies, such as motivational interviewing (MI), but the existing research-based methodology for evaluating counseling quality is to record sessions and use human rating teams to evaluate them. However, using humans as the assessment tool via behavioral coding is prohibitive in cost and time, can be error prone, and is virtually never used in the real world. Technology is needed that can analyze the speech patterns and spoken language of counseling sessions, provide automatic and intuitive quality scores, and summarize these in actionable feedback. Rapid, performance-based quality metrics could support training, ongoing supervision, and quality assurance for millions of evidence-based counseling sessions for substance abuse each year. Lyssn.io is a start-up targeting the development of implementation-focused technology to support evidence-based counseling. Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient. Lyssn.io includes expertise in speech signal processing, machine learning, user-centered design, software engineering, and clinical expertise in evidence-based counseling. Previous NIH-funded research laid a computational foundation for generating MI quality metrics from speech and language features in MI sessions, and led to a prototype of a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The current Fast-Track SBIR proposal includes Phase I, which will focus on understanding clinical workflows, assessing usability, and initial validation of machine learning of MI fidelity measures in the opioid treatment program at Evergreen Treatment Services (ETS) clinic in Seattle, WA. Phase II will focus on robust validation of the speech and language technologies underlying the CORE-MI tool, and development of scalable supervision protocols that integrate CORE-MI supported feedback for counselors. Finally, we will conduct a quasi-experimental evaluation of CORE-MI supported supervision and training at a second ETS clinic in the Puget Sound, focusing on acceptability, usability, and adoption, the impact on supervision, improved MI fidelity and preliminary evidence of increased client retention. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance in MI for substance abuse. Most evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are in-person psychotherapy and counseling interventions, such as motivational interviewing. There are currently no methods for evaluating the quality of such counseling interventions in the real world to support training, supervision, and quality assurance. Building on an existing prototype, Lyssn.io – a technology start-up focused on scalable and cost-efficient human-centered technologies – will enhance and evaluate a cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant clinical support software tool that uses automated speech recognition and machine learning in an community based opioid replacement clinic.","Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing",9741887,R44DA046243,"['Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Counseling', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'automated speech recognition', 'automobile accident', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'dashboard', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'gun homicide', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid treatment program', 'overdose death', 'prediction algorithm', 'protocol development', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'research and development', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'sound', 'speech processing', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment services', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual', 'visual feedback']",NIDA,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R44,2019,553403,-0.10495593693816058
"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,9846955,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2019,621318,-0.01525588062826465
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections. Validating the molecular targets of these compounds for in vivo nerve growth will enable future drug discovery projects focused on these targets.",Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury,9688127,R01NS100531,"['Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Complement 5a', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Control Animal', 'Contusions', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Failure', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery of Function', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Viral Vector', 'Walking', 'axon growth', 'axon regeneration', 'axonal sprouting', 'behavior test', 'behavioral outcome', 'central nervous system injury', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injured', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'light microscopy', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'targeted agent', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,465464,-0.02945061209250267
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology.

"Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software. Abstract (Proposal title: Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational and Data Processing Tools and Software.): This proposal presents a focused plan for expanding the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) to meet the evolving needs of neuroscientists engaged in computationally intensive research. The NSG project began in 2012 with support from the NSF. Its initial goal was to catalyze progress in computational neuroscience by reducing technical and administrative barriers that neuroscientists faced in large scale modeling projects involving tools and software which require and run efficiently on high performance computing (HPC) resources. NSG's success is reflected in the facts that (1) its base of registered users has grown continually since it started operation in early 2013 (more than 800 at present), (2) every year the NSG team successfully acquires ever larger allocations of supercomputer time (recently more than 10,000,000 core hours/year) on academic HPC resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery (XSEDE – that coordinates NSF supercomputer centers) program by writing proposals that go through an extremely competitive peer review process, and (3) it has contributed to large number of publications and Ph.D thesis. In recent years experimentalists, cognitive neuroscientists and others have begun using NSG for brain image data processing, data analysis and machine learning. NSG now provides over 20 tools on HPC resources for modeling, simulation and data processing. While NSG is currently well used by the neuroscience community, there is increasing interest from that community in applying it to a wider range of tasks than originally conceived. For example, some are trying to use it as an environment for dissemination of lab-developed tools, even though NSG is not suitable for that use because of delays from the batch queue wait times of production HPC resources, and lack of features and resources for an interactive, graphical, and collaborative environment needed for tool development, benchmarking and testing. “Forced” use of NSG for development and dissemination makes NSG's operators a “person-in-the-middle” bottleneck in the process. Another issue is that newly developed data processing tools require high throughput computing (HTC) usage mode, as opposed to HPC, but currently NSG does not provide access to compute resources suitable for HTC. Additionally, data processing workflows require features such as the ability to transfer large size data, process shared data, and visualize output results, which are not currently available on NSG. The work we propose will enhance NSG by adding the features that it needs to be a suitable and efficient dissemination environment for lab-developed neuroscience tools to the broader neuroscience community. This will allow tool developers to disseminate their lab-developed tools on NSG taking advantage of the current functionalities that are being well served on NSG for the last six years such as a growing user base, an easy user interface, an open environment, the ability to access and run jobs on powerful compute resources, availability of free supercomputer time, a well-established training and outreach program, and a functioning user support system. All of these well-functioning features of NSG will make it an ideal environment for dissemination and use of lab-developed computational and data processing neuroscience tools. The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) was first implemented to enable large scale computational modeling of brain cells and circuits used to study neural function in health and disease. This new project extends NSG's utility to support development, dissemination and use of new tools by the neuroscience community for analyzing enormous data sets produced by advanced experimental methods in neuroscience.",Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software.,9882822,U24EB029005,"['Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain cell', 'collaborative environment', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'image processing', 'interest', 'models and simulation', 'open data', 'operation', 'outreach program', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trend', 'webinar']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2019,390806,-0.004743088196666927
"3D temperature control to study biological processes Project Summary Temperature control technology is necessary for a broad range of biologically relevant processes including organ-on-chip operation, biomolecular kinetics, cell growth, studying gene function with temperature-sensitive mutations, cancer cell resistance to hyperthermia treatments, protein crystallization, and DNA analysis. Most biosensing devices lack the needed temperature measurement accuracy and precise temperature control to understand the thermal mechanisms of these processes. For example, temperature variations of 0.2°C can activate heat shock proteins, increasing the resistance of cancer cells to thermal ablation treatment, but reported temperature accuracies are often near ±1°C. This proposal aims to revolutionize the biomedical temperature measurement and control ecosystem by developing technology, models, and validated devices capable of microscopic, spatially resolved temperature sensing and control at ±0.1°C accuracy (10x better than what is used in most biosensing systems). Microfluidics is a promising technology for an extremely broad range of biomedical applications that notably lacks the necessary temperature accuracies and spatial temperature control to effectively study biothermal mechanisms. This proposal intends to impact human health by developing disruptive temperature control tools to accelerate biomedical innovation in thermally sensitive processes. Our group recently demonstrated the capacity to measure temperature at a single point with fluorescent dyes, achieving a ±0.05°C noise floor by using machine learning techniques. We have also 3D printed a cell-based genotype and phenotype assay device with cell growth chambers, monoliths for mRNA capture & fluorescence measurement, and integrated pumps and valves in a volume of only 2.2 mm × 2.2 mm × 1 mm. Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal will build on these successes by developing 3D printing technologies that easily incorporate complex temperature sensing, heating, and cooling channels, coupled with multi-physics/CAD models to rapidly iterate through the prototype development cycle. These advances will be used in Aim 3 to construct a microscopically temperature-controlled chip to measure DNA melt curves to determine the zygosity of a Factor 5 Leiden. This will show that the technology can detect the subtle difference in melting temperature that is undetectable by most PCR machines, as a proof-of-concept before the technology can be applied to other biological process. The overall objective of these studies is to develop a suite of affordable technologies researchers can use to understand biothermal mechanisms to lay the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Project Narrative The instruments we use to study the effects of temperature on biological processes are less accurate than humans’ own ability to perceive temperature changes. The proposed research will develop improved microscopic temperature sensing & control technologies and demonstrate them by performing DNA analysis in a 3D printed device. Because the technology is cheap and accurate, it will be widely accessible to any lab, increasing our ability to understand the fundamental role biothermal processes have in disease occurrence, diagnosis, and treatment.",3D temperature control to study biological processes,9732034,R15GM132868,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Automation', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA analysis', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Factor Analysis', 'Factor V', 'Floor', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genotype', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Heat shock proteins', 'Heating', 'High temperature of physical object', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperthermia', 'Institution', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Plant Resins', 'Prevention', 'Printing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Quantum Dots', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Temperature Sense', 'Testing', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Thermometry', 'Thermoreceptors', 'Thromboembolism', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Venous', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'cell growth', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'gene function', 'graduate student', 'hyperthermia treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'melting', 'new technology', 'operation', 'organ on a chip', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'success', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,439058,-0.039082809154087024
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9750736,R01EB021396,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'clinical translation', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data pipeline', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2019,434944,-0.01330857296946699
"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program.

"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,9645854,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2019,169440,-0.01335297775617609
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined. Project Narrative The New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS), as a member of the CTSA Consortium, unites Rutgers University, Princeton University, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, clinical, community and industry partners in a shared vision to make New Jersey a healthier state.

"The Antibody Registry: A Community Authority for Antibody Research Resource Identifiers Project Summary  One of the most glaring yet easily addressable gaps in our current scientific workflow and publication system is improving the way that methods are reported, in particular, the lack of key methodological details necessary for interpreting and reproducing a study. Most authors continue to cite the name of the reagent, like an antibody using the vendor, and the city where the vendor is located, but omit the catalog and lot number making antibodies very difficult to track down, thereby reducing reproducibility of the paper. The Resource Identification, RRID, Initiative has successfully implemented a solution to this lack of identification, by asking authors to include a persistent unique identifier (RRID) for each antibody along with a standard syntax that includes the lot information. This syntax is now required in about 100 journals and accepted in at least 400, was accepted into the EQUATOR network of standards and is under consideration by the JATS committee, the NISO standard for journal article metadata. For antibodies, RRIDs are assigned by the AntibodyRegistry.org, which accepts full catalogs from antibody companies and individual antibody records from authors, who are unable to locate the record for the antibody that they used in a study or one which they created in their lab. This process should be made as easy as possible for authors, and through text analysis we have devised a set of tools that should help authors create better records with less work.  The AntibodyRegistry.org was created as part of an academic project and it has successfully incorporated millions of antibody records, thousands of which have now been cited in scientific papers using the RRID syntax. The use of RRID is growing, and in order to support the longer term sustainability of the AntibodyRegistry.org, a core community authority for RRIDs, this resource needs to be enhanced to align with the available commercial and non-commercial funding sources. We propose the addition of features, valuable to antibody companies and journals, to improve market intelligence and reporting around antibodies. We also propose to auto-generate antibody entries for authors and curators when submitting/curating an antibody to decrease the time it takes to complete the task, thereby reducing the barrier to entry and cost. Project Narrative The AntibodyRegistry.org is a catalog of antibodies used in research and serves as the antibody identifier source for the Research Resource Identifier (RRID) initiative. The use of these identifiers improves rigor and transparency in compliance with both journal and NIH standards. As the RRID initiative grows, the AntibodyRegistry.org is becoming an increasingly well-used and valuable resource; requiring increased attention from curation staff. Improvements to the AntibodyRegistry.org are needed to increase commercial value and thereby its sustainability, decrease curation cost, and provide a higher level of service to the scientific community.",The Antibody Registry: A Community Authority for Antibody Research Resource Identifiers,9680073,R41GM131551,"['Adopted', 'Antibodies', 'Asia', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Businesses', 'California', 'Catalogs', 'Cities', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Electronic Mail', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Europe', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Generations', 'Glare', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Reagent', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'authority', 'base', 'cost', 'improved', 'information framework', 'journal article', 'syntax', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,"SCICRUNCH, INC.",R41,2019,149373,-0.012295071196460854
"Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST) Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat bacterial infections. Clinical microbiology laboratories guide appropriate treatment through antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of patient bacterial isolates. However, increasingly, pathogens are developing resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials, requiring AST of less commonly used or recently introduced agents for which no commercially available or FDA-cleared testing methods exist. Agar and broth dilution are gold standard methods for AST that can be used to test any antimicrobial; however, labor and technical complexity precludes their use in hospital-based clinical laboratories. Therefore, bacterial isolates often must be sent to a reference laboratory with a 4-6 day delay in results. Furthermore, even standard methods require overnight incubation prior to readout. Therefore, there exists a significant AST testing gap in which current methodologies cannot adequately address the need for rapid results in the face of unpredictable susceptibility profiles. Our laboratory has recently verified inkjet printer-based digital dispensing technology as a novel platform to facilely perform reference AST for any antimicrobial at will. In this proposal, we aim to combine this methodology with advanced microscopy to leapfrog traditional AST capabilities through: (1) development of a method for microscopic imaging of bacterial replication on a solid-phase, 384-well microplate AST format, thereby allowing determination of susceptibility for any drug at will in 4 hours and (2) development and application of advanced image analysis for automated susceptibility calls. This new platform is designated MAST for microscopy-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The clinical diagnostic performance of the platform will be optimized against an AST reference method for accuracy and precision using a large panel of well-characterized clinical isolates. We anticipate establishing a prototype platform that will address the AST testing gap and thereby help our health system more effectively address the antimicrobial resistance threat. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, it is no longer possible to accurately predict which antimicrobials will be effective against life-threatening bacterial illness. Testing bacteria directly for response available therapies may take several days. Therefore, a new technology platform called MAST is proposed to allow us to determine which antibiotics can treat a bacteria infection in a matter of hours and thereby address our current, clinically unacceptable antimicrobial testing gap.",Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST),9697702,R21AI130434,"['Address', 'Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Nutrient', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Printing', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Solid', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'antimicrobial', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'clinical diagnostics', 'convolutional neural network', 'digital', 'direct application', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'response', 'supervised learning']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2019,223354,-0.02467516124155434
"Multiscale Modeling of Enzymatic Reactions and Firefly Bioluminescence Abstract Enzyme functionality is a critical component of all life systems. Whereas advances in experimental methodology have enabled a better understanding of factors that control enzyme function, critical components of the reaction space such as highly unstable intermediates and transition states are best accessed for evaluation through computational simulations. Similarly, computational methodology continues to provide a key resource for probing excited-state processes such as bioluminescence. Combined ab initio quantum mechanical molecular mechanical (ai-QM/MM) simulations are, in principle, the preferred choice in the modeling of both processes. But ai-QM/MM modeling of enzymatic reactions is now severely limited by its computational cost, where a direct ai-QM/MM free energy simulation of an enzymatic reaction can take 500,000 or more CPU hours. Meanwhile, ai-QM/MM modeling of firefly bioluminescence is also hindered by the computational accuracy, where it has yet to produce quantitatively correct predictions for the bioluminescence spectral shift with site-directed mutagenesis. The goal of this proposal is to accelerate ai-QM/MM simulations of enzymatic reaction free energy and to improve the quality of ai-QM/MM-simulated bioluminescence spectra, so that ai-QM/MM simulations can be routinely performed by experimental groups. This will be achieved via a) using a lower-level (semi-empirical QM/MM) Hamiltonian for sampling; b) an enhancement to the similarity between the two Hamiltonians by calibrating the low-level Hamiltonian using the reaction pathway force matching approach, in conjunction with several other methods. The expected outcomes of this collaborative effort include: a) advanced methodologies for accelerated reaction free energy simulations and accurate bioluminescence spectra predictions, which will be released through multiple software platforms; b) a fundamental understanding of reactions such as Kemp elimination and polymerase-eta catalyzed DNA replication; c) a deeper insight into the role of macromolecular environment in the modulation of enzyme catalytic activities or bioluminescence wavelengths, which can further enhance our capability of designing new enzymes and bioluminescence probes. Narrative This project aims to develop quantum-mechanics-based computational methods to more quickly model enzymatic reactions and more accurately model bioluminescence spectra. It will lead to reliable and efficient computational tools for use by the general scientific community. It will facilitate the probe of enzymatic reaction mechanisms and the computer-aided design of new bioluminescence probes.",Multiscale Modeling of Enzymatic Reactions and Firefly Bioluminescence,9864664,R01GM135392,"['Adopted', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioluminescence', 'Calibration', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Electrostatics', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Fireflies', 'Free Energy', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Ions', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multi-scale modeling', 'mutant', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2019,269849,-0.010093723923376584
"Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroscience is producing increasingly complex data sets, including measures and manipulations of sub- cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular mechanisms operating over multiple timescales and in the context of different behaviors and task conditions. These data sets pose several fundamental challenges. First, for a given data set, what are the relevant spatial, temporal, and computational scales in which the underlying information-processing dynamics are best understood? Second, what are the best ways to design and select models to account for these dynamics, given the inevitably limited, noisy, and uneven spatial and temporal sampling used to collect the data? Third, what can increasingly complex data sets, collected under increasingly complex conditions, tells us about how the brain itself processes complex information? The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate new, theoretically grounded methods to help researchers to overcome these challenges. Our primary hypothesis is that resolving, modeling, and interpreting relevant information- processing dynamics from complex data sets depends critically on approaches that are built upon understanding the notion of complexity itself. A key insight driving this proposal is that definitions of complexity that come from different fields, and often with different interpretations, in fact have a common mathematical foundation. This common foundation implies that different approaches, from direct analyses of empirical data to model fitting, can extract statistical features related to computational complexity that can be compared directly to each other and interpreted in the context of ideal-observer benchmarks. Starting with this idea, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish a common theoretical foundation for analyzing both data and model complexity; 2) develop practical, complexity-based tools for data analysis and model selection; and 3) establish the usefulness of complexity-based metrics for understanding how the brain processes complex information. Together, these Aims provide new theoretical and practical tools for understanding how the brain integrates information across large temporal and spatial scales, using formal, universal definitions of complexity to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of complex neural and behavioral data sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will establish new, theoretically grounded computational tools to help neuroscience researchers design and analyze studies of brain function. These tools, which will be made widely available to the neuroscience research community, will help support a broad range of studies of the brain, enhance scientific discovery, and promote rigor and reproducibility.","Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience",9789280,R01EB026945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'design', 'information processing', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,21171,-0.016708822979799077
"Expert Guiding Technology to Help Individuals with Developmental Challenges Build Life and Vocational Skills Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) remains the most effective and scientifically-validated approach to remediate the deficits due to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and intellectual disabilities (ID). There are serious challenges in delivering effective ABA: unavailability of effective treatment in many places; high instructor turnover; loss of program fidelity due to complexity and instructor variability; onerous data collection that directs attention away from the learner; and the time sink of creating required reports and charts that steals time away from instructional activities. A software platform named GAINS (Guidance, Assessment and Information System) is being developed that uniquely incorporates artificial intelligence to overcome problems in delivering ABA. GAINS is powered by expert guiding software that incorporates knowledge of ABA practice and curricula personalized for the individual with developmental challenges. Like Google Maps that guides you step-by-step and updates as you go along, GAINS guides instructors and caregivers and adapts to client responses on the fly. In this way, expert guiding technology reduces a priori training requirements in ABA while providing real- time apprenticeship coaching to overcome variability in instructor experience and improve program fidelity. Improved program fidelity promotes better learning outcomes of individuals with ASD and ID. The project will evaluate and iteratively innovate expert guiding technology to support the powerful, but difficult to implement, ABA technique of Task Analysis (TA). There are two overarching aims: 1) conduct scientifically-valid, clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of expert guiding technology to support instructors to better help individuals with developmental challenges due to ASD and ID learn life and vocational skills and use the results in Phase I to develop larger, more comprehensive clinical trials to be conducted in Phase II; and 2) use clinical trials in Phase I and Phase II to more effectively identify and prioritize iterative innovations in expert guiding technology as part of successive Design Science Research Cycles. Single Case Research Designs (SCRD) will be used to evaluate expert guiding technology interventions to support Task Analysis. SCRDs are a viable alternative to large group studies such as randomized clinical trials. Single case studies involve repeated measures, and manipulation of an independent variable. SCRD studies allow for rigorous experimental evaluation of intervention effects and provide a strong basis for establishing causal inferences. Advances in design and analysis techniques for SCRD have made SCRD studies increasingly popular in educational and psychological research. Chimes Delaware will be the site for clinical trials. Chimes Delaware is one of the largest providers of community services for adults with intellectual, autism, and co-occurring disabilities. The project team has worked together for many years and is uniquely qualified. If successful, the increase of scientifically-validated technical capabilities of expert guiding technology will profoundly affect clinical practice. The clinical trials proposed in this project will provide new scientific knowledge on the efficacy of expert guiding technology to overcome problems in delivering quality ABA therapy. Iterative innovations of expert guiding technology will greatly increase the technical capabilities.

"Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to extend its innovative software platform — BioAssay Express (BAE, version 1.0) — which helps biologists to quickly and easily encode their plain-text biological assay protocols into formats suitable for computational processing. In Phase 2B, CDD will further enhance BAE so that it can markup a bioassay with a comprehensive, detailed set of annotations that completely specifies the protocol, step by step. In its current state of development in Phase 2, BAE 1.0 enables scientists to summarize the English language text that specifies an experimental protocol, supplementing it with machine-interpretable descriptors. At the end of Phase 2B, BAE 2.0 will output a detailed machine- interpretable version that will be completely equivalent to, and can optionally substitute for, the traditional English language method description. The enhanced BAE 2.0 software will enable scientists engaged in early stage drug discovery to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures and intelligently aggregate datasets across research groups. An important benefit will be facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility by (1) flagging differences between closely related assays; (2) correlating differences in protocols with differences in results; and (3) improving the reproducibility of experiments conducted in different laboratories, to highlight potential causes of divergences. The project will continue to leverage the related broad initiatives at NIH and elsewhere that are working to promote translational research, gather screening data via open repositories, and apply sophisticated ontologies to classify these datasets. Our project targets the intersection of these disparate initiatives and unifies them by making their complex standards and guidelines for praxis realistically accessible to researchers who want to focus on their scientific work To encourage adoption, the software will prioritize intuitive ease of use by scientists who are not informatics experts, harmonize with existing laboratory workflows, minimize the extra effort of annotation, integrate seamlessly into preclinical data management platforms (including but not limited to CDD’s own CDD Vault), and deliver clear and immediate benefits to the user as part of an integrated experience. This combination of new capabilities and extreme ease of use will accelerate translational drug discovery efforts by empowering software platforms that bridge the divide between biologists and medicinal chemists to apply sophisticated tools — long available on the chemistry side — for the first time also to the biological side, and thus across both domains. Existing software can already easily connect screening results to chemical structures. This new platform will further connect these data to the purpose and methodology of the screens. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures, thereby facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility of data and assays. This fundamental capability ultimately accelerates translating new experimental discoveries into the development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9720905,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,291940,-0.029658114112879646
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9701262,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Uterus', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mechanical properties', 'microvesicles', 'multidimensional data', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'preservation', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2019,650539,-0.016458896120070985
"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice.

"Acceleration techniques for SimSET SPECT simulations Abstract The Simulation System for Emission Tomography (SimSET) is one of the foundational tools for emission tomography research, used by hundreds of researchers worldwide for both positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). It has proven to be accurate and efficient for both PET and low energy SPECT studies; because SimSET uses a geometric model for its SPECT collimation, it is less accurate for high energy isotopes. This application proposes to address this with the use of angular response functions (ARFs), a technique that has proven to accurately model SPECT collimation and detection for high-energy isotopes more efficiently than full photon-tracking simulations. In addition, we propose a novel ARF-based importance sampling method that will speed these simulations by a factor of >50. The generation of ARF tables is another consideration: it is extremely compute intensive and has caused ARF to be used only when a large number of simulations are needed using the same isotope/collimator/detector combination. For this reason, we also propose application of importance sampling to speed the generation of ARF tables by a factor 5, and the creation of a library of angular response functions for popular isotope/collimator/detector combinations. The former will lessen the computational cost of generating the tables, the latter will, for many users/uses, eliminate the need to generate ARF tables at all. This will greatly expand the potential applications of ARF-based simulations. Our first aim is to accelerate SimSET SPECT simulations without sacrificing accuracy. This will be accomplished by synergistically utilizing two tools: variance reduction and angular response function (ARF) tables. Variance reduction includes importance sampling and forced detection. We hypothesis that these techniques combined with information from our angular response function tables will improve SimSET simulation efficiency by >50 times of SPECT simulations of specific radioisotopes (e.g., I-123, Y-90, etc.). Our second aim is to accelerate ARF table generation. This will be accomplished by using importance sampling methods in the generation of ARFs. We further propose to use an adaptive stratification scheme that will simulate photons for a given table position only as long as required to determine its value to a user-specified precision. Our third aim is to create a library of pre-calculated ARF tables for popular vendor isotope/collimator/detector configurations. These ARF tables will then be made publically available for download through the SimSET website. With a registered user base of >500, we believe that these enhancements to SimSET will have far reaching impact on research projects throughout the world. Narrative The overall goal of this work is to develop methods to speed up the SimSET Monte Carlo-based simulation software for single photon computed tomography (SPECT) imaging systems by greater than 50-fold. This type of speed up with enable new research that was previously impractical due to the computation time required for simulation. In addition, all software tools and tables developed within this project will be made available via a web-based host.",Acceleration techniques for SimSET SPECT simulations,9751297,R03EB026800,"['90Y', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Collimator', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Industrialization', 'Institution', 'Isotopes', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Photons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radioisotopes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vendor', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cost', 'detector', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'response', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'synergism', 'thallium-doped sodium iodide', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R03,2019,77750,-0.0008686689223270458

"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data.

"Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK Abstract Thousands of medical researchers around the world use VTK —the Visualization Toolkit— an open-source, freely available software development toolkit providing advanced 3D interactive visualization, image processing and data analysis algorithms. They either use VTK directly in their in-house research applications or indirectly via one of the multitude of medical image analysis and bioinformatics applications that is built using VTK: Osirix, 3D Slicer, BioImageXD, MedINRIA, SCIRun, ParaView, and others. Furthermore, VTK also provides 3D visualizations for clinical applications such as BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system and Zimmer’s prosthesis design and evaluation platform. VTK has been downloaded many hundreds of thousands of times since its initial release in 1993. Considering its broad distribution and prevalent use, it can be argued that VTK has had a greater impact on medical research, and patient care, than any other open-source visualization package.  This proposal is in response to the multitude of requests we have been receiving from the VTK medical community. The aims are as follows:  1. Aim 1: Adaptive visualization framework: Produce an integrated framework that supports  visualization applications that balance server-side and client-side processing depending on data size,  analysis requirements, and the user platform (e.g., phone, tablet, or GPU-enabled desktop).  2. Aim 2: Integrated, interactive applications: Extend VTK to support a diversity of programming  paradigms ranging from C++ to JavaScript to Python and associated tools such as Jupyter Notebooks,  integrating with emerging technologies such as deep learning technologies.  3. Aim 3: Advanced rendering, including AR/VR: Target shader-based rendering systems and AR/VR  libraries that achieve high frame rates with minimal latency for ubiquitous applications that combine  low-cost, portable devices such as phones, ultrasound transducers, and other biometric sensors for  visually monitoring, guiding, and delivering advanced healthcare.  4. Aim 4: Infrastructure, Outreach, and Validation: Engage the VTK community and the proposed  External Advisory Board during the creation and assessment of the proposed work and corresponding  modern, digital documentation in the form of videos and interactive web-based content. Project Narrative The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software library for the interactive display and processing of medical images. It is being used in most major medical imaging research applications, e.g., 3D Slicer and Osirix, and in several commercial medical applications, e.g., BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system. VTK development began in 1993 and since then an extensive community of users and developers has grown around it. However, the rapid advancement of cloud computing, GPU hardware, deep learning algorithms, and VR/AR systems require corresponding advances in VTK so that the research and products that depend on VTK continue to deliver leading edge healthcare technologies.

"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers. The proposed research will generate a model of how data science and network analysis can be used to understand the implementation of a complex evidence-based practice.",A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,9781491,R01HL140362,"['Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Community Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evidence based practice', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Height', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypoxemia', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intensive Care Units', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nurses', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Professional Organizations', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tidal Volume', 'Variant', 'base', 'community setting', 'computer science', 'dissemination research', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'health care settings', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'learning strategy', 'lung injury', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'research data dissemination', 'respiratory', 'response', 'theories']",NHLBI,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2019,747700,-0.017849033555357472

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9995278,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'CXCL11 gene', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Site', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,64234,-0.029658114112879646
"Stasys Medical: A Rapid, Microfluidic Blood Test Sensitive to Platelet Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Antiplatelet medications are a critical component to manage cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which is a prevalent affliction in the US. While monitoring platelet therapy is of increasing importance for the identification of hypo- or hyper-responsive patients, there is not a clear picture of the medical value of tailored antiplatelet therapy using currently available platelet function tests. Currently, US FDA cleared assays of platelet function designed to be near the patient measure platelet adhesion and aggregation. Stasys Medical is developing a system based on patented platelet contraction sensors to assay platelet contraction force as a biomarker for platelet dysfunction. In the current project, the Company will build on preliminary data to demonstrate that the force biomarker is sensitive to platelet inhibition via multiple pathways. Specifically, aims are designed to 1) correlate the platelet contractile force measurements to inhibition of platelet activation and adhesion pathways, and 2) benchmark the force assay to standard platelet function tests. The go/no-go criteria for moving to Phase II is demonstration that platelet force is sensitive to specific inhibitors and that the assay can identify platelet dysfunction currently missed by existing standard platelet function assays. In the Phase II project we will leverage data generated in the current project to develop an algorithm that can automatically identify antiplatelet medications. Clinically, this will be a valuable tool to identify medication non-responders. Taken together, the project will be used to support the Company’s 510(k) submission to FDA with claims directed at evaluating platelet function to assess clinical conditions, such as bleeding risk, associated with the use of antiplatelet drugs, and during and following cardiovascular surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antiplatelet medications are a critical component to manage cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which is a prevalent affliction in the US.

"Bridging Statistical Inference and Mechanistic Network Models for HIV/AIDS Network models are used to investigate the spread of HIV/AIDS, but rather than assuming that the members of a population of interest are fully mixed, the network approach enables individual-level specification of contact patterns by considering the structure of connections among the members of the population. By representing individuals as nodes and contacts between pairs of individuals as edges, this network depiction enables identification of individuals who drive the epidemic, allows for accurate assessment of study power in cluster- randomized trials, and makes it possible to evaluate the impact of interventions on the individuals themselves, their partners, and the broader network. There are currently two major mathematical paradigms to the modeling of networks: the statistical approach and the mechanistic approach. In the statistical approach, one specifies a model that states the likelihood of observing a given network, whereas in the mechanistic approach one specifies a set of domain-specific mechanistic rules at the level of individual nodes, the actors in the network, that are used to evolve the network over time. Given that mechanistic models directly model individual-level behaviors – modification of which is the foundation of most prevention measures – they are a natural fit for infectious diseases. Another attractive feature of mechanistic models is their scalability as they can be implemented for networks consisting of thousands or even millions of nodes, making it possible to simulate population-wide implementation of interventions. Lack of statistical methods for calibrating these models to empirical data has however impeded their use in real-world settings, a limitation that stems from the fact that there are typically no closed-form likelihood functions available for these models due the exponential increase in the number of ways, as a function of network size, of arriving at a given observed network. We propose to overcome this gap by advancing inferential and model selection methods for mechanistic network models, and by developing a framework for investigating their similarities with statistical network models. We base our approach on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a family of methods developed specifically for settings where likelihood functions are intractable or unavailable. Our specific aims are the following. Aim 1: To develop a statistically principled framework for estimating parameter values and their uncertainty for mechanistic network models. Aim 2: To develop a statistically principled method for model choice between two competing mechanistic network models and estimating the uncertainty surrounding this choice. Aim 3: To establish a framework for mapping mechanistic network models to statistical models. We also propose to implement these methods in open source software, using a combination of Python and C/C++, to facilitate their dissemination and adoption. We believe that the research proposed here can help harness mechanistic network models – and with that leverage some of the insights developed in the network science community over the past decade and more – to help eradicate this disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network models are used to gain a more precise understanding of human behavioral factors associated with the spread of HIV/AIDS in order to develop more effective interventions to halt the epidemic. There are two main mathematical paradigms for modeling networks, the statistical approach and the mechanistic approach, and given that the latter directly models individual-level behaviors – modification of which is the foundation of most prevention measures – mechanistic models are a natural fit for infectious diseases. Lack of statistical methods for calibrating these models to empirical data has so far impeded their use in real-world settings, and we therefore propose to develop parameter inference and model selection methods for mechanistic network models in order to endow the biomedical community with these powerful tools.",Bridging Statistical Inference and Mechanistic Network Models for HIV/AIDS,9817000,R01AI138901,"['AIDS prevention', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Adoption', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Epidemic', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Prevention Measures', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'SET Domain', 'Science', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'effective intervention', 'high dimensionality', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'network models', 'open source', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'stem', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment strategy']",NIAID,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,334891,-0.024413704785112775
"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,9693291,R01HG010040,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Length', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Medical Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'contig', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genome analysis', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'light weight', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'open source', 'preservation', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2019,397125,-0.03306743958101426

The AUGS/DUKE Urogynecology Clinical Research Educational Scientist Training (UrogynCREST) program will prepare participants to recognize the critical role that data play in delivering high quality health care. It brings together expertise in health service and women’s health research, medical informatics and prediction modeling. This program will target Urogynecology Faculty at the Assistant Professor level who seek successful careers in health services research (HSR) and analytics. Participants will obtain skills through a combination of didactic and interactive coursework; hands-on manipulation of data through extraction, cleaning, and analysis; and project-based one on one mentoring. The UrogynCREST program will be an interactive, hands-on educational program with centralized activities organized and delivered by distance through a popular on-line learning platform called Sakai, with educational software designed to support teaching, research and collaboration. A diverse faculty with expertise in data sciences teaches courses and the advanced methodology required to perform HSR. Yearly in-person meetings at the annual American Urogynecologic Society meeting enhance networking and the development of partnerships between participants from various institutions, as well as, interactions with the mentors and other HSR in the field. The program’s strategy allows national leaders with particular skills in the field to provide their knowledge to the participants and help mentor them through development of a relevant research question and identification of an appropriate and existing database(s) to address the question. With the guidance of a dedicated statistician and analyst programmer, participants will learn and perform the necessary computer programming needed to extract, clean and analyze these data. Participants whose projects involve the development of prediction models in the form of scores, nomograms or other tools will learn how to build and validate such tools in the existing project. Each participant’s project will culminate in the completion of a submitted manuscript to a peer- reviewed journal or study proposal and publicly available tools when relevant. Overall, the program will shape future scientific leaders in Urogynecology by encouraging the development of clinical-scientists and provide the skills and resources for invigorating data discovery and tools for investigations in HSR specifically addressing (PFDs).

"COINSTAC: Decentralized, Scalable Analysis of Loosely Coupled Data The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.","COINSTAC: Decentralized, Scalable Analysis of Loosely Coupled Data",9938885,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'commune', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data anonymization', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'preservation', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,585151,0.008661207032292305
"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point. Our collaborative databases, multivariate analyses and innovative antibody optimization strategies will establish platforms for discovery and delivery of much-needed treatments against these and other infectious diseases.",Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats,9676860,U19AI142790,"['Address', 'Alphavirus', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Arenavirus', 'Arthritogenic', 'Biological Assay', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Disease', 'Ebola virus', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Filovirus', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Lassa virus', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Monoclonal Antibody Therapy', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primate Diseases', 'Reagent', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'biodefense', 'chikungunya', 'clinical development', 'design', 'experience', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mosquito-borne', 'multidisciplinary', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'research study', 'structural biology', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,U19,2019,7168390,-0.010729262672099974
"Augmented Reality Platform for Feedback and Assessment in STEM elementary education ABSTRACT This SBIR Phase I project will build evidence-based content, challenges and assessments that promote: simulation-based learning; troubleshooting and critical-thinking; and diversity and inclusion in STEM learning. The approach will be transferable by design to teaching and measuring learner performance across scientific disciplines. Emerging digital content in virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) is already transforming science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education from the abstract and static learning models of the past to the applied and dynamic learning experiences of the future. These technologies have promise in delivering simulation environments capable of nurturing deep learning and higher-level thinking in K-12 students through practical experience, hand-on exercises and real-life applications, such as troubleshooting. Digital AR and VR educational content is beginning to address and develop these skills, but a platform has yet to be developed to effectively enable broad adoption in elementary settings. Cost efficient methods to provide formative feedback and gather summative evaluations for Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) is also an unmet need. The successful completion of the proposed project will provide an evidence-centered content delivery and assessment framework as well as tool for addressing NGSS performance expectations that is transferable across topic areas and readily scalable for large-scale national implementation. The content will intentionally incorporate aspects of context and diversity of characters to ensure inclusion of groups that are historically underrepresented – specifically females and ethnic minorities. NARRATIVE Success in the workforce of the future will require the high-level thinking skills that the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) emphasize. Emerging digital content in virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) is transforming science and engineering education from the abstract and static learning models of the past to the applied and dynamic learning experiences of the future, through practical simulation-based experiences, but these lack the capability for performance assessment crucial to teachers and decision makers.

"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. ​A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image data set is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focus on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest.

"Bioinformatics Tools for Circadian Biology Circadian rhythms are fundamental for understanding biology: they date back to the origin of life, they are found in virtually every species from cyanobacteria to mammals, and they coordinate many important biological functions from the sleep-wake cycle, to metabolism, and to cognitive functions. Circadian rhythms are equally fundamental for health and medicine: modifications in diet have been linked to modification in circadian rhythms at the molecular level; disruptions of circadian rhythms have been linked to health problems ranging from depression, to learning disorders, to diabetes, to obesity, to cardiovascular disease, to cancer, and to premature ageing; finally, a large fraction of drug targets have been found to oscillate in a circadian manner in one or several tissues, suggesting that a better understanding of circadian oscillations at the molecular level could have direct applications to precision medicine, for instance by optimizing the time at which drugs are taken.  To better understand circadian oscillations at the molecular level, modern high-throughput technologies are being used to measure the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites along the circadian cycle in different organs and tissues, and under different conditions. However, the informatics tools for processing, analyzing, and integrating the growing wealth of molecular circadian data are not yet in place.  This effort will fill this fundamental gap by developing and disseminating informatics tools that will enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental insights about the organization and regulation of circadian oscillations, their roles in health and disease, and their future applications to precision medicine. Specifically, through a close collaborations between computational and experimental scientists, this effort will: (1) Bring the power of deep learning methods to bear on the analyses of omic time series to determine, for instance, which molecular species are oscillating, their characteristics (period, phase, amplitude), and to predict the time/phase associated with a measurement taken at a single time point; (2) Develop Cyber-TC, an extension of the widely used Cyber-T software, for the differential analysis of circadian omic time series and expand MotifMap, a widely used genome-wide map of regulatory sites to better understand circadian regulation; and (3) Develop Circadiomics, an integrated database and web portal as a one-stop shop for circadian data, annotations, and analyses. All data, software, and results will be freely available for academic research purposes and broadly disseminated through multiple channels to benefit both the circadian community and the broader bioinformatics community. Circadian rhythms are fundamental for biology and medicine. Modern high-throughput technologies are revealing how the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites oscillate with the day and night cycle in almost every species, tissue, and cell. In close collaboration with biologists, this project will develop the informatics tools that will enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental insights about the organization and regulation of circadian oscillations, their roles in health and disease, and their future applications to precision medicine.",Bioinformatics Tools for Circadian Biology,9690782,R01GM123558,"['Address', 'Ally', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolism', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Site', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'annotation  system', 'bioinformatics tool', 'circadian', 'circadian regulation', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'deep learning', 'direct application', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein metabolite', 'software development', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web portal']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2019,328155,-0.016450022371596495
"PiNDA - Fully integrated software platform for Preimplantation Genetic Testing - Aneuploidy (PGT-A) PROJECT SUMMARY  Since its inception 40 years ago, in vitro fertilization (IVF) has resulted in the birth of more than 1 million babies in the United States, and has revolutionized the field of reproductive medicine. Unfortunately, the success rate of IVF is still exceedingly low, especially for women >40 years old, with only 15.5% of implanted embryos resulting in pregnancy. This is partly due to the cytological method used for pre-implantation screening, which cannot detect the most common genetic defect during IVF, aneuploidy (i.e. chromosomal copy-number variation). Aneuploidy is linked to higher rates of miscarriage, and occurs more often in women >40 years of age; thus, aneuploidy has been a frequent target for genetic screening to improve IVF outcomes.  Pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) refers to a variety of techniques aimed at detecting changes in chromosomal copy number, with the goal of identifying high-quality euploid embryos for implantation. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made it possible to screen embryos at higher levels of precision, and across a wider range of genetic defects, including mosaicism, triploidy and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Despite these remarkable advances, there are still significant challenges with PGT-A sequencing. Indeed, the most commonly implemented software for PGT-A (i.e. BlueFuse® ) are bundled with specific sequencing platforms (i.e. VeriSeq®), and are only designed to test for aneuploidy. Furthermore, existing pipelines are not user-friendly or customizable, which is a serious obstacle prohibiting the use of NGS by clinicians / embryologists. A more accessible bioinformatics platform is desperately needed that will bridge the gap between PGT-A sequencing and IVF outcomes.  Basepair™ is an innovator in efficient, user-friendly, web-based NGS analysis systems, with fully automated ChIP-, RNA-, ATAC-, and DNA-Seq bioinformatics pipelines available online. Here, Basepair will deliver PiNDA™, the first fully integrated software solution for comprehensive PGT-A analysis.

"Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases 7. Project Summary/Abstract There is an urgent need to support research that generates high-quality evidence to inform clinical decision making. Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) achieve the highest standard of evidence for the evaluation of community-level effectiveness of intervention strategies against infectious diseases. However, there is a need to develop new methods to improve the design and analysis of CRTs because unique and complicated analytical challenges arise in such settings. One such issue relates to the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the degree to which individuals within a community are more similar to one another than to individuals in other communities. Design and analysis of CRTs must take into account the ICC. Lack of accurate information on the ICC jeopardizes the power of CRTs, leads to suboptimal choices of analysis methods and complicates the interpretation of study results. However, reliable information on the ICC is difficult to obtain. A robust and efficient approach for estimating ICCs is based on the second-order generalizing estimating equations. However, its use has been limited by considerable computational burden and poor convergence rates associated with the existing algorithms solving these equations. The first aim addresses these computational challenges. Missing data are ubiquitous and can lead to bias and loss of efficiency. The second aim proposes to develop novel robust and efficient methods for estimating ICCs in the presence of informative missing data. For infectious diseases, the underlying contact/transmission networks give rise to complicated correlation structure. The third aim is to develop network and epidemic models to project the ICC. User-friendly software will be developed to facilitate the implementation of new methods. An immediate application of the proposed methods is their application to the Botswana Combination Prevention Project to improve the estimation of intervention effect and to generate reliable ICC estimates for designing future CRTs in the same population. The proposed methods can be applied to other ongoing and future CRTs, and more broadly, to longitudinal studies and agreement studies where ICCs are also of great interest. The proposed research is significant, because success in addressing these issues will improve the ability to design efficient and well-powered CRTs and the precision in estimating the effects of intervention strategies. Innovation lies in the development of improved computing algorithms adapting approaches from deep learning, the use of semiparametric efficiency theory, and the integration of network modeling, epidemic modeling and statistical inference. The results of the proposed research will benefit both ongoing and future CRTs, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately expedite the control of infectious diseases. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because improved methodologies for the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials will benefit both ongoing and future studies, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately improve public health response intended to control the spread of infectious diseases. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIAID’s mission that pertains to conducting and supporting research to prevent infectious diseases and to respond to emerging public health threats.",Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases,9785367,R01AI136947,"['AIDS prevention', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Botswana', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ebola virus', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Epidemic', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'collaboratory', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'high standard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'success', 'systems research', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'user friendly software']",NIAID,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2019,247413,-0.0035050481080045426
"Development of dictyBase, an online informatics resource PROJECT SUMMARY dictyBase is the model organism database (MOD) for the eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum and related species. A community resource, widely supported by the research community, dictyBase contains gold standard expert literature curation of genes, functional annotations using the Gene Ontology and a wide range of genomic resources. Dictyostelium is widely used to study cellular processes such as cell motility, chemotaxis, signal transduction, cellular response to drugs, and host-pathogen interactions. Dictyostelium's genome contains significant orthologs of vertebrate, yeast and microbial genes, attracting researchers interested in a wide variety of biological topics including human disease, multicellular differentiation and comparative genomics. dictyBase enables researchers to search, view and download up-to-date genomic, functional and technical information. It is also widely used by teachers/instructors due to the wealth of available teaching materials and research protocols. Dictyostelium investigators depend on dictyBase as their primary community resource, where help from dictyBase staff (dictyBase help line) or from other users (Dicty ListServ, moderated by dictyBase) is available. We are in the final stages of deploying our completely new technology stack. By the end of this year dictyBase will be run entirely as a cloud-based application. This propoal seeks support to continue operating and expanding this important community resource. Our goals for this proposal are: (Aim 1) To continue (a) expert curation by dictyBase curators and enable (b) Community curation leveraging our strong relationship with the community. We will use additional sequence data to (c) update the AX4 reference genome sequence and improve the efficiency of curation by using (d) Deep learning-based linking of papers to genes prioritizing them for further analysis and curation. (Aim 2) We will improve dictyBase utility and usability by implementing (a) Bulk annotation methods for importing large-scale data sets using both (i) a web interface and (ii) a script/command line method. (b) We will add 10 additional Dictyostelid genomes using automated methods to annotate them. We will improve usability by implementing a (c) concurrent blast search with a new user interface and integrate this with the JBrowse display. (Aim 3) To expand the data and increase the richness of annotations available in dictyBase we will implement mechanisms to capture, store and display: (a) additional context to GO annotations (i) using existing GO extensions and (ii) annotating and displaying biological pathways using GO CAM models; (b) integrate and display genome wide insertion mutant information for over 20 thousand insertional mutants; and (c) develop a graphical display of spatial expression data using Dictyostelium anatomy ontology terms (i) by adding a track in JBrowse for genes annotated with spatial / anatomy expression terms, and (ii) creating a graphical display of these annotations via our Circos-based dashboard tool. As other data sets become available we will add them to dictyBase and develop methods to display the data and make it searchable. PROJECT NARRATIVE dictyBase is the model organism database (MOD) for the eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum and related species, Dictyostelium is widely used for research in the biomedical, genetic, and environmental domains. The database uses the genome of Dictyostelium to organize biological knowledge developed using this experimental system, and dictyBase is manually curated and up-to-date with current literature. This application proposes capturing new types of data and providing tools to search and visualize that data.","Development of dictyBase, an online informatics resource",9738586,R01GM064426,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Chemotaxis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dictyostelium', 'Dictyostelium discoideum', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Eukaryota', 'FAIR principles', 'Funding', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Information Resources', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Nomenclature', 'Ontology', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cloud based', 'comparative genomics', 'contig', 'dashboard', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'genome annotation', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interest', 'microbial', 'model organisms databases', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'reference genome', 'response', 'teacher', 'tool', 'usability', 'web interface']",NIGMS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,506287,-0.02153197376677139

"Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research Capitalizing on the transformative opportunities afforded by the extremely large and ever-growing volume, velocity, and variety of biomedical data being continuously produced is a major challenge. The development and increasingly widespread adoption of several new technologies, including next generation genetic sequencing, electronic health records and clinical trials systems, and research data warehouses means that we are in the midst of a veritable explosion in data production. This in turn results in the migration of the bottleneck in scientific productivity into data management and interpretation: tools are urgently needed to assist cancer researchers in the assembly, integration, transformation, and analysis of these Big Data sets. In this project, we propose to develop the Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research (SDL-BR) system, a cluster-computing software environment that enables rapid data ingestion, multifaceted data modeling, logical and semantic querying and data transformation, and intelligent resource discovery. SDL-BR is based on the idea of a data lake, a distributed store that does not make any assumptions about the structure of incoming data, and that delays modeling decisions until data is to be used. This project adds to the data lake paradigm methods for semantic data modeling, integration, and querying, and for resource discovery based on learned relationships between users and data resources. The SDL-BR System is a distributed computing software solution that enables research institutions to manage, integrate, and make available large institutional data sets to researchers, and that permits users to generate data models specific to particular applications. It uses state of the art cluster computing, Semantic Web, and machine learning technologies to provide for rapid data ingestion, semantic modeling and querying, and search and discovery of data resources through a sophisticated, Web-based user interface.",Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research,9765194,R44CA206782,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalogs', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Ingestion', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Legal', 'Legal patent', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'cluster computing', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'handheld mobile device', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'melanoma', 'migration', 'natural language', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'success', 'systems research', 'targeted treatment', 'technology development', 'time use', 'tool']",NCI,"INFOTECH SOFT, INC.",R44,2019,238768,-0.01512219817313255
"Adaptive & Individualized AAC The heterogeneity of the more than 1.3% of Americans who suffer from severe physical impairments (SPIs) preclude the use of common augmentative or alternative communication (AAC) solutions such as manual signs, gestures or dexterous interaction with a touchscreen for communication. While efforts to develop alternative access methods through eye or head tracking have provided some communication advancements for these individuals, all current technologies suffer from the same fundamental limitation: existing AAC devices require patients to conform to generic communication access methods and interfaces rather than the device conforming to the user. Consequently, AAC users are forced to settle for interventions that require excessive training and cognitive workload only to deliver extremely slow information transfer rates (ITRs) and recurrent communication errors that ultimately deprive them of the fundamental human right of communication. To meet this health need, we propose the first smart-AAC system designed using individually adaptive access methods and AAC interfaces to accommodate the unique manifestations of motor impairments specific to each user. Preliminary research by our team of speech researchers at Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital (Communication Center Lab) and Boston University (STEPP Lab), utilizing wearable sensors developed by our group (Altec, Inc) have already demonstrated that metrics based on surface electromyographic (sEMG) and accelerometer measures of muscle activity and movement for head-mediated control can be combined with optimizable AAC interfaces to improve ITRs when compared with traditional unoptimized AAC devices. Leveraging this pilot work, our team is now proposing a Phase I project to demonstrate the proof-of-concept that a single sEMG/IMU hybrid sensor worn on the forehead can provide improvements in ITR and communication accuracy when integrated with an AAC interface that is optimized through machine learning algorithms. The prototype system will be tested and compared to a conventional (non-adaptable) interface in subjects with SPI at a collaborative clinical site. Assistance by our speech and expert-AAC collaborators will ensure that all phases of technology development are patient-centric and usable in the context of clinical care. In Phase II we will build upon this proof-of-concept to design a smart-AAC system with automated optimization software that achieves dynamic learning which adapts to intra-individual changes in function through disease progression or training as well as inter-individual differences in motor impairments for a diverse set of users with spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, ALS, and other SPIs. The innovation is the first and only AAC technology that combines advancements in wearable-sensor access with interfaces that are autonomously optimized to the user, thereby reducing the resources and training needed to achieve effective person-centric communication in SPI, through improved HMI performance and reduced workload. This project addresses the fundamental mission of NIDCD (National Institute for Deafness and Communication Disorders) to provide a direct means of assisting communication for people with severe physical impairments caused by stroke, high level spinal cord injury, neural degeneration, or neuromuscular disease. Leveraging wearable access technology (which has barely been explored for AAC users), we will develop a first-of-its-kind adaptive tablet interface tailored to individual users through advanced movement classification algorithms. Through these efforts, we aim to provide an improved Human Machine Interface (HMI) that is able to accommodate varying degrees of inter- and intra-subject residual motor function and context dependent impairments to provide individuals with SPI the opportunity for improved societal integration and quality of life.",Adaptive & Individualized AAC,9907832,R43DC018437,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'American', 'Boston', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication Methods', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Facial Muscles', 'Fatigue', 'Forehead', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human Rights', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workload', 'alternative communication', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical care', 'clinical research site', 'communication device', 'deafness', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'novel', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation engineering', 'rehabilitation science', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'signal processing', 'technology development', 'touchscreen', 'two-dimensional', 'wearable device']",NIDCD,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2019,224701,-0.05422665431459688
"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE MC-IU effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing, exploration, and download of different types of tissue and individual cell data. The CCF will use different visual interfaces in order to exploit human and machine intelligence to improve data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, biology, and biomedical data standards. The goal is to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimensional spatial basemap of the human body with associated data overlays. This basemap will be designed for online exploration as an atlas of tissue maps composed of diverse cell types, developed in close collaboration with the HIVE MC-NYGC team. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across multiple levels (whole body, organ, tissue, cells). MC-IU will work in close collaboration with the HIVE Infrastructure and Engagement Component (IEC) and tools components (TCs) to connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources driven by spatial context. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an ex- tensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spa- tial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical.

"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice.

"PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry Project Summary Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research, there has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. Such sharing, evaluation, and integration are necessary if computational modeling efforts are to be useful not only in generating reliable and accurate accounts of how brain subsystems operate, but also of how they interact to give rise to higher cognitive functions, and how disruptions of such interactions may give rise to disturbances of mental function observed in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This proposal seeks to meet this need by developing PsyNeuLink: an open source, Python-based software environment that makes it easy to create new models, import and/or re-implement existing ones, integrate these within a single software environment that will facilitate head-to-head comparison of comparable models, the assembly of complementary models into system-level models, and serve as a common repository for the documentation and dissemination of such models for both research and didactic purposes (i.e., publication, education, etc.). These goals will be pursued under two Specific Aims: 1) Extend the scope of modeling efforts that PsyNeuLink can accommodate by: i) enhancing its application programmer interface (API) used to add new components and interfaces to statistical analysis tools and other modeling environments (such as PyTorch, Emergent and ACT-R; ii) enriching its Library by adding PsyNeuLink implementations of influential models of neural subsystems; and iii) developing a publicly available workbook of simulation exercises as both an introduction to PsyNeuLink and for use in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry curricula. 2) Accelerate PsyNeuLink by developing a custom compiler that preserves its simplicity and flexibility, while dramatically increasing its speed, to make it suitable for simulation of large and complex system-level models, and for parameter estimation, model fitting, and model comparison. This project will exploit the power and accelerating use of Python, and modern just-in-time compilation methods to develop a tool designed specifically for the needs of systems-level Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry. This promises to open up new opportunities for research at the systems-level — a level of analysis that is crucial both for understanding how human mental function emerges from the interplay among neural subsystems, and how disturbances of individual neural subsystems impact this interplay, disruptions of which are almost certainly a critical factor in neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. This proposed project seeks to address this need by developing a standard software platform for the construction, documentation, sharing, and integration of computational models of brain function, that promises to accelerate the study of how system-level interactions give rise to mental function and, critically, the kinds of disruptions of such system-level interactions produced by disturbances of individual subsystems — disruptions that are sure to be a complex but critical factor in neurological and psychiatric disorders.",PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry,9824928,R21MH117548,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Perceptual learning', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Writing', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'flexibility', 'head-to-head comparison', 'improved', 'learning network', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'open source', 'parallelization', 'preservation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,253798,-0.02182540479640118
"ACTIVE: Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (DDT COA 000032) Project Summary/Abstract Technology has the potential to accelerate clinical research and reduce the burden of participation in rare diseases such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). DMD is an x-linked genetic disorder that results in progressive muscle weakness with loss of ambulation by 10-12 years of age, progression of arm weakness resulting in difficulty with self-feeding and other self-care activities in adolescence, and death resulting from cardiopulmonary insufficiency by age 30 years. Studies in rare diseases are inherently difficult due to a small recruitment pool and a limited number of sites that possess the experience and resources to participate as a study site. An outcome measure that quantifies change in both ambulant and non-ambulant individuals with minimal evaluator training could enable more efficient data collection in multi-site clinical trials. Our upcoming submission, DDT COA 0032, Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (ACTIVE), has the potential to meet this need. ACTIVE is a 65-second game utilizing a skeletal-tracking algorithm to quantify workspace volume (WSV) elicited through maximal arm reaching overhead, side-to-side, and forward while also encouraging trunk lean in each direction. Our studies have shown that ACTIVE is valid and reliable in quantifying WSV in persons with DMD across the span of age and abilities. However, to increase access and portability of a tool for use across trial sites, it is critical that tool has sound scientific and technological construction. ACTIVE WSV was originally built upon the Microsoft Kinect and Kinect One for Xbox platforms. The skeletal tracking algorithm developed by Microsoft vastly exceeds all other programs as it had the full backing of the Microsoft machine. Unfortunately, the Kinect, in its additional sense, has been abandoned for more current artificial intelligence applications. The Microsoft Kinect Azure will soon be released with higher resolution and programming capabilities. Our full DDT submission has been delayed as each new camera release has required reprogramming of our software to ensure valid and reliable results. Our team has recently expanded to include software development partners, The Plan Works (thePlan), who have the technological expertise to alter our current codebase to ensure transfer of ACTIVE across camera sensor platforms is more efficient and reliable as we expect ongoing technological advances to provide opportunities for continued advances. To this end, our current application seeks support to verify the technology of the ACTIVE WSV system to 1) confirm the use of unique code that can be ported across platforms over time and 2) improving the ease of use and limit training needed at a growing number of inexperienced centers. Project Narrative Our upcoming submission, DDT COA 0032, Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (ACTIVE), is a 65-second outcome assessment that quantifies a person’s workspace volume and has the potential to expand the enrollment pool by measuring both ambulant and non-ambulant subjects. While the scientific construction of the tool is sound, ongoing technological advances and changes have made it challenging to port our software across camera platforms. Our proposal seeks funding to support final software updates to ensure changes in technology components (i.e. camera sensor systems) or coding instability will not interfere with clinical trial data collection and allow us to complete our final submission package.",ACTIVE: Abilities Captured Through Interactive Video Evaluation (DDT COA 000032),9989528,U01FD006883,[' '],FDA,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,U01,2019,215170,-0.004264733342154596

"Learning Dynamics of Biological Processes from Time Course Omics Datasets Complex biological processes, including organ development, immune response and disease progression, are inherently dynamic. Learning their regulatory architecture requires understanding how components of a large system dynamically interact with each other and give rise to emergent behavior. Recent experimental advances have made ii possible to investigate these biological systems in a data-driven fashion al high temporal resolution, allowing identification of new genes and their regulatory interactions. Longitudinal omics data sets are becoming increasingly common in clinical practice as well. Information on these collections of interacting genes can be integrated to gain systems-level insights into the roles of biological pathways and processes, including progression of diseases. Consequently, developing interpretable methods for learning functional relationships among genes, proteins or metabolites from high-dimensional time series data has become a timely research problem. The nature of these time-course data sets presents exciting opportunities and interesting challenges from a statistical perspective. Typical time-course omics data sets are challenging because of their high-dimensionality and non-linear relationships among system components. To tackle these challenges, one needs sophisticated dimension-reduction techniques that are biologically meaningful, computationally efficient and allow uncertainty quantification. Methods that incorporate prior biological information (e.g., pathway membership, protein-protein interactions) into the data analysis are good candidates for analyzing such high-dimensional systems using small samples. Here, we will develop three core methods to address the above challenges - (Aim 1): an empirical Bayes framework for clustering high-dimensional omics time-course data using prior biological knowledge; (Aim 2): a quantile-based Granger causality framework for learning interactions among genes or metabolites from their lead-lag relationships; and (Aim 3): a decision tree ensemble framework for searching cascades of interactions among genes from their temporal expression profiles. Our interdisciplinary team of statisticians and scientists will analyze time-course omics data from three research projects: (i) innate immune response systems in Drosophila, (ii) developmental process in mouse models, and (ii) longitudinal metabolite profiling of TB patients. These insights will be used to build and validate our methodology, which will be implemented in a publicly available software. This proposal is innovative in its incorporation of prior biological knowledge in the framework of novel dimension reduction techniques for interrogating high-dimensional time-course omics data. This research is significant in that it will impact basic sciences by elucidating data-driven, testable hypotheses on the regulatory architecture of biological processes, and clinical practice by monitoring disease progression and prognosis. n/a",Learning Dynamics of Biological Processes from Time Course Omics Datasets,9903643,R01GM135926,"['Biological Process', 'Data Set', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Time']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,351443,-0.02315739644982839

"A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks New advances in biomedical research have made it possible to collect multiple data “views” — for example, genetic, metabolomic, and clinical data — for a single patient. Such multi-view data promises to offer deeper insights into a patient's health and disease than would be possible if just one data view were available. However, in order to achieve this promise, new statistical methods are needed.  This proposal involves developing statistical methods for the analysis of multi-view data. These methods can be used to answer the following fundamental question: do the data views contain redundant information about the observations, or does each data view contain a different set of information? The answer to this question will provide insight into the data views, as well as insight into the observations. If two data views contain redundant information about the observations, then those two data views are related to each other. Furthermore, if each data view tells the same “story” about the observations, then we can be quite conﬁdent that the story is true.  The investigators will develop a uniﬁed framework for modeling multi-view data, which will then be applied in a number of settings. In Aim 1, this framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data (e.g. a single set of patients, with both clinical and genetic measurements), in order to determine whether a single clustering can adequately describe the patients across all data views, or whether the patients cluster separately in each data view. In Aim 2, the framework will be applied to multi-view network data (e.g. a single set of proteins, with both binary and co-complex interactions measured), in order to determine whether the nodes belong to a single set of communities across the data views, or a separate set of communities in each data view. In Aim 3, the framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data in order to determine whether the observations can be embedded in a single latent space across all data views, or whether they belong to a separate latent space in each data view. In Aims 1–3, the methods developed will be applied to the Pioneer 100 study, and to the protein interactome. In Aim 4(a), the availability of multiple data views will be used in order to develop a method for tuning parameter selection in unsupervised learning. In Aim 4(b), protein communities that were identiﬁed in Aim 2 will be validated experimentally. High-quality open source software will be developed in Aim 5.  The methods developed in this proposal will be used to determine whether the ﬁndings from multiple data views are the same or different. The application of these methods to multi-view data sets, including the Pioneer 100 study and the protein interactome, will improve our understanding of human health and disease, as well as fundamental biology. Biomedical researchers often collect multiple “types” of data (e.g. clinical data and genetic data) for a single patient, in order to get a fuller picture of that patient's health or disease status than would be possible using any single data type. This proposal involves developing new statistical methods that can be used in order to analyze data sets that consist of multiple data types. Applying these methods will lead to new insights and better understanding of human health and disease.","A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks",9752596,R01GM123993,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Set protein', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,323659,-0.041246427877158306
"CRCNS: US-France Data Sharing Proposal: Lowering the barrier of entry to network neuroscience The field of network neuroscience has developed powerful analysis tools for studying brain networks and holds promise for deepening our understanding of the role played by brain networks in health, disease, development, and cognition. Despite widespread interest, barriers exist that prevent these tools from having broader impact. These include (1) unstandardized practices for sharing and documenting software, (2) long delays from when a method is first introduced to when it becomes publicly available, and (3) gaps in theoretic knowledge and understanding leading to incorrect, delays due to mistakes, and errors in reported results. These barriers ultimately slow the rate of neuroscientific discovery and stall progress in applied domains. To overcome these challenges, we will use open science methods and cloud-computing, to increase the availability of network neuroscience tools. We will use the platform ""brainlife.io"" for sharing these tools, which will be packaged into self-contained, standardized, reproducible Apps, shared with and modified by a community of users, and integrated into existing brainlife.io analysis pipelines. Apps will also be accompanied by links to primary sources, in-depth tutorials, and documentation, and worked-through examples, highlighting their correct usage and offering solutions for mitigating possible pitfalls. In standardizing and packaging network neuroscience tools as Apps, this proposed research will engage a new generation of neuroscientists, providing them powerful new and leading to new discoveries. Second, the proposed research will contribute growing suite of modeling analysis that can be modified to suit specialized purposes. Finally, the Brainlife.io platform will serve as part of the infrastructure supporting neuroscience research. Altogether, these advances will lead to new opportunities in network neuroscience research and further stimulate its growth while increasing synergies with other domains in neuroscience. Structural and functional networks support cognitive processes. Miswiring networks lead to maladaptive behavior and neuropsychicatric disorders. Network neuroscience is a young field that provides a quantitative framework for modeling brain networks. This project will make network neuroscientific tools available to new users via open science and cloud-computing.

"SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF EMAN FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IMAGE PROCESSING EMAN is one of the most well-established and widely used scientific image processing suites targeting the rapidly growing CryoEM/CryoET community worldwide. In turn, the CryoEM and CryoET studies which it enables permit determination of the structures of interacting macromolecules both in-vitro and in-vivo, and are being used to better understand the biochemical processes taking place in cells, to better identify potential drug targets and develop novel diagnostics. With the higher resolutions now possible in this field, direct drug interaction structural studies are now possible, and being used to gain insight into the mode of action of drugs within the cell. Unlike many newer tools in the field, such as Relion, CisTEM and CryoSparc, which focus on specific refinement tasks, EMAN is a versatile, modular suite capable of performing a variety of image processing tasks with hundreds of algorithms supporting virtually all of the standard file formats and mathematical conventions used in the field, as well as other related imaging fields. It provides an ideal platform for prototyping fundamental new algorithm developments, while still able to achieve data-limited resolution in single particle reconstruction. While high resolution single particle refinement has become routine in recent years, thanks largely to the dramatic data quality improvements provided by new detector technology, there remain significant opportunities for improvements in mitigating model bias, efficient use of data, and analysis of complexes with compositional or conformational variability. Some of the most important problems from a biological perspective involve the sort of compositional and conformational variability which remain challenging problems. The field also remains susceptible to problems of initial model bias, which are exacerbated in systems exhibiting structural variability, and as a result many structures are still published with exaggerated resolution claims. The standard protocols used by many in the field typically involve discarding a very large fraction of the raw data (as much as 80-90% in some cases), often based on qualitative assessments, raising questions related to rigor and reproducibility of structural results. In this proposal, we will develop or adapt image processing techniques to help resolve these issues, based on developments or unrealized concepts from mathematics and computer science. CryoEM and CryoET are used to study the structures of interacting biomolecules in the cell at resolutions 100x better than the best possible light microscope. This methodology permits new insights into the biomolecules which underlie disease, can shed light on structural changes in diseased cells and provide direct information on how drugs interact with the molecules they target.

"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes.

"The Enzymatic Reader Project Summary At this point in time, it is generally understood and agreed upon that single-molecule sequencing (SMS) is the future of genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and epitranscriptomics due to its significant advantages over other technologies and methods. However, in order for these advantages to be fully realized, and for SMS to become the “gold standard” sequencing approach, significant issues and hurdles must be solved and overcome. During this program, Electronic BioSciences, Inc. (EBS) aims to demonstrate a completely new and enabling SMS method that will possess the ability to directly and correctly identify individual nucleotides, including chemically modified nucleotides. During this project, we will both demonstrate the ability of this entirely new sequencing approach to sequence DNA with high accuracy (directly comparing the obtained accuracy, throughput, error mechanisms and associated rates to other SMS approaches) and correctly identify (and sequence) 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its derivatives, at the single molecule level. At the conclusion of this Phase I project, we will have successfully demonstrated an entirely new and dramatically improved SMS approach, and reduced the associated risks involved with its full future commercial developments. There is a current need within the field of next generation sequencing (NGS) or so called third generation sequencing (TGS) for new, enabling instrumentation that is capable of high-accuracy, direct, native DNA sequencing, including the ability to correctly identify canonical and modified bases, homopolymer stretches, and sequence repeats. The entirely new SMS methodology that will be developed during this project will overcome known hurdles and limitations of currently available NGS, TGS, and SMS technologies, resulting in technology that is cost-efficient, highly accurate, easy to setup and utilize, capable of de novo sequencing and modified base calling, and yields highly simplistic data for easy analysis and post possessing. Through significant advancements made during this program, this resulting technology will revolutionize the use of the genome and epigenome, radically change standard R&D and clinical practices, and greatly advance clinical diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic decision making. Project Narrative The novel single-molecule sequencing (SMS) technology developed during this project will enable high- accuracy, direct, native DNA sequencing, including the ability to correctly identify canonical and modified bases, homopolymer stretches, and sequence repeats via a cost-efficient and easy-to-use methodology. The impact of these advances in SMS will eventually enable wide-scale, routine clinical care and diagnostics toward advanced precision medicine, not just R&D. The performance and accessibility of such technology will transform the understanding and application of genomics and epigenomics, the associated clinical practices, that ability to provide precision clinical diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic decision making for improved public healthcare and wellbeing.",The Enzymatic Reader,9677956,R43HG010427,"['Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Caliber', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Church', 'Complex', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA polymerase A', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disadvantaged', 'Drops', 'Electrodes', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Length', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Logistics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Polymers', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reader', 'Reading Frames', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Stretching', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Generation Sequencing', 'Time', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'electric field', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'epitranscriptomics', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanopore', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'research and development', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,"ELECTRONIC BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2019,247611,-0.029012021708963453
"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of “non-monotone” missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ﬂawed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ﬁxed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiﬁc domains, making “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiﬁc reporting. Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Narrative We will develop, implement and disseminate an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software tool to evaluate the robustness to missing data assumptions of clinical trials in which binary outcomes are collected at ﬁxed points over time but where participants intermittently miss their scheduled assess- ments, as frequently occurs in addiction research. We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiﬁc reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9756356,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,486320,-0.008997391547867642
"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9784742,U24CA199374,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Felis catus', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'annotation  system', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data pipeline', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,533529,-0.020215818356181754
"Big Flow Cytometry Data: Data Standards, Integration and Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Flow cytometry is a single-cell measurement technology that is data-rich and plays a critical role in basic research and clinical diagnostics. The volume and dimensionality of data sets currently produced with modern instrumentation is orders of magnitude greater than in the past. Automated analysis methods in the field have made great progress in the past five years. The tools are available to perform automated cell population identification, but the infrastructure, methods and data standards do not yet exist to integrate and compare non-standardized big flow cytometry data sets available in public repositories. This proposal will develop the data standards, software infrastructure and computational methods to enable researchers to leverage the large amount of public cytometry data in order to integrate, re-analyze, and draw novel biological insights from these data sets. The impact of this project will be to provide researchers with tools that can be used to bridge the gap between inference from isolated single experiments or studies, to insights drawn from large data sets from cross-study analysis and multi-center trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE The aims of this project are to develop standards, software and methods for integrating and analyzing big and diverse flow cytometry data sets. The project will enable users of cytometry to directly compare diverse and non-standardized cytometry data to each other and make biological inferences about them.

"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9789913,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,750000,-0.015349904662953807
"The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease Most investigations of craniosynostosis focus on the dermatocranium, the second cranial skeleton to form during embryogenesis that comprises the dermal bones of the cranial vault and facial skeleton. A completely separate cranial skeleton, the chondrocranium, develops before the dermatocranium to support the embryonic brain and other sense organs. Historically, the chondrocranium has been studied across the vertebrates and is recognized as fundamental to craniofacial development, but it is not well known to craniofacial biologists and has never been studied in the laboratory mouse until now. The chondrocranium is formed of cartilage and though parts of it ossify endochondrally, other portions begin to degenerate by about embryonic day 15-16 in the mouse. By careful analysis of whole mount and histological specimens, we have documented the synchronized deterioration of select chondrocranial elements with the appearance and superimposition of particular dermal bones of the growing dermatocranium. These observations signal the existence of a mechanism for the coordinated, localized expansion (dermal bones) and resorption (cartilage) of two developmentally and evolutionarily separate skeletal systems. Our project, supported by strong preliminary data of the mouse chondrocranium, is designed to test a central hypothesis: that the chondrocranium serves as a structural and functional scaffold for the later development of dermatocranial elements including the formation of cranial vault sutures. Based on the common finding that boundaries between different cell populations often serve as tissue organizers, we recognize the establishment and maintenance of stable boundaries that restrict the mixing of different cell populations as critical to proper development, and propose a research design that interrogates the chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundary as significant to the coordinated development of the skull. We will interrogate cells at specific sites to determine the processes that function to maintain the boundaries. Then using the Fgfr2c+/C342Y mouse model for craniosynostosis, we will investigate relevant chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundaries operative in the development of two craniosynostosis phenotypes: premature closure of the coronal suture and abnormal growth of the midface. That the chondrocranium is composed of irregularly shaped cartilages, many of which are short-lived, requires that we conceive new tools for analysis. We will complete development of an innovative system to dissect and reconstruct the chondrocranium in silico from micro computed tomography images with tight temporal control, precisely delineate chondrocranial anatomy in 3D over embryonic time, and establish the role of the chondrocranium in development of the dermatocranium. Achieving our goals will enrich textbook knowledge of craniofacial development by defining the role of the chondrocranium in the production of dermatocranial phenotypes, provide information relative to the pathophysiology of countless craniofacial anomalies, and reveal potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutics. Craniofacial anomalies are common birth defects that require comprehensive, sometimes repetitive corrective surgeries to manage individual cases. To ameliorate the financial and emotional burden on patients and their families, efforts are aimed at the development of preventative therapies but these require a thorough understanding of craniofacial development. We offer novel information about the chondrocranium, the first embryonic cranial skeleton to develop, and focus on mechanisms operating within boundaries between it and the dermatocranium that are critical to craniofacial development, in normal individuals and in craniofacial disease.",The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease,9657003,R01DE027677,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Apert-Crouzon syndrome', 'Apoptosis', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Birth', 'Bone Resorption', 'Brain', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Chondrichthyes', 'Chondrocranium', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Embryonic Structures', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory mice', 'Live Birth', 'Maintenance', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Osteoblasts', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sense Organs', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal system', 'Skeleton', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vertebrates', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cleft lip and palate', 'coronal suture', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fibroblast growth factor receptor 2c', 'histological specimens', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'osteogenic', 'premature', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIDCR,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2019,523782,-0.0352241193062904
"UC Davis Alzheimer's Core Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT As reflected in recent budget increases in the National Institutes of Health, and in line with the National Alzheimer’s Project Act, there is a need to enhance and leverage resources to decrease dementia disparities and change the trajectory of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. To fill this gap, we seek to enhance the University of California Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Center (UCD ADC), which contains a diverse ethnoracial cohort (having Hispanic, Black, and non-Hispanic White decedents), through implementation of digital pathology within our Neuropathology Core. This implementation will allow for rapid transmission of pathological data for consultation and collaborations, distribution of materials for educational purposes, tissue specimen archiving, and image analysis. In addition, by having a digital pathology with immunofluorescent capabilities will allow for viewing of the distribution (including overlap) of multiple proteins at one time within a tissue specimen. This can enhance biological studies by providing spatial relationships of proteins resulting in a deeper phenotype of disease. This supplement application is designed to support equipment and leverage and enhance infrastructure to allow the UCD ADC the ability to 1) purchase a whole slide image system to digitize existing and future histologically stained samples 2) leverage and enhance current servers and database systems to allow for storage and rapid retrieval of digital images and their data and 3) leverage and enhance hardware to develop and deploy pipelines for quantitative computational methodologies for pathologies found within a diverse ethnoracial cohort of Alzheimer’s disease brains. The UCD ADC continues to excel and expand in its research initiatives to collect and provide brain specimens and pathological data on a diverse population of individuals at various stages of cognitive ability and dementia risk. This supplement will further enable suitable infrastructure for enhancement of current collaborations and facilitate emerging collaborations by providing a means to share and analysis pathology on digitized whole slide images. PROJECT NARRATIVE Digital microscopy paired with machine learning algorithms has aided in diagnosis and provide more quantitative pathology data to unlock the secrets of diseases. These technologies are needed within the dementia field, specifically in diverse cohorts, as disease presentations may differ. By implementing state of the art imaging systems and analysis, the goals of this supplement are to enhance the ADC’s ability to provide greater access to high quality pathological data for educational, consultation and collaborative purposes, infrastructure to pursue digital solutions for more quantitative analysis, and safe secure storage of histologic specimens.",UC Davis Alzheimer's Core Center,9852188,P30AG010129,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Archives', 'Autopsy', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Budgets', 'California', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational Materials', 'Equipment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glass', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Knowledge', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Senile Plaques', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Thioflavin S', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'beta pleated sheet', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disease phenotype', 'histological specimens', 'histological stains', 'human tissue', 'imaging system', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuropathology', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'spatial relationship', 'synergism', 'transmission process', 'whole slide imaging']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P30,2019,289154,-0.05293201094163088
"Protected Radiomics Analysis Commons for Deep Learning in Biomedical Discovery Abstract  Development of emerging imaging systems for biological and medical imaging often involves multi-dimensional acquisition protocols and thus correspondingly the need for complex reconstruction algorithms and advanced machine learning algorithms in order to produce the desired resulting image and quantitative tumor characteristics. This proposal requests funding for a high performance computing system, entitled Protected Radiomics Analysis Commons for Deep Learning in Biomedical Discovery, to further the development and application of deep learning techniques to quantitative image analysis and image reconstruction. There are 12 specific NIH projects that will benefit from the proposed computing infrastructure system. We present the 12 projects through examples from within four Specific Research Topics areas: (a) tomographic image reconstruction, (b) quantitative image analysis, (c) functional quantification, and (d) association of radiomics (image data) with phenotypic and genomic data. The proposed system is a computing cluster, which uses ScaleMP's Versatile SMP software to aggregate the cluster nodes into a single symmetric multiprocessing computer. The major hardware components consist of 1 HP Enterpris\e ProLiant DL380 server and 8 Apollo 6500 compute nodes, with a total of 2.1 TB of main memory, 18 Intel Xeon E5-2640v4 10-core CPUs, and 32 nVidia Tesla P100 GPUs. The servers will be connected via a 100Gbps EDR Infiniband network. In addition, three important software components, which aim to reduce the complexity of the computing environment and increase researcher productivity, will be integrated into the hardware components: the aforementioned ScaleMP vSMP to create a single virtual computer from the cluster nodes, Cendio ThinLinc to provide remote desktop graphical login services, and Bitfusion Flex AI Platform which provides GPU virtualization, scheduling, and optimization, as well as curated container deployment of common deep learning frameworks. The Protected Radiomics Analysis Commons for Deep Learning in Biomedical Discovery will allow researchers to expedite, extend, and translate their current NIH funding in areas of many-dimensional image reconstruction and image analysis algorithms – all of which will benefit greatly from deep learning approaches – within a secure, protected, and HIPAA- compliant sharable environment.

The Protected Radiomics Analysis Commons for Deep Learning in Biomedical Discovery will allow researchers to expedite, extend, and translate their current NIH funding in areas of many- dimensional image reconstruction and image analysis algorithms – all of which will benefit greatly from deep learning approaches – within a secure, protected, and HIPAA-compliant sharable environment.",Protected Radiomics Analysis Commons for Deep Learning in Biomedical Discovery,9494294,S10OD025081,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Schedule', 'Secure', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'biological systems', 'cluster computing', 'computer cluster', 'deep learning', 'genomic data', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'phenotypic data', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'reconstruction', 'tomography', 'tumor', 'virtual']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,S10,2018,338913,-0.022483285891038894
"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Successful completion of this project will result in novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, predictive models for patient outcomes, and powerful computational frameworks generalizable to critical problems in various diseases.",Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models,9573854,R35GM128638,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2018,388750,-0.02690084959175234
"Machine Learning and Deep Learning Solutions Supplement: Matching Methods for Causal Inference with Complex Data NARRATIVE SUMMARY The landscape of data formats is rapidly expanding, with image, text and other complex formats becoming available for health related outcomes. By considering such data within the context of observational causal inference, they can be leveraged to improve clinical decisions, help evaluate treatment efficacy by estimating individualized treatment effects and help develop intelligent therapeutic systems where individualized treatments can be deployed. In R01EB025021, we concentrate on understanding how nearly exact matching can be achieved in the presence of a large number of categorical covariates. The proposed approach (called FLAME - Fast Large Almost Matching Exactly) is able to quickly learn which categorical covariates are important and to produce high quality matches \citep{wang2017flame,dieng2018collapsing}. The main shortfall in the proposed work for R01EB025021 is that it does not naturally extend to more complex data types, it only works for categorical data in which each feature is meaningful. {\bf This proposal will develop new statistical and computational tools for causal analysis of complex data structures.} Our new approach is called {\emph Matching After Learning to Stretch (MALTS)}. For each unit (e.g. patient), we propose learn a latent representation of their covariate information and a distance metric on the latent space such that units that are matched tend to provide accurate estimates of treatment effect. MALTS can use deep learning to encode the latent representations for the units, or it can learn basis transformations in linear space (stretching and rotation matrices) for simpler continuous data types. We will develop the MALTS algorithm, and apply it in a medical context. Our goal is to construct high quality matches for the following types of data: (i) medical images, such as x-rays and CT scans, (ii) medical record data, (iii) time series data (continuous EEG data), (iv) a combination of any of the first three types of data. We aim to leverage the newly developed tools to continue our evaluation of the efficacy of isolation for flu-like ailments as well as to apply them more broadly to publicly available modern datasets such as the MIMIC III database. Reliable and consistent causal analysis of public health interventions requires the use of massive previously unavailable datastreams. For example, evaluation of the efficacy of isolation interventions on flu-like-illness spread must include information on friendships and interactions between individuals, biometric information, imaging, longitudinal health record data as well as standard demographic data. The proposed research provides machine learning and deep learning tools for properly employing this data for the identification and quantification of causal effects of such treatments that can lead to the development of better public health interventions.",Machine Learning and Deep Learning Solutions Supplement: Matching Methods for Causal Inference with Complex Data,9750434,R01EB025021,"['Algorithms', 'Biometry', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Series', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'computerized tools', 'data format', 'deep learning', 'efficacy evaluation', 'flu', 'health record', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'novel strategies', 'public health intervention', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,98714,-0.010964260005651443
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

"QuBBD: Deep Poisson Methods for Biomedical Time-to-Event and Longitude Data  The proposed research directly addresses the mission of NIH's BD2K initiative by developing appropriate tools to derive novel insights from available Big Data and by adapting sophisticated machine learning methodology to a framework familiar to biomedical researchers. This new methodology will be one of the first to enable use of machine learning techniques with time-to-event and continuous longitudinal outcome data, and will be the first such extension of the deep Poisson model. In essence, this undertaking builds the missing bridge between the need for advanced prognostic and predictive techniques among biomedical and clinical researchers and the unrealized potential of deep learning methods in the context of biomedical data collected longitudinally. To facilitate smooth adoption in clinical research, the results will be translated into terms familiar to applied practitioners through publications and well-described software packages. The application of the methodology developed will be illustrated using data from the NIH dbGAP repository, thereby further promoting the use of open access data sources. Optimal risk models are essential to realize the promise of precision medicine.

"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well.

"Machine Learning for Generalized Multiscale Modeling Project Summary/Abstract  This project develops machine learning approaches that describe statistical systems in biology. By combining analytic results calculated from the exact probabilistic description of the system with machine learning inference, our new methods present exciting opportunities to model previously inaccessible complex dynamics. The resulting Boltzmann machine-like learning algorithms present a new class of modeling techniques based on the powerful in- ference of arti cial neural networks. Further development of this approach will bring the groundbreaking advances from the surge of recent interest in machine learning into the biological modeling eld. The mathematical methods we develop will be used to derive e cient algorithms for multiscale simulation, directly applicable to large scale biological modeling. In particular, the algorithms will be used to study the dynamics of stochastic biochemistry at synapses, with direct relevance to learning and memory formation in the brain. Current studies of these processes are limited by the long timescales involved and the highly spatially organized structures featured. In addition to leveraging the machine learning expertise we are developing, we also employ new electron microscopy datasets to produce 3D reconstructions of neural tissue with unprecedented accuracy. Consequentially, we will be able to study the fundamental mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, as well as the biochemical basis of oscillatory behavior in networks of neurons that occurs during sleep. Furthermore, the interactions of these highly stochastic ion channels with electrical in neurons will be explored through groundbreaking hybrid simulation environments. The software that we will develop combines existing popular simulation tools into multiscale approaches, and will be distributed as a powerful tool to the broader biological modeling community. Its usage in further computational experiments can present a key advancement in the development of pharmaceuticals, allowing the direct study of the interactions of biochemistry and whole neuron electrophysiology without making limiting assumptions to sim- plify the simulations. This has promising implications for intervening in age-related learning de cits, as well as in neurological disorders such as Alzheimers. Finally, this proposal will bring together our existing multiscale modeling community, the National Center for Multi-scale Modeling of Biological Systems (MMBioS), with the MSM consortium. The interactions of these organizations and their communities of expert researchers will foster new collaborative work on exciting multiscale problems in biology, including applications of the machine learning frameworks and software we are developing. 1 Project Narrative  A wide variety of biological systems can be described statistically, from molecular biochemistry up to the network level activity of neurons. This work develops machine learning approaches to approximate these systems, enabling new simulation methods that bridge di erent levels of description. The resulting computational studies aim to shed light on the basis of learning and computation in the brain, and will enable the development of pharmaceutical targets for learning de cits associated with aging and neurological disorders such as Alzheimers. 1",Machine Learning for Generalized Multiscale Modeling,9791802,R56AG059602,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consequentialism', 'Coupling', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Ion Channel', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Neurosciences', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Potassium Channel', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'biological systems', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'computer studies', 'experimental study', 'information processing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical methods', 'men who have sex with men', 'microscopic imaging', 'multi-scale modeling', 'nervous system disorder', 'particle', 'postsynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'working group']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R56,2018,619053,-0.021632105858097363
"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,9523638,R01GM124443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomechanical model', 'community building', 'complex biological systems', 'data access', 'data sharing', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'member', 'new technology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'role model', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,478806,-0.003932148101707224
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE.

"Extracting rich information from biological images Project Summary  Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image samples. Whether in small­ or large­scale microscopy experiments, biologists increasingly need software to identify and measure cells and other biological entities in images, to improve speed, objectivity, and/or statistical power.  The principal investigator envisions bringing transformative image analysis and machine learning algorithms and software to a wide swath of biomedical researchers. In a decade, researchers will tackle fundamentally new problems with quantitative image analysis, using seamless imaging workflows that have dramatic new capabilities going beyond the constraints of human vision.  To this end, the PI will collaborate with biologists on important quantitative imaging projects that also yield major advancements to their open­source image analysis software, CellProfiler. This versatile, user­friendly software is indispensable for biomedical research. Launched 125,000+ times/year worldwide, it is cited in 3,400+ papers from 1,000+ laboratories, impacting a huge variety of biomedical fields via assays from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning. CellProfiler evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment that has yielded dozens of discoveries and several potential drugs.  Still, many biologists are missing out on the quantitative bioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and usable software for their needs. In addition to maintaining and supporting CellProfiler, the team will implement biologist­requested features, algorithms, and interoperability to cope with the changing land­ scape of microscopy experiments. Challenges include increases in scale (sometimes millions of images), size (20+ GB images), and dimensionality (time­lapse, three­dimensional, multi­spectral). Researchers also need to accommodate a variety of modalities (super­resolution, single­molecule, and others) and integrate image analysis into complex workflows with other software for microscope control, cloud computing, and data mining.  The PI will also pioneer novel algorithms and approaches changing the way images are used in biology, including: (1) a fundamental redesign of the image processing workflow for biologists, leveraging revolutionary advancements in deep learning, (2) image analysis for more physiologically relevant systems, such as model organisms, human tissue samples, and patient­derived cultures, and (3) data visualization and interpretation software for high­dimensional single­cell morphological profiling. In profiling, subtle patterns of morphological changes in cells are detected to identify causes and treatments for various diseases. We will also (4) integrate multiple profiling data types: morphology with gene expression, epigenetics, and proteomics. Ultimately, we aim to make perturbations in cell morphology as computable as other large­scale functional genomics data.  Overall, the laboratory’s research will yield high­impact discoveries from microscopy images, and its software will enable hundreds of other NIH­funded laboratories to do the same, across all biological disciplines. Public Health Relevance/Narrative Modern microscopy experiments are increasing in scale and scope; the research will result in pioneering computational techniques and software that will change the way microscopy images are used in biology. Biologists will use the resulting software to tackle fundamentally new problems using quantitative image analysis, including detecting changes in the appearance of cells that are overlooked by human vision and studying intact organisms and human tissue rather than isolated cells.

"Advancing Human Health by Lowering Barriers to Electrophysiology in Genetic Model Organisms Project Summary The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has proven valuable as a model for many high-impact medical conditions. The strength of C. elegans derives from the extensive homologies between human and nematode genes (60-80%) and the many powerful tools available to manipulate genes in C. elegans, including expressing human genes. Researchers utilizing medical models based on C. elegans have converged on two main quantifiable measures of health and disease: locomotion and feeding; the latter is the focus of this proposal. C. elegans feeds on bacteria ingested through the pharynx, a rhythmic muscular pump in the worm’s throat. Alterations in pharyngeal activity are a sensitive indicator of dysfunction in muscles and neurons, as well as the animal’s overall health and metabolic state. C. elegans neurobiologists have long recognized the utility of the elec- tropharyngeogram (EPG), a non-invasive, whole-body electrical recording analogous to an electrocardiogram (ECG), which provides a quantitative readout of feeding. However, technical barriers associated with whole- animal electrophysiology have limited its adoption to fewer than fifteen laboratories world-wide. NemaMetrix Inc. surmounted these barriers by developing a turn-key, microfluidic system for EPG acquisition and analysis called the the ScreenChip platform. The proposed research and commercialization activities significantly expand the capabilities of the ScreenChip platform in two key respects. First, they enlarge the phenotyping capabilities of the platform by incorporating high-speed video of whole animal and pharyngeal movements. Second they develop a cloud database compatible with Gene Ontology, Open Biomedical Ontologies and Worm Ontology standards, allowing data-mining of combined electrophysiological, imaging and other data modalities. The machine-readable database will be compatible with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. It will be accessible to all researchers to enable discovery of relationships between genotypes, phenotypes and treatments using large-scale analysis of multidimensional phenotypic profiles. The research and commercialization efforts culminate in an unprecedented integration of genetic, cellular, and organismal levels of analysis, with minimal training and effort required by users. Going forward, we envision the PheNom platform as a gold standard for medical research using C. elegans. n/a",Advancing Human Health by Lowering Barriers to Electrophysiology in Genetic Model Organisms,9467327,R44GM119906,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Amplifiers', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bacteria', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equipment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Feeds', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nematoda', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Periodicity', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Pump', 'Readability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Video Microscopy', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'commercialization', 'data mining', 'design', 'feeding', 'human disease', 'human model', 'member', 'phenotypic data', 'prevent', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'web app']",NIGMS,"NEMAMETRIX, INC.",R44,2018,510448,-0.014457101550640832
"Leveraging Twitter to monitor nicotine and tobacco-related cancer communication Patterns in Twitter data have revolutionized understanding of public health events such as influenza outbreaks. While researchers have begun to examine messaging related to substance use on Twitter, this project will strengthen the use of Twitter as an infoveillance tool to more rigorously examine nicotine, tobacco, and cancer- related communication. Twitter is particularly suited to this work because its users are commonly adolescents, young adults, and racial and ethnic minorities, all of whom are at increased risk for nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) use and related health consequences. Additionally, due to the openness of the platform, searches are replicable and transparent, enabling large-scale systematic research. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team of experts in diverse relevant fields—including public health, behavioral science, computational linguistics, computer science, biomedical informatics, and information privacy and security—will build upon our previous research to develop and validate structured algorithms providing automated surveillance of Twitter’s multifaceted and continuously evolving information related to NTPs. First, we will qualitatively assess a stratified random sample of relevant NTP-related tweets for specific coded variables, such as the message’s primary sentiment and other key information of potential value (e.g., whether a message involves buying/selling, policy/law, and cancer-related communication). Tweets will be obtained directly from Twitter using software we developed that leverages a comprehensive list of Twitter-optimized search strings related to NTPs. Second, we will statistically determine what message characteristics (e.g., the presence of certain words, punctuation, and/or structures) are most strongly associated with each of the coded variables for each search string. Using this information, we will create specialized Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically assess and categorize future Twitter data. Third, we will use this information to provide automatic assessment of current and future streaming data. Time series analyses using seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) will determine if there are significant changes over time in volume of messaging related to each specific coded variables of interest. Trends will be examined at the daily, weekly, and monthly level, because each of these levels is potentially valuable for intervention. To maximize the translational value of this project, we will partner with public health department stakeholders who are experts in streamlining dissemination of actionable trends data. In summary, this project will substantially advance our understanding of representations of NTPs on social media—as well as our ability to conduct automated surveillance and analysis of this content. This project will result in important and concrete deliverables, including open-source algorithms for future researchers and processes to quickly disseminate actionable data for tailoring community- level interventions. For this project, we gathered a team of public health researchers and computer scientists to leverage the power of Twitter as a novel surveillance tool to better understand communication about nicotine and tobacco products (NTPs) and related messages about cancer and cancer prevention. We will gather a random sample of Twitter messages (“tweets”) related to NTPs and examine them in depth and use this information to create specialized computer algorithms that can automatically categorize future Twitter data. Then, we will examine changes over time related to attitudes towards and interest in NTPs, as well as cancer-related discussion around various NTPs, which will dramatically improve our ability to better understand Twitter as a tool for this type of surveillance.",Leveraging Twitter to monitor nicotine and tobacco-related cancer communication,9503469,R01CA225773,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'County', 'Data', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Food', 'Football game', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Laws', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Opinion', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Tobacco-Related Carcinoma', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer prevention', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'ethnic minority population', 'geographic difference', 'hookah', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial minority', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'statistics', 'time use', 'tool', 'trend', 'vaping', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,505649,-0.035437555232182845
"A Modular Automated Platform for Large-scale Drosophila Experiments and Handling PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Animal model systems are a powerful tool researchers use to investigate almost all aspects of biology: genetics, development, neuroscience, disease, and more. And fruit flies – Drosophila melanogaster – with their small size, easy care, and remarkable array of available genetic toolkits, occupy a sweet spot on the model organism spectrum. Over 75% of human diseases with a genetic basis have an analogue in the fly, and Drosophila have been a part of the research for six Nobel prizes. Furthermore, the advent of CRISPR/cas9 and other modern genetic tools has opened the door to modeling other diseases and pathways, leading to greater use of Drosophila for drug screens. A great deal of the work (and the majority of the budget) involved in fly experiments is tedious manual labor, and with advances in computer vision, machine learning, and other analytic techniques, the stage is set to automate many phenotypic screens. In this Phase I SBIR, we propose a robotic system – modular automated platform for large-scale experiments (MAPLE) – that can accomplish a wide variety of fly-handling tasks in Drosophila labs. This robot is the fruit fly version of a liquid handling robot, with a large, open workspace that can house a plethora of modules and several manipulators that can move small parts and animals around that workspace. Building on a collaboration between the de Bivort Lab and FlySorter completed in 2017, we will design, fabricate and validate a commercial system that can collect virgin flies, run behavioral assays, conduct drug screens, and adapt to the needs of fly labs through easy-to-code Python scripts. By strategically combining modules and instructions to the robot, MAPLE can perform a wide variety of tasks in a fly lab, saving experimentalists from repetitive chores, cutting labor costs, and increasing scientific output. Just as pipette robots have become standard equipment in wet labs, we envision our fly handling robot will be the engine that powers Drosophila labs in academia and pharma, enabling new kinds of experiments and freeing researchers from the drudgery of fly pushing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fruit flies – Drosophila melanogaster – are a powerful model organism used in the study of disease, neuroscience, development, genetics, and recently in drug screens, too, largely through phenotypic screening. This labor-intensive work is time consuming and expensive, and ripe for automation. We propose a fly-handling robot – analogous to a liquid pipetting robot in a wet lab – that can perform a variety of tasks in Drosophila labs, free researchers from the drudgery of fly pushing, and enable a broader spectrum of experiments that will increase scientific knowledge.",A Modular Automated Platform for Large-scale Drosophila Experiments and Handling,9623017,R43MH119092,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Automation', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data Collection', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug usage', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic study', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences', 'Nobel Prize', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vacuum', 'Work', 'analog', 'bone', 'cost', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fly', 'graduate student', 'health science research', 'human disease', 'improved', 'operation', 'programs', 'repository', 'robot control', 'screening', 'tool', 'touchscreen']",NIMH,"FLYSORTER, LLC",R43,2018,348007,-0.022791054974925038
"Pediatric sepsis prediction: a machine learning solution for patient diversity Abstract  Significance:  In  this  SBIR  project,  we  propose  to  predict  and  detect  pediatric  severe  sepsis  by  developing  a  machine-­learning-­based  clinical  decision  support  system  for  electronic  health  record  (EHR)  pediatric  sepsis  screening. The pediatric population is underserved, with fundamental research and understanding of pediatric  sepsis  syndromes  lagging  behind  that  of  the  adult  population.  The  proposed  work  will  develop  machine  learning sepsis predictions on the highly heterogeneous pediatric population, by combining multi-­task learning  methods with expert clinical knowledge of how pediatric sepsis presentation is dependent on age and on pre-­ existing  conditions.  The  multi-­task  learning  approach  will  use  age  or  comorbidities  to  define  “tasks,”  each  one  associated  with  prediction  on  a  particular  subpopulation,  and  then  link  the  learning  process  together  between  tasks. Research Questions: Which methods of using these task-­defining parameters are most effective? How  can  we  most  effectively  learn  the  degree  of  similarity  between  pediatric  subpopulations  and  leverage  this  to  improve classification performance? Prior Work: InSight was originally developed to predict sepsis and septic  shock from adult EHR data. After retraining on pediatric cases, in preliminary experiments with a retrospective  set  of  pediatric  (2-­17  yr)  inpatient  encounters  (n  =  11,127;;  103  [0.9%]  severely  septic),  at  the  University  of  California  San  Francisco  (UCSF),  InSight  achieved  an  AUROC  0.912  and  0.727  for  the  detection  and  4-­hour  pre-­onset  prediction  of  sepsis.  This  performance  can  be  improved  for  better  pediatric  sepsis  prediction.  Specific  Aims:  To  empirically  evaluate  different  learning  schemes  using  age  with  and  without  multi-­task  methods,  within  the  UCSF  pediatric  severe  sepsis  data  set  (Aim  1).  To  exploit  an  expert-­proposed  network  graph  structure  for  comorbidity-­described  pediatric  subpopulations  that  provides  superior  predictive  performance  over  naïve  methods  and  graphs,  both  for  the  overall  population  and  for  underserved  subpopulations  (Aim  2).  Methods:  We  propose  to  use  multi-­task  methods  that  penalize  deviations  between  classifiers  on  neighboring  tasks  and  that  iteratively  learn  the  strength  of  these  links.  These  methods  will  be  compared with total task independence, or passing age into classifier training as an ordinary input. Criteria for  Success:  Success  will  be  shown  by  4-­hour  pre-­onset  AUROC  gains  of  0.02  (overall  population)  and  0.03  for  the previously weakest of three age subpopulations (2-­5, 6-­12, and 13-­17 yrs;; 4-­hour pre-­onset prediction, p <  0.05, McNemar’s test, 4-­fold cross-­validation). The best structure for mapping similarities between comorbidity  tasks will improve the overall AUROC by 0.03 (p < 0.05) and by 0.07 for ≥ 2 comorbidity subpopulations of ≥ 100 patients (p < 0.05). Outcome: These improvements will enable InSight to deliver strong sepsis predictive  performance across the widely heterogeneous pediatric population.         Narrative  Pediatric  sepsis  can  be  difficult  to  diagnose,  in  part  because the  pediatric  population  is  highly  heterogeneous;;  clinical  decision  support  (CDS)  systems  have  the  potential  to  aid  in  the  diagnosis  and  prediction  of  pediatric  sepsis, if the underlying diversity of the pediatric population is correctly addressed. We will develop a machine-­ learning-­based  sepsis  CDS  system  by  using  multi-­task  learning  techniques  to  define  a  set  of  “tasks,”  each  corresponding  to  predicting  severe  sepsis  in  a  clinically  distinct  subpopulation  of  pediatric  inpatients,  together  with  a  set  of  inter-­task  connections  that  share  information  between  similar  subpopulations.    This  will  enable  improved sepsis prediction across the widely heterogeneous and underserved pediatric patient population.     ",Pediatric sepsis prediction: a machine learning solution for patient

"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current clinical image modalities can be utilized to develop patient-specific computational models to pre-operatively plan transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. However, the computational modeling and simulation processes are time-consuming, which limits clinical translatability. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop algorithms using machine learning techniques to rapidly process and predict TAVR computational simulation outcomes directly from clinical image data.",A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes,9518217,R01HL142036,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Extravasation', 'Feedback', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Valves', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Postoperative Period', 'Problem Sets', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Response Elements', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stents', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'calcification', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'population based', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'speech recognition', 'time resolved data', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual clinical trial']",NHLBI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,392932,-0.018023678130655058
"Population genomics of adaptation Project Summary Malaria that results from Plasmodium falciparum is among the most globally devastating human diseases. The principle vector of malaria, mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex, are thus central targets for controlling the human health burden of Plasmodium. For nearly two decades, there have been large-scale, coordinated efforts to diminish mosquito populations, generally through spraying and insecticide treated bed nets. Indeed such control efforts have now led to a nearly 50% decrease in the rates of malaria infection in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. At present, however, control efforts of A. gambiae are being threatened by evolutionary responses within mosquitos: A. gambiae populations have shown increases in insecticide resistance as well as behavioral adaptations that allow mosquitos to avoid spraying all together. Thus adaptation of mosquitos to the control efforts themselves is currently a risk to maintain the gains made in the fight against malaria. In this proposal we lay out an integrated population genomic approach for systematically identifying regions of the A. gambiae genome that are evolving adaptively in response to ongoing control efforts. Our approach centers upon state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques that we have recently introduced for finding the signatures of selective sweeps in genomes (Schrider and Kern, 2016), coupled with the large-scale population genomic datasets currently in production by the Ag1000G consortium. Project Narrative Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has enormous impacts on human health globally. For the past 16 years, large gains have been made in decreasing the rate of malaria transmission through control of its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae; unfortunately at present these control efforts are in danger of collapse due to the evolution of insecticide resistance in the mosquitos. We aim to discover the genomic targets of such resistance through the development of sophisticated population genomic approaches and their application to state-of- the-art genome sequence datasets from Anopheles gambiae.",Population genomics of adaptation,9554999,R01GM117241,"['Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anopheles Genus', 'Anopheles gambiae', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Catalogs', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'Insecticides', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mosquito-borne infectious disease', 'Mutation', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'fight against', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'malaria infection', 'malaria transmission', 'markov model', 'novel', 'recurrent neural network', 'resistance allele', 'response', 'tool', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector mosquito']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2018,18944,-0.023294462967837076
"Automating Real-Time Localization of Target Sites in Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Tachycardia Project Summary Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with heart diseases. The majority of life-threatening VT episodes are caused by an electrical ""short circuit” that travels through narrow strands of surviving tissue inside myocardial scar. Catheter ablation treats scar-related VT by “blocking” the surviving channel that forms the circuit, commonly at the site the circuit exits from the scar. To localize a VT exit, however, remains a significant challenge. A common approach, known as pace-mapping, utilizes the principle that the VT exit serves as the origin of ventricular activation and determines the QRS morphology on 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). It thus involves repetitive electrical simulation at various sites of the heart, until locating the site that reproduces the QRS of the VT on all 12 ECG leads. While the principle behind pace- mapping is time tested, the current practice is of a ""trial-and-error"" nature and requires rapid qualitative interpretation of the ECG by clinicians, which can be time-consuming and inaccurate. This research proposes to leverage modern machine learning techniques to reform the way the principle behind pace-mapping is used. It aims to learn the relationship between the origin of ventricular activation and ECG morphology, and then use it to directly predict the exit of a VT from its ECG data. To this end, this project will include the following activities: 1) to develop a population-based model to provide pre-procedural initial localizations of VT exits using standard 12-lead ECG; 2) to integrate the population-based model with a patient-specific model in clinically-usable software to provide intra-procedural real-time guidance for localizing the exit site of a clinical VT; and 3) to assess the ability of the proposed software to improve the efficiency and accuracy of pace- mapping in a prospective clinical study. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team of computational and clinical scientists with a fruitful record of collaboration. The software delivered by this project will provide real-time assistance to clinicians for narrowing down a VT exit with a minimum amount of time and localization errors. This will substantially reduce the workload for ablating multiple VTs, potentially allowing clinicians to ablate more or even all VTs seen in a procedure. This may reduce the duration of an ablation procedure while improving its outcome. The development and deployment of the software also adds minimal cost or distractions to routine workflow. With a low barrier to clinical implementation, it will have a real potential to challenge and improve the standard practice of catheter ablation. Project Narrative Catheter ablation treats ventricular arrhythmia by destroying the culprit tissue responsible for the arrhythmia. To localize the culprit tissue, however, remains a tedious process with limited success in current practice. This project will develop inexpensive software to guide clinicians towards the culprit tissue in real time during the procedure, helping narrow down the ablation target with a minimum amount of time and localization errors.",Automating Real-Time Localization of Target Sites in Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Tachycardia,9590857,R15HL140500,"['Ablation', 'Arrhythmia', 'Attention', 'Cardiac ablation', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Encapsulated', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hybrids', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population Database', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Travel', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'Workload', 'clinical implementation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'distraction', 'improved', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'population based', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'sudden cardiac death', 'usability']",NHLBI,ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R15,2018,419810,-0.019549431606735796
"Novel Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes Defined by Functional-Anatomical, Machine-Learned Classifications Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a pervasive disease which affects over 30 million individuals worldwide, in whom it is associated with morbidity and mortality, yet for which therapeutic outcomes are suboptimal. One major limitation to mechanistic and clinical advances in AF is its taxonomy, which is based on number of days of detected AF rather than increasingly reported functional and personalized mechanisms. I reasoned that a digital and scalable AF taxonomy, based on interactions of anatomic and functional factors and clinical features, may better guide existing therapy and catalyze future mechanistic and therapeutic advances. I set out to create a predictive tool to guide therapy in AF patients using machine learning of rich mechanistic data from a large multicenter registry of patients undergoing ablation. I hypothesized that clinically actionable AF phenotypes can be defined by statistical clustering between electrophysiologic features, anatomic regions and clinical indices, that can be uncovered by physiological and statistical quantification and machine learning. I have two Specific Aims: 1) To construct a multimodal digital atlas of atrial fibrillation which registers functional indices at absolute and relative spatial locations in both atria from a multicenter registry, and make this atlas available as an open-source software resource. This deliverable will uniquely map the probability that specific mechanisms will be relevant to AF in a specific patient of given clinical characteristics. Novel pathophysiological phenotypes will be defined via probabilistic interactions in these individual components. 2) To develop a predictive tool using machine learning to estimate the likelihood that ablation at any site(s) will contribute to success tailored to individual characteristics, by learning clusters of electrophysiologic features, clinical indices, and anatomic regions in a training population and applying it to a validation cohort from a large multicenter registry. This project uses state-of-the-art computational tools and statistical methods that may reconcile divergent AF mechanistic hypotheses to define novel functional AF phenotypes and guide therapy. In the process, I will be mentored by world leading mentors, in an extraordinary training environment to facilitate this development into an independent physician-scientist in bioengineering-heart rhythm medicine. Project Narrative This research provides an avenue to define atrial fibrillation in an actionable classification rooted in pathophysiologic and mechanistic observations. Such a classification scheme would further our understanding and refine our conversation about complex arrhythmia in cardiac tissue. Only an understanding at this level is will provide truly effective and safe treatments of each individual patient’s arrhythmic condition.","Novel Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes Defined by Functional-Anatomical, Machine-Learned Classifications",9611012,F32HL144101,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atlases', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Atrium', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy trial', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'health care service utilization', 'heart rhythm', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient registry', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'predictive tools', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'trial design']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,63034,-0.0140539271420104
"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources. A) Machine learning models will be created that automatically assign probability estimates to three types of observational studies that are widely examined by systematic reviewers. B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics. A) Methods will be developed for ranking articles with respect to their relevance to a proposed new systematic review topic. B) A scoping tool will be created that displays articles ranked by predicted relevance, tagged with study design attributes, sample sizes, and Cochrane risk of bias estimates.

"Neuroinformatics platform using machine learning and content-based image retrieval for neuroscience image data This project aims to develop NeuroManager™, an innovative neuroinformatics platform for advanced parsing, storing, aggregating, analyzing and sharing of complex neuroscience image data. A core technology that we will develop in NeuroManager will be Image Content Analysis for Retrieval Using Semantics (ICARUS), a novel, intelligent neuroimage curation system that will enable image retrieval based on visual appearance or by semantic concept. ICARUS will use machine learning applied to content-based image retrieval (CBIR) to build and refine models that summarize microscopic and macroscopic image appearance and automatically assign semantic concepts to neuroimages. Neuroscience research generates extensive, multifaceted data that is considerably under-utilized because access to original raw data is typically maintained by the source lab. On the other hand, there are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results. Unfortunately, none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists. To solve this problem, NeuroManager will include the following distinct, significant innovations: (i) versatility for handling two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional neuroimaging data sets from animal models and humans; (ii) functionality to share complex datasets that extends secure, privacy-controlled paradigms from institutional, laboratory-based and even public domains; (iii) flexibility to implement NeuroManager within an institute’s IT infrastructure, or on most cloud-based virtualized environments including Azure, Google Cloud Services and Amazon Web Services; (iv) and most importantly, the ICARUS technology for CBIR in neuroimaging data sets. The benefit of NeuroManager for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be to foster collaboration between scientists and institutions, promoting innovation through combined expertise in an interdisciplinary atmosphere. This will open new horizons for better understanding the neuropathology associated with several human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions at various levels (i.e., macroscopically, microscopically, subcellularly and functionally), ultimately leading to an improved basis for developing novel treatment and prevention strategies for complex brain diseases. In Phase I we will prove feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype software that will perform CBIR on 2D whole slide images of coronal sections of entire mouse brains from ongoing research projects of our collaborators. Work in Phase II will focus on developing the commercial software product that will include all of the innovations mentioned above. A competing technology with comparable functionality, addressing the full breadth of needs for modern neuroscience research, is currently not available commercially or otherwise.

"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia",9519804,R01AG053949,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Harvest', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevention approach', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Saliva', 'Scanning', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Site', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'aging brain', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk minimization', 'sex', 'software development', 'sound', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIA,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,410000,-0.081890678665325
"Development of label-free computational flow cytometry for high-throughput micro-organism classification The purpose of flow cytometers is to enable the classification of cells or organisms at high throughput. Label-free optical flow cytometers not based on fluorescence are generally based on scattering. The most common of these compares the amount of forward (FS) versus side (SS) scattering. Such two-parameter information permits rudimentary classification based on size or granularity, but it misses more subtle features that can be critical in defining organism identity. Nevertheless, FS/SS flow cytometry remains popular, largely because of its simplicity and capacity for high throughput.  We propose to develop a label-free computational flow cytometer that preserves much of the simplicity and high-throughput capacity of FS/SS flow cytometry, but provides significantly enhanced information. Instead of characterizing organisms based on scattering direction (as does FS/SS flow cytometry), we will characterize based on scattering patterns. We will insert a reconfigurable diffractive element in the imaging optics of a flow cytometer to route user-defined basis patterns to independent detectors. The basis patterns will be optimally matched to specific sample features. The respective weights of these basis patterns will serve as signatures to identify organisms of interest. The basis patterns themselves will be determined by machine learning algorithms. Both the device and the learning algorithms will be developed from scratch.  We anticipate that our flow cytometer will be able to operate at flow rates on the order of meters per second, commensurate with state-of-the-art FS/SS flow cytometers, while providing significantly more information for improved classification capacity. While our technique should be advantageous for any label-free flow cytometry application requiring high throughput, we will test it here by demonstrating high-throughput classification of microbial communities. NARRATIVE Our goal is to improve the information extraction capacity of label-free flow cytometers, while maintaining high throughput capacity. As such, our device should have a broad range of applications.",Development of label-free computational flow cytometry for high-throughput micro-organism classification,9510096,R21GM128020,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Microbe', 'Modernization', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pupil', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'interest', 'meter', 'microbial community', 'microorganism', 'microorganism classification', 'optical imaging', 'prototype', 'recruit']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2018,239527,-0.005493843441691391
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9530668,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Disease model', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,584485,-0.027923046680459595

"An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata PROJECT ABSTRACT Biomedical investigators are generating increasing amounts of complex and diverse data. This data varies tremendously, from genome sequences through phenotypic measurements and imaging data. If researchers and data scientists can tap into this data effectively, then we can gain insights into disease mechanisms and how to tackle them. However, the main stumbling block is that it is increasingly hard to find and integrate the relevant datasets due to the lack of sufficient metadata. A researcher studying Crohn's disease may miss a crucial dataset on how certain microbial communities affect gut histology due to the lack of descriptive tags on the data. Currently, applying metadata is difficult, time-consuming and error prone due to the vast sea of confusing and overlapping standards for each datatype. Often specialized `data wranglers' are employed to apply metadata, but even these experts are hindered by lack of good tools. Here we propose to develop an intelligent agent that researchers and data wranglers can use to assist them apply metadata. The agent is based around a personalized dashboard of metadata elements that can be collected from multiple specialized portals, as well as sites such as Wikipedia. These elements can be coupled with classifiers that can be used to self-identify datasets to which they may be relevant, making the selection of appropriate vocabularies easier for researchers. We will deploy the system for a number of targeted use cases, including annotation of the National Center for Biomedical Information Bio-Samples repository, and annotation of images within the Figshare repository. Project Narrative Biomedical data is being generated at an increasing rate, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for researchers to be able to locate and effectively operate over this data, which has negative impacts on the rate of new discoveries. One solution is to attach metadata (data about data) onto all information generated in a research project, but application of metadata is currently difficult and time consuming due to the diverse range of standards on offer, typically requiring the expertise of trained data wranglers. Here we propose to develop an intelligent concept assistant that will allow researchers to generate and share sets of metadata elements relevant to their project, and will use machine learning techniques to automatically apply this to data.",An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata,9545836,U01HG009453,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Frustration', 'Genome', 'Histology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'insight', 'microbial community', 'peer', 'prospective', 'repository', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,U01,2018,569784,-0.012077838320561984
"Reproducible Analytics for Secondary Analyses of ImmPort Vaccination-Related Cytometry Data Project Summary The immunology database and analysis portal (ImmPort, http://immport.niaid.nih.gov) is the NIAID-funded public resource for data archive and dissemination from clinical trials and mechanistic research projects. Among the current 291 studies archived in ImmPort, 114 are focused on vaccine responses (91 for influenza vaccine responses), which is the largest category when organized by research focus. As the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases, development of the next-generation vaccines is faced with the bottleneck that traditional empirical design becomes ineffective to stimulate human protective immunity against HIV, RSV, CMV, and other recent major public health threats. This project will focus on three important aspects of informatics approaches to secondary analysis of ImmPort data for influenza vaccination research: a) expanding the data analytical capabilities of ImmPort and ImmPortGalaxy through adding innovative computational methods for user-friendly unsupervised identification of cell populations, b) processing and analyzing a subset of the existing human influenza vaccination study data in ImmPort to identify cell-based biomarkers using the new computational methods, and c) returning data analysis results with data analytical provenance to ImmPort for dissemination of derived data, software tools, as well as semantic assertions of the identified biomarkers. Each aspect is one specific research aim in the proposed work. The project outcome will not only demonstrate the utility of the ImmPort data archive but also generate a foundation for the Human Vaccine Project (HVP) to establish pilot programs for influenza vaccine research, which currently include Vanderbilt University Medical Center; University of California San Diego (UCSD); Scripps Research Institute; La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology; and J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). Once such computational analytical workflow is established, it can be applied to the secondary analysis of other ImmPort studies as well as to support the user-driven analytics of their own cytometry data. Each of the specific aims contains innovative methods or new applications of the existing methods. The computational method for population identification in Aim 1 is a newly developed constrained data clustering method, which combines advantages of unsupervised and supervised learning. Cutting-edge machine learning approaches including random forest will be used in Aim 2 for the identification of biomarkers across study cohorts, in addition to the traditional statistical hypothesis testing. Standardized knowledge representation to be developed in Aim 3 for cell-based biomarkers is also innovative, as semantic networks with inferring and deriving capabilities can be built based on the machine-readable knowledge assertions. The proposed work, when accomplished, will foster broader collaboration between ImmPort and the existing vaccine research consortia. It will also accelerate the deployment of up-to-date informatics software tools on ImmPortGalaxy. Project Narrative Flow cytometry (FCM) plays important roles in human influenza vaccination studies through interrogating immune cellular functions and quantifying the immune responses in different conditions. This project will extend the current data analytical capabilities of the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) through adding novel data analytical methods and software tools for user-friendly identification of cell populations from FCM data in ImmPort influenza vaccine response studies.

"A computational approach to early sepsis detection Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to improve the performance of InSight, a machine-learning- based sepsis screening system, in situations of limited training data from the target clinical site. The proposed work will make possible prospective clinical deployments to sites which are smaller or lack clinical data repositories, by significantly reducing the amount of training data necessary down to a few weeks of clinical observation. Classically, a machine-learning-based system like InSight requires complete retraining for each new clinical setting, in turn requiring a new and large collection of data from each target deployment site. We will circumvent this requirement via transfer learning techniques, which transfer knowledge acquired previously in a source clinical setting to a new, target setting. Research Questions: Which transfer learning methods and paired classification algorithms are most suitable for use with InSight, requiring minimal target-site training data while maintaining strong performance? Are these methods and algorithms robust across the several common sepsis-spectrum definitions? Prior Work: We have developed InSight using the MIMIC-III retrospective data set, on which it attains an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 for sepsis detection, and 0.74 for 4-hour early sepsis prediction. We have also conducted pilot transfer learning  ≥ experiments in a different clinical task, mortality forecasting, in which transfer learning yields a 10-fold reduction in the amount of target-site training data required to achieve AUROC 0.80. Specific Aims: Aim 1 - to implement and assess side-by-side four diverse transfer learning methods for a retrospective clinical sepsis prediction task, where the source data set is MIMIC-III and the simulated clinical target is a data set drawn from UCSF. Aim 2 - to determine which among the best methods from Aim 1 also provide robust performance when applied to two additional sepsis-spectrum gold standards. Methods: We will prepare implementations of transfer learning methods which use instance transfer, residual learning and/or feature augmentation, kernel length scale transfer, and feature transfer. We will test these methods with applicable classifiers on subsets of the UCSF set, using cross-validation and quantifying discrimination performance in terms of AUROC. The best method/classifier pairs will require no more than 30 examples of septic patients from the target set and attain AUROC superiorities of 0.05 in 0- and 4-hour pre-onset sepsis prediction/detection, relative to the best tested alternative screening systems (Aim 1). The top three pairs will then be tested for robustness to gold standard choice, using septic shock (0- and 4-hour) and SIRS-based sepsis (0-hour) gold standards; in these tests, at least one pair must again attain 0.05 margin of superiority in AUROC versus the alternative screening systems (Aim 2). Future Directions: The results of these experiments will enable InSight to be robustly deployed to diverse clinical sites, yielding high performance without the need for extensive target-site data acquisition. Narrative Clinical decision support (CDS) systems present critical information to medical professionals by examining patient data and providing relevant information. Machine learning is a powerful method for creating CDS tools, but accessing its full strength requires re-training with retrospective data from each target clinical site. We will use transfer learning techniques to dramatically reduce the amount of target-site training data required by InSight, our machine-learning-based CDS tool for sepsis prediction, and empirically evaluate several such methods on a patient data set, using three different sepsis-related gold standards.",A computational approach to early sepsis detection,9557664,R43TR002221,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collection', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Discrimination', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'performance site', 'portability', 'prospective', 'screening', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'success', 'support tools']",NCATS,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,310782,-0.009644458145518092
"Quantifying NETosis via Automated High Content Imaging Convolutional Neural Networks PROJECT SUMMARY NETosis was identified as a distinct mode of cell death in neutrophils more than a decade ago. Dysregulation of NETosis has been implicated in the etiology of human pathologies such as preeclampsia, sickle cell disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, cystic fibrosis, lupus nephritis, and coagulopathies that include cancer-associated thrombosis. The literature consistently cites the lack of a standardized methodology for quantitation of NETosis as an impediment to basic and translational research. Thus, the premise is that there is a compelling, unmet need for a standardized, quantitative and automated method for the measurement of NETosis to accelerate neutrophil and inflammation-based research and facilitate the discovery and development of therapeutic compounds. The scope of this STTR project is to develop a high-throughput image analysis and quantitation method by using high content imaging and the revolutionary technology of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the identification and quantitation of NETosis in human neutrophils. The target readout is based on the primary morphological difference between NETotic and non-NETotic nuclei--the decondensation of chromatin. This image-based quantitative method will be observer-independent and will enable robust and rapid evaluation of a large number of samples that would exceed any attempts at manual assessment. In Phase I we will complete the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Optimize and standardize the high- throughput platform for quantitation of NETosis in adherent human neutrophils. This includes standard assay optimization procedures, training the CNN to identify and quantitate NETotic neutrophil, and demonstrating that the CNN reliably distinguishes between necrosis and NETosis, whose phenotypes appear similar to the human eye. Aim 2: Validate the NETosis assay biochemically and clinically. This includes concentration-response assays with NETosis agonists, assessment of NETosis inhibitors, and evaluation of the NETotic status of Sickle Cell Disease patient samples (a disease in which aberrant NETosis has been implicated). The expected outcome of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate proof-of-concept for this automated high- throughput NETosis assay. Further, we expect to provide insight into the utility of the assay for assessment of inhibitors of NETosis as therapeutic agents. Upon completion of our Phase I aims, our Phase II program will focus on further optimizing and validating this NETosis assay and preparing it for commercialization.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Aberrant NETosis has been implicated in the etiology of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The lack of a standardized, quantitative and automated method for the measurement of NETosis is impeding basic and translational research. We have developed a high-throughput assay using convolutional neural networks to quantify NETosis in human neutrophils.

"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE Mapping effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing of different types of individual cells, understanding the func- tion and relationships between those cell types, and modeling their individual and collective function. In order to exploit human and machine intelligence, different visual interfaces will be implemented that use the CCF in support of data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, mathematical biology, and biomedical data standards to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimen- sional spatial basemap of the human body and associated data overlays that can be interactively explored online as an atlas of tissue maps. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across the human body along multiple functional contexts (e.g., systems physiology, vascular, or endocrine systems), and connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources as driven by the context or “position” on the map. The CCF and the interactive data visualizations will be multi-level and multi-scale sup- porting the exploration and communication of tissue and publication data--from single cell to whole body. In the first year, the proposed Mapping Component will run user needs analyses, compile an initial CCF using pre-existing classifications and ontologies; implement two interactive data visualizations; and evaluate the usa- bility and effectiveness of the CCF and associated visualizations in formal user studies. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an ex- tensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spa- tial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical. This project will work in close coordination with the HuBMAP consortium to help drive an ecosystem of useful resources for understanding and leveraging high- resolution human image data and to compile a human body atlas.","The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets",9687220,OT2OD026671,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Biometry', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Endocrine system', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Participant', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Services', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Vascular System', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'hackathon', 'human imaging', 'interoperability', 'member', 'systematic review', 'usability', 'vector']",OD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,OT2,2018,330000,-0.03181111993284603
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement. The technology we propose will also contribute to the sharing of predictive models in ways that meet the needs of genomic research and healthcare.",BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy,9549126,K99HG009680,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Authorization documentation', 'Award', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Databases', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fibrinogen', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Institution', 'Institutional Policy', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer science', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness research', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'open source', 'peer', 'peer networks', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'privacy protection', 'programs', 'public trust', 'success', 'trend', 'web portal', 'web services']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2018,81977,-0.013497076762975424
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data. The Reactome database and web site enable scientists, clinicians, researchers, students, and educators to find, organize, and utilize biological information to support data visualization, integration and analysis.",Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways,9451318,U41HG003751,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Applications Grants', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Readability', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'clinically significant', 'data visualization', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'novel', 'outreach', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'tool', 'web site']",NHGRI,ONTARIO INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,U41,2018,1354554,-0.0230788568519612
"Intelligent deployment of containerized bioinformatics workflows on the cloud PROJECT SUMMARY Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges of big data. Public cloud vendors provide computing as-a-utility enabling users to pay only for the resources that are actually used. In this application, we will develop methods and tools to enable biomedical researchers to optimize the costs of cloud computing when analyzing biomedical big data. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud provides computing as a utility, on-demand, to end users, enabling cloud resources to be rapidly provisioned and scaled to meet computational and performance requirements. In addition, dynamic intelligent allocation of cloud computing resources has great potential to both improve performance and reduce hosting costs. Unfortunately, determining the most cost-effective and efficient ways to deploy modules on the cloud is non- trivial, due to a plethora of cloud vendors, each providing different types of virtual machines with different capabilities, performance trade-offs, and pricing structures. In addition, modern bioinformatics workflows consist of multiple modules, applications and libraries, each with their own set of software dependencies. Software containers package binary executables and scripts into modules with their software dependencies. With containers that compartmentalize software dependencies, modules implemented as containers can be mixed and matched to create workflows that give identical results on any platform. The high degree of reproducibility and flexibility of software containers makes them ideal instruments for disseminating complex bioinformatics workflows. Our overarching goal is to deliver the latest technological advances in containers and cloud computing to a typical biomedical researcher with limited resources who works with big data. Specifically, we will develop a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface to enable biomedical researchers to build and edit containerized workflows. Most importantly, users can choose to deploy and scale selected modules in the workflow on cloud computing platforms in a transparent, yet guided fashion, to optimize cost and performance. Our aim is to provide a federated approach that leverages resources from multiple cloud vendors. We have assembled a team of interdisciplinary scientists with expertise in bioinformatics, cloud and distributed computing, and machine learning. As part of this application, we will work closely with end users who routinely generate and analyze RNA-seq data. We will illustrate how our containerized, cloud-enabled methods and tools will benefit bioinformatics analyses. Project Narrative Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenge of analyzing diverse and massive data generated to advance our understanding of health and diseases. We will develop methods and tools to build and intelligently deploy modular and cloud-enabled bioinformatics workflows. These tools will allow the biomedical community to optimize the costs associated with cloud computing and to facilitate the replication of scientific results.",Intelligent deployment of containerized bioinformatics workflows on the cloud,9422475,R01GM126019,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Case Study', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Drops', 'Drug toxicity', 'Educational Materials', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Price', 'Privatization', 'RNA analysis', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomedical scientist', 'cloud platform', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'distributed data', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrument', 'outreach', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,356646,-0.036578280655007435
"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,9478117,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical predictors', 'education research', 'graduate student', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'undergraduate student']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2018,897471,-0.011807471738220162
"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design Our Vision: We propose DeepLink, a versatile data translator that integrate multi-scale, heterogeneous, and multi-source biomedical and clinical data. The primary goal of DeepLink is to enable meaningful bidirectional translation between clinical and molecular science by closing the interoperability gap between models and knowledge at different scales. The translator will enhance clinical science with molecular insights from basic and translational research (e.g. genetic variants, protein interactions, pathway functions, and cellular organization), and enable the molecular sciences by connecting biological discoveries with their pathophysiological consequences (e.g. diseases, signs and symptoms, pharmacological effects, physiological systems). Fundamental differences in the language and semantics used to describe the models and knowledge between the clinical and molecular domains results in an interoperability gap. DeepLink will systematically and comprehensively close this gap. We will begin with the latest technology in semantic knowledge graphs to support an extensible architecture for dynamic data federation and knowledge harmonization. We will design a system for multi-scale model integration that is ontology-based and will combine model execution with prior, curated biomedical knowledge. Our design strategy will be iterative and participatory and anchored by 10 major milestones. In a series of demonstrations of DeepLink’s functions, we will address one of the major challenges facing translational science: reproducibility of biomedical research findings that are based on evolving molecular datasets. Reproducibility of analyses and replication of results are central to scientific advancement. Many landmark studies have used data that are constantly being updated, curated, and pared down over time. Our series of demonstrations projects are designed to prototype the technology required for a scalable and robust translator as well as the techniques we will use to close the interoperability gap for a specific use case. The demonstration project will, itself, will be a significant and novel contribution to science. DeepLink will be able to answer questions that are currently enigmatic. Examples include: - From clinicians: What is the comparative effectiveness of all the treatments for disease Y given a patient's genetic/metabolic/proteomic profile? What are the functional variants in cell type X that are associated with differential treatment outcomes? What metabolite perturbations in cell type Y are associated with different subtypes of disease X? - From basic science researchers: What is known about disease Y across all model organisms (even those not designed to model Y)? What are all the clinical phenotypes that result from a change in function in protein X? Which biological pathways are affected by a pathogenic variant of disease Y? What patient data are available to evaluate a molecularlyderived clinical hypothesis? Challenges and Our Approaches: DeepLink will close the interoperability gap that currently prohibits molecular discoveries from leading to clinical innovations. DeepLink will be technologically driven, addressing the challenges associated with large, heterogeneous, semantically ambiguous, continuously changing, partially overlapping, and contextually dependent data by using (1) scalable, distributed, and versioned graph stores; (2) semantic technologies such as ontologies and Linked Data; (3) network analysis quality control methods; (4) machine-learning focused data fusion methods; (5) context-aware text mining, entity recognition and relation extraction; (6) multi-scale knowledge discovery using patient and molecular data; and (7) presentation of actionable knowledge to clinicians and basic scientists via user-friendly interfaces. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9635840,OT3TR002027,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'molecular domain', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'prototype', 'text searching', 'user-friendly']",NCATS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,OT3,2018,854309,-0.024540363529119095
"Device for real-time streaming of preclinical research data into a central cloud-based platform Project Summary BehaviorCloud is a unified cloud platform where biomedical researchers can collect, analyze, and share preclinical research data – specifically behavioral and phenotype data from animal models. Traditionally researchers collect data from many disparate instruments and store data on PCs running single license software. Raw data is stored across several locations, analysis is restricted to the PC used to collect the data, and opportunities for collaboration, remote-participation, and data sharing are limited. BehaviorCloud is leveraging cloud data streaming and storage to overcome these barriers to discovery. In 2017 BehaviorCloud released a first version of the underlying cloud platform as well as BehaviorCloud Camera, an open-source “reference implementation” that demonstrates automated video tracking of animal behavior on the BehaviorCloud platform using a consumer-grade smartphone. This tool and the underlying platform are both in active use across academic and pharmaceutical labs. The aim of this Phase I SBIR application is to develop patent-pending “Bridge” technology that allows data streaming from third-party instrumentation into the central web platform. Researchers will bypass the original software and PCs associated with their instruments to control trials through their BehaviorCloud account and receive data back in real-time. BehaviorCloud will provide a public repository to aggregate all of these data and accelerate discovery by providing computational tools for large-scale meta-analysis and machine learning based predictive analytics.

"Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics Microbial population genetic research has been crucial for understanding pathogen dynamics, virulence, host specificity, and many other topics; in many cases uncovering unexpected and transformative biological processes. However, conventional population genetic analyses are limited by the quantity of sequence data from each sample. The temporal, spatial, and evolutionary resolution of techniques that rely on single gene sequences or multi-locus sequence typing are often insufficient to study biological processes on fine scales, precisely the scales at which many evolutionary and mechanistic process occur. Population genomics offers a vast quantity of sequence information for inferring evolutionary and ecological processes on very fine spatial and temporal scales, inferences that are critical to understanding and eventually controlling many infectious diseases. The promise of population genomics is tempered, however, by difficulties in isolating and preparing microbes for next-generation sequencing. We have developed the selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) technology to sequence microbial genomes from complex biological specimens without relying on labor-intensive laboratory culture, even if the focal microbial genome constitutes only a miniscule fraction of the natural sample. The primary hindrance to popular adoption of SWGA for microbial genomic studies is not its effectiveness in producing samples suitable for next-generation sequencing but in the upfront investment needed to develop an effective protocol to amplify the genome of a specific microbial species. Identifying an SWGA protocol that consistently results in selective and even amplification across the target genome is currently hindered by computationally-inefficient software that can evaluate a very limited set of the potentially effective solutions. Further, this software uses marginally-effective optimality criteria as there is currently only a limited understanding of the true criteria that result in highly-selective and even amplification of a target genome. As a result, SWGA protocol development is currently costly in both time and resources. A primary goal of the proposed research is to identify the criteria that result in optimal SWGA by analyzing next- generation sequencing data with advanced machine learning techniques. These optimality criteria will be integrated into a freely-available, computationally-efficient swga development program that will reduce the upfront investment in SWGA protocol development, thus allowing researchers to address medically- and biologically-important questions in any microbial species. In the near term, this project will also generate effective SWGA protocols for four microbial species which can be used immediately to address fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, disease progression, and emerging infectious disease dynamics. From a global disease perspective, this work is imperative as the majority of microbial species cannot easily be cultured and are in danger of becoming bystanders in the genomics revolution that is currently elucidating evolutionary processes and molecular mechanisms in cultivable microbial species. Addressing many of the major outstanding questions about pathogen evolution will require analyses of populations of microbial genomes. Although population genomic studies would provide the analytical resolution to investigate evolutionary and mechanistic processes on fine spatial and temporal scales – precisely the scales at which these processes occur – microbial population genomic research is currently hindered by the practicalities of obtaining sufficient quantities of genomes to analyze. We propose to develop an innovative, cost-effective, practical, and publically-available technology to collect sufficient quantities of microbial genomic DNA necessary for next-generation microbial genome sequencing.",Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics,9507167,R21AI137433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratory culture', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genome Sequencing', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protocol development', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2018,242837,-0.035346536146348875
"Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award.

"Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instrumentation have not been fully leveraged to upgrade the information content of metabolomics datasets obtained from stable isotope labeling studies. This is primarily due to lack of validated software tools for extracting and interpreting isotope enrichments from HRMS datasets. The overall objective of the current application is to develop tools that enable the metabolomics community to fully leverage stable isotopes to profile metabolic network dynamics. Two new tools will be implemented within the open-source OpenMS software library, which provides an infrastructure for rapid development and dissemination of mass spectrometry software. The first tool will automate tasks required for extracting isotope enrichment information from HRMS datasets, and the second tool will use this information to group ion peaks into interaction networks based on similar patterns of isotope labeling. The tools will be validated using in-house datasets derived from metabolic flux studies of animal and plant systems, as well as through feedback from the metabolomics community. The rationale for the research is that the software tools will enable metabolomics investigators to address important questions about pathway dynamics and regulation that cannot be answered without the use of stable isotopes. The first aim is to develop a software tool to automate data extraction and quantification of isotopologue distributions from HRMS datasets. The software will provide several key features not included in currently available metabolomics software: i) a graphical, interactive user interface that is appropriate for non-expert users, ii) support for native instrument file formats, iii) support for samples that are labeled with multiple stable isotopes, iv) support for tandem mass spectra, and v) support for multi-group or time-series comparisons. The second aim is to develop a companion software that applies machine learning and correlation-based algorithms to group unknown metabolites into modules and pathways based on similarities in isotope labeling. The third aim is to validate the tools through comparative analysis of stable isotope labeling in test standards and samples from animal and plant tissues, including time-series and dual-tracer experiments. A variety of collaborators and professional working groups will be engaged to test and validate the software, and the tools will be refined based on their feedback. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it will provide the advanced software capabilities required for both targeted and untargeted analysis of isotopically labeled metabolites, but in a flexible and user-friendly environment. The research is significant because it will contribute software tools that automate and standardize the data processing steps required to extract and utilize isotope enrichment information from large-scale metabolomics datasets. This work will have an important positive impact on the ability of metabolomics investigators to leverage information from stable isotopes to identify unknown metabolic interactions and quantify flux within metabolic networks. In addition, it will enable entirely new approaches to study metabolic dynamics within biological systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop novel software tools to quantify and interpret data from stable isotope labeling experiments, which can be used to uncover relationships between metabolites and biochemical pathways. These tools have potential to accelerate progress toward identifying the causes and cures of many important diseases that impact metabolism.",Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets,9589711,U01CA235508,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ions', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'stable isotope', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'working group']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,439996,-0.007051846526749243

"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals). Project Narrative Biological assays are the foundation for developing drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolu- tionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that assays are written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized descriptions readable by computers. This lack of machine-readable annotations is a major impediment to manage, find, compare, re-use, and learn from the millions of assays.

"Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance SUMMARY:  The goal of this proposal is to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the Spinach-based splice sensor platform by developing a novel multiprobe (MP) assay design and a companion machine learning-based classification algorithm called assay classifier engine (ACE). Improvement in sensitivity and specificity of the splice sensor platform enables its application to detect endogenous RNA isoforms with low copy number and distinguish alternative RNA isoforms that share high degree of sequence similarities.  The aim of any assay development effort is to achieve excellent assay specificity and sensitivity. However, this is often a futile endeavor since specificity and sensitivity are two inversely correlated factors. The underlying reason for poor sensitivity or specificity is due to the off-target signals generated by competing molecules present in the sample. In the field of diagnostics, one of the ways these issues are addressed is to perform multiple single probe testing instead of one single probe testing. While individual singe probe assays might have poor specificity and sensitivity, when combined, these assays synergistically improve the sensitivity and specificity of the ultimate diagnostic determination. In the field of research and drug discovery, researchers have employed a multitude of strategies (e.g. signal amplification, reaction cascades, or sample enrichment) to improve sensitivity and MP design or strand displacement strategies to improve specificity. Some of the PCR- based methods have combined both enzyme-based signal amplification and MP strategies to improve assay determination. However, when it comes to detecting targets that are highly similar to their competitors, such as detecting single nucleotide polymorphism, DNA methylation, RNA modification and alternative splicing, there is still an unmet need for more sensitive and specific analytical methods.  In the past few years, Lucerna has developed Spinach-based sensors to detect intractable metabolites and biomolecules. One such sensor is the splice sensor, which is a Spinach-based sensor that can generate fluorescence signal based on the alternative RNA isoform of interest. One of the challenges encountered during splice sensor assay development is the lack of sensitivity toward low copy number RNA isoforms and low specificity when distinguishing two splice isoforms that share a high sequence similarity. To overcome this challenge in this proposal, we will develop a MP assay panel comprised of splice sensor variants that recognize the target RNA and the competitor with varying binding affinities and differing signal responses. We will use data sets generated from the MP assay to train a ML-based ACE algorithm to make target determination in test samples. Further, we will develop a quantitative MP data set and re-train the ACE algorithm to classify the assay signals into various categories based on target concentrations in the test sample. This new ACE algorithm will then be tested against conventional single probe assays to determine specificity and sensitivity improvement of the MP assay platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Improved specificity and sensitivity are highly sought-after features in assays where there are high similarity between the target and its competitors or when the target exists naturally in very low abundance. To address this unmet need, we will develop a fluorescence sensor-based multiprobe assay approach and a companion machine learning-based assay classifier engine (ACE). The ACE algorithm will integrate the multiprobe assay data and classify them based on trained machine learning models to make sample determination with enhanced specificity, sensitivity, and dynamic range than possible with conventional single probe assays.",Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance,9622514,R43GM130258,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area Under Curve', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Companions', 'Custom', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'Spinach - dietary', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'aptamer', 'assay development', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'sensor', 'targeted biomarker']",NIGMS,"LUCERNA, INC.",R43,2018,224925,-0.023151840533322404
"Multiplexed high-content assay for toxicity profiling using live iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines with lineage-specific barcoding Project Summary/Abstract Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are poised to transform toxicological evaluation, however new approaches to enable their functional and structural profiling are needed to improve the utility of hiPSC -based models for predictive and mechanistic toxicology screening. This need is addressed by our project’s Specific Aims that encompass (1) development of a novel platform for generation of hiPSC-derived reporter cells; (2) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; and (3) implementation and validation of a pilot machine learning-enabled predictive cardiotoxicity screen using these tools. The proposed tools are configured to be extensible to other toxicology- relevant pathways and phenotypes making it uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing commercial need for high-throughput predictive toxicology assays. The project deliverables benefit public health by improving the ability to rapidly identify liabilities in specific cardiomyocyte lineage types, thus reducing the time and cost to pinpoint cardiotoxicity of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. Project Narrative The assay and reagents established in the course of this project directly address the goals of significant initiatives to improve the effectiveness of cardiotoxicity testing, such as the FDA’s CiPA initiative and the work of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. The resulting improvements in the pace and precision of drug testing will result in public health benefit through the development of more cost-effective and safer medicines.

"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9472335,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,418408,-0.013114022665932352
"An automated pipeline for macromolecular structure discovery in cellular  electron cryo-tomography SUMMARY – OVERALL Cellular cryo-tomography has emerged as a critical tool for the visualization and structural study of the molecular nanomachines at the heart of cellular function. Although the basic electron cryo-tomography technique has been used for several decades, the technology is being revolutionized by recent advances in sample preparation, electron cryo-microscopy hardware, improved capabilities for automatic data collection, direct electron detection imaging devices, and phase plate technologies. Combined, these advances led to the ability to generate extraordinarily large numbers of cellular cryo-tomograms of exquisite quality. In principle, such large data sets offer insights into cellular variation in disease states as well as better insights into basic cellular function, opening new possibilities for studying the underpinnings of health and disease at the finest possible level, potentially leading to completely new diagnostics for cancer and other cell-altering diseases. However, collection of cellular data is now at a far faster rate than can currently be analyzed with existing methods, producing a serious barrier to progress: to match the data production rates of a single laboratory, at least 50 experienced scientists would need to handle the data analysis. The primary goal of this Program Project is to establish quantitative and highly automated tools for the reconstruction and interpretation of highly complex cellular tomographic data. We have assembled a highly synergistic team of PIs with complimentary expertise in cutting-edge computational and experimental electron microscopy techniques to achieve this goal through collaborative efforts. Project 1 (Hanein & Penczek) focuses on development and implementation of tomogram quality assessment and validation techniques and on experimentally guided optimization of data collection strategies. Project 2 focuses on automatic tomographic reconstruction technology, extraction of various features from the tomograms, and the analysis of distribution patterns derived from the extracted features. Project 3 focuses on development of quantitative tools for tomogram annotation through deep learning and sub-tomogram alignment as well as interactive visualization tools. The set of highly automated tools developed in this Program Project will permit us to interpret 5–10x as much data as is possible using existing methods, greatly expanding the types of cellular variations we can effectively study.

Two of these meetings, Optical Tomography and Spectroscopy (OTS) and Microscopy, Histopathology and Analytics (Microscopy) provide broad exposure to a very active multidisciplinary field in biomedical imaging and bioengineering focused on illness treatment and health enhancement. The interdisciplinary nature of the co- located meetings will provide cross-fertilization of concepts and techniques between fields with the resulting synergies obtained from such interactions. This proposal is to provide registration and travel support for students and early career professionals presenting at one of these topical meetings.  OTS will focus on new developments in diffuse optics, spectroscopy and other non- invasive tomographic imaging approaches, including the fields of diffuse optical tomography (DOT), photoacoustic tomography (PAT), optical coherence tomography (OCT), wavefront engineering to overcome scattering, as well as new developments in spectroscopic technologies.  Microscopy will include topics central to the development of optical microscopy and in vitro optical sensing for the clinic. Areas such as novel optical approaches, including computational optics, new image processing and segmentation techniques, development of decision-assistance algorithms via machine-learning and other strategies, testing technologies in pre-clinical models, applications to clinical samples, and validation in the clinic will be discussed. Optically enabled microfluidics are included in this track as well. The goal of these efforts should be towards clinical translation.  The general purpose of these meetings is to create an inclusive, open forum for the presentation of high-quality scientific research through plenary and technical sessions, short courses, panels, networking and special events. This method of face-to-face information sharing allows researchers to learn what others in their field and related disciplines are doing and to efficiently learn about new research, tools, and techniques that might be relevant to their work.

"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,9639469,R01GM130668,"['Area', 'Assimilations', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Brazil', 'Burn injury', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dengue', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'Zika Virus', 'base', 'chikungunya', 'climate variability', 'computer infrastructure', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'flu', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social media', 'socioeconomics', 'spreading factor', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,407175,-0.00444382478657683
"mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment Project Summary NIH is increasing its investment in large mutli-center brain MRI studies via projects such as the recently announced BRAIN initiative. The success of these studies depends on the quality of MRIs and the resulting image measurements, regardless of sample size. Even though quality control of MRIs and corresponding measurements could be outsourced, most neuroscience studies rely on in-house procedures that combine automatically generated scores with manually guided checks, such as visual inspection. Implementing these procedures typically requires combining several open-source software systems. For example, the NIH NIAAA and BD2K funded Data Analysis Resource (DAR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) uses XNAT to consolidate the structural, diffusion, and functional MRIs acquired across five sites, and has also developed their own custom software package to comply with study requirements that called for a multi-tier, quality control (QC) workflow. However, these custom, one-off tools lack support for multi-site QC workflows as that would require a unified platform, design that supports collaboration and sharing, and strong cohesion between technologies. To improve the effectiveness of QC efforts specific to multi-center neuroimaging studies, we will develop a widely accessible and broadly compatible software platform that supports simplified creation of custom QC workflows in compliance with study requirements, provides core functionality for performing QC of medical images, and automatically generates documentation compliant with the FAIR principle, i.e., making scientific findings findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  Specifically, our multi-site open-source software platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (mIQa) will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by leveraging open-source, state-of-the-art web interface technologies, such as a web-based dataset caching system, machine learning to aid in QC process, and an interactive electronic notebook platform. Users will be able to configure workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of medical imaging studies but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans. Issue tracking technology will enhance communication between geographically-distributed team members, as they can easily share image annotations and receive automating notifications of outstanding QC issues. The system will be easy to deploy as it will be able to interface with various imaging storage backends, such as local file systems and XNAT. While parts of this functionality have been developed elsewhere, mIQa is unique as it provides a unified, standard interface for efficient QC setup, maintenance, and review for projects analyzing multiple, independently managed data sources.  The usefulness of this unique QC system will be demonstrated on increasing the efficiency of the diverse QC team of the multi-center NCANDA study. Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop multi-site, open-source software for Medical Image Quality Assurance (mIQa) to address the QC needs of geographically diverse teams using small and large medical image-based studies alike. mIQa will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by levering open-source, state-of-the-art machine learning, data management, and web interface technologies. Our effort will minimize the time spent on labor-intensive review and analysis operations by supporting team-oriented reviewing that is guided by highly customizable workflows seamlessly interacting with existing data management systems.",mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment,9622218,R43MH119022,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Alcohols', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Four-dimensional', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'International', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Writing', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'data access', 'data management', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image archival system', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'open source', 'operation', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'research study', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'web interface', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R43,2018,225001,-6.183368392379103e-05
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems. The results of our fundamental research will be new computer codes for modeling macromolecular assemblies, the structures of which facilitate the prediction of medically relevant functions.",Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy,9517061,R01GM062968,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Filaments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Filament', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hair Cells', 'Health', 'Hydration status', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Motors', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Plant Resins', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tomogram', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'computer code', 'cryogenics', 'data warehouse', 'density', 'design', 'fiber cell', 'fitness', 'fundamental research', 'high standard', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'macromolecular assembly', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tomography', 'tool']",NIGMS,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,306284,-0.032162212586451445

"The Blackfynn Platform for Rapid Data Integration and Collaboration Summary One in seven people worldwide suffers from a brain disorder, e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's, stroke, or dementia. Development of future treatments depends on improving our understanding of brain function and disease, and validating new treatments critically depends on identifying the underlying biomarkers associated with different conditions. Biomarker discovery requires volume, quality, richness, and diversity of data. This Direct-to-Phase II project extends Blackfynn's cloud data management platform for team science, in order to support interactive data curation and integration and to facilitate biomarker discovery. Our first technical aim develops tools to help select, curate, assess, and regularize datasets: we develop novel “live” query capabilities to ensure users discover relevant data, develop mechanisms for using data's provenance to decide on trustworthiness, and build tools for mapping fields to common data elements. These capabilities address the critical, under-served problem of selecting the data to analyze. Our second technical aim develops techniques for incorporating algorithms to link and co-register across multi-modal data and metadata. Using ranking and machine learning, we can incorporate and combine state-of-the-art algorithms for finding data relationships, and we can link to remote data sources. These capabilities enable scientists to analyze richer datasets with multiple data modalities and properties – thus enabling them to discover more complex correlations and biomarkers. In our third aim, Blackfynn's new technical capabilities will be applied to challenges faced by Blackfynn partners, including problems assessing trustworthiness of data annotations, conducting image analysis, modeling epileptic networks, and identifying biomarkers for neuro-oncology indications. As part of this validation we will also develop HIPAA-compliant mechanisms for working with protected and de-identified data together. Together, these three thrusts will ensure that development of the Blackfynn platform results in tools and technologies that meaningfully accelerate scientific understanding and discovery over rich and complex data, leading to improved treatments for neurologic disease.   Narrative This Direct-to-Phase II project extends the Blackfynn cloud data management platform to enable biomarker discovery for research and development of improved drugs, devices and clinical care for patients with neurologic disease: it develops tools for assembling, evaluating, and rating data, and linking it across modalities and to external systems.

"An integrated neural network analysis and video microscopy platform for fully automated particle tracking Project Summary/Abstract  Particle tracking (PT) is a biophysical tool for elucidating molecular interactions, transport phenomena of diverse species, and rheological properties of complex materials. PT experiments involve first obtaining high resolution videos that capture time-resolved increments of particles, followed by extraction of traces of entities of interest from videos in the form of spatial locations over time, a process we refer to as path conversion. Finally, quantitative analysis of the traces will yield diffusivities, viscoelasticity, etc.  Lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and COPD, are characterized by a highly viscoelastic mucus layer that is incapable of being cleared by mucociliary clearance. Not surprisingly, the viscoelasticity of mucus often directly reflects disease progression. A variety of mucolytics are being investigated, but due to the variable composition and properties of mucus between patients, effective mucolytics treatment will likely be different between individuals; too little/inappropriate mucolytics will not be effective in restoring mucus clearance, whereas too much may result in bronchorrhea. Although microbeads-based rheology has been performed on a variety of mucus specimens in basic research, the capacity for high throughput characterization of rheological properties of biological specimens in a clinical setting is currently not available. This limitation can be attributed to inefficiencies of path conversion: current PT software requires extensive human supervision/intervention to achieve accurate path conversion, not only resulting in poor reproducibility and throughput but also restricting its use to only expert labs. Our vision is to make PT as objective and easy to use as a simple plate reader that can be readily utilized by clinicians (diagnostics, disease progression, therapy effectiveness), pharma (preclinical/clinical drug screening), and research professionals. Towards this goal, we have created a neural network tracker (NNT) that automatically determines the location of all particles in each frame with zero user-input (i.e. no parameter for users to change), and retains the identity of all particles from frame to frame. The innovation is that NNT can robustly, reproducibly, and accurately track a wide range of 2D/3D videos with virtually no need for human intervention, achieving unparalleled time savings. We have already successfully deployed NNT over the Google cloud, which offers exceptional scalability. Nevertheless, for time-sensitive applications, such as an automated PT rheometer, the transfer of large video data files is likely prohibitive. Therefore, in this Phase I STTR, we seek to enable real-time NNT-based PT analysis on the local machine while video microscopy data is being acquired by the microscope, and allow data from PT analysis to drive the operation of the microscope. In Aim 1, we will integrate our NNT with a single objective fluorescence microscope system called Monoptes. Aim 2 will evaluate the performance of our NNT- Monoptes system. If successful, our technology would form the basis of a fully automated PT system capable of measuring rheological properties of fluids/materials or distribution of particle sizes in a 96-well plate format. Project Narrative Particle tracking is a powerful biophysical tool in life and physical sciences, but unfortunately, its application has been strongly limited by inefficiencies in accurately extracting particle traces from raw movies. Unlike conventional particle tracking methods, we have combined artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a software that can consistently provide superior and truly automated tracking performance compared to current alternatives. In this proposal, we will integrate this latest advance with sophisticated instrumentation to develop a microscope system capable of fully automated particle tracking microscopy in a 96-well plate format.

"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9535994,R01EB021396,"['Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'clinical translation', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2018,444363,-0.01330857296946699
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections. Validating the molecular targets of these compounds for in vivo nerve growth will enable future drug discovery projects focused on these targets.",Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury,9515069,R01NS100531,"['Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Complement 5a', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Control Animal', 'Contusions', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Failure', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery of Function', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Viral Vector', 'Walking', 'axon growth', 'axon regeneration', 'behavior test', 'behavioral outcome', 'central nervous system injury', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injured', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'light microscopy', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'targeted agent', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,465464,-0.02945061209250267
"Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research PROJECT SUMMARY This Phase II project aims to continue development of a commercial quality, innovative cloud hosted information management system, called Climb 2.0™ that will increase laboratory efficiency and provide improved capabilities for research laboratories. Climb is designed to offer integrated laboratory process management modules that include mobile communications tools data monitoring and alert systems, and integrated access to Microsoft Azure Cloud™ Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services. Initially, Climb 2.0 will target animal model research laboratories; however, the core of the platform is designed to be adaptable to nearly any research type or related industry. Current research information management systems are primarily designed as record-keeping tools with little or no direct focus on laboratory efficiency or in enhancing value of the research data. They also do not leverage emergent mobile device technologies, social media frameworks, and data analysis and storage capabilities of cloud computing. Many laboratories still use paper as their primary recording system. Paper data logging is then followed by secondary data entry into a laboratory database. These systems are error prone, time consuming and lead to laboratory databases with significant time lags between data acquisition and data entry. Moreover, they do not recognized cumulative data relationships, which may identify important trends, and researchers often miss windows of opportunity to take action on time-sensitive events. In Phase I, RockStep Solutions demonstrated feasibility of an innovative Cloud Information Management Bundle system, Climb, which will increase efficiency and improve capabilities in animal model data management. During Phase I, a beta version of Climb was successfully developed and tested against strict performance metrics as a proof of concept. We successfully built a prototype with working interfaces that integrates real-time communication technologies with media capabilities of mobile devices. Phase II proposes four specific Aims: 1) Develop the technology infrastructure to support the secure and scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of Climb for enterprise commercial release; 2) Develop and extend the Phase-I prototype Data Monitoring and Messaging System (DMMS) into a platform ready for production use; 3) Extend Climb’s DMMS adding a Stream Analytics engine to support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and streaming media; 4) Deploy a beta release of Climb at partner research labs, test and refine the product for final commercialization. To ensure Climb is developed with functionality and tools relevant to research organizations, RockStep Solutions has established collaborations with key beta sites to test all of the major functionality developed in this proposal. IMPACT: By leveraging emergent technologies and cloud computing, Climb offers several advantages: 1) enables real-time communications using familiar tools among members of research groups; 2) reduces the risk of experimental setbacks, and 3) enables complex experiments to be conducted efficiently. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Invests approximately $12 billion each year in animal model research that is central to both understanding basic biological processes and for developing applications directly related to improving human health. More cost-effective husbandry and colony management techniques, equipment, and new approaches to improve laboratory animal welfare and assure efficient and appropriate research use (e.g., through cost savings and reduced animal burden) are high priorities for NIH. RockStep Solutions proposes to meet this need by integrating existing and emergent software and communication technologies to create a novel solution, Climb 2.0, for research animal data management. Climb 2.0 extracts immediate value of data in animal research laboratories and extends the database into a multimedia communication network, thus enabling science that would be impractical to conduct with traditional methods.",Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research,9741597,R44GM112206,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communications Media', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Information Management', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multimedia', 'Notification', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'design', 'encryption', 'experimental study', 'good laboratory practice', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'service learning', 'social media', 'software as a service', 'success', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"ROCKSTEP SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2018,99999,-0.013724553234053468
"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program.

"Towards a FAIR Digital Ecosystem in the Cloud Cloud Computing, Big Data Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence are transforming biomedical research. The NIH Data Commons will provide a common, cloud-agnostic, harmonized environment where these technologies can be deployed to serve NIH intra- and extra-mural researchers, implementing FAIR principles [Wilkinson2016]. Our proposal provides two essential capabilities: (1) Global Unique Identification (GUIDs) and (2) Digital Object Publication, Citation, Replication and Reuse. We propose a FAIR biomedical ecosystem where all primary and derived digital objects (e.g., datasets, software) receive GUIDs, assisting with Findability and Accessibility, Reusability, data provenance, reproducibility, and accountability of research outcomes. GUIDs will provide full Interoperability between DOIs and prefix: accession based Compact Identifiers through a common resolution services prefix registry. All digital objects will interoperate with multiple, hybrid clouds—open source and commercial—enabling researchers to select computing resources best matching their needs. 1 - The Global Unique Identifier (GUID) Capability provides a persistent, machine resolvable identifier platform for all FAIR objects in the Commons, fully aligned with community practices, recommendations, and metadata models. 2 - The Cloud Dataverse for Biomedical Digital Object Publication, Citation, Replication, and Reuse applies FAIR principles to primary and derived datasets, computational provenance, and software, making them fully FAIR compliant, while documenting the production processes. Cloud Dataverse integrates with multiple cloud computing solutions. As an example, with these capabilities, a researcher can extract a subset of data from TOPMed or GTEx and publish it in Cloud Dataverse, with its associated metadata, provenance, and terms of use. In publications, she can cite the data and software according to Data Citation Publishers guidelines [Cousijn2017] and Software Citation Principles [Smith2016]. Other researchers can access the dataset using the GUID in the citation, resolving the repository’s dataset landing page (as recommended by the Data Citation Principles [Martone2014, Fenner2017, Starr2015]). From this landing page, researchers can repeat the original calculation, perform new computations on the dataset, or use the provenance graph to learn how the dataset was created. The data and software published in the repository reflect the evolving nature of research; anyone can publish new versions with the provenance documenting the process. Our open-source software platforms used in production, adhere to FAIR principles, and provide the basis for the two capabilities: GUIDs and Cloud Dataverse enabling the use cases above.

"Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroscience is producing increasingly complex data sets, including measures and manipulations of sub- cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular mechanisms operating over multiple timescales and in the context of different behaviors and task conditions. These data sets pose several fundamental challenges. First, for a given data set, what are the relevant spatial, temporal, and computational scales in which the underlying information-processing dynamics are best understood? Second, what are the best ways to design and select models to account for these dynamics, given the inevitably limited, noisy, and uneven spatial and temporal sampling used to collect the data? Third, what can increasingly complex data sets, collected under increasingly complex conditions, tells us about how the brain itself processes complex information? The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate new, theoretically grounded methods to help researchers to overcome these challenges. Our primary hypothesis is that resolving, modeling, and interpreting relevant information- processing dynamics from complex data sets depends critically on approaches that are built upon understanding the notion of complexity itself. A key insight driving this proposal is that definitions of complexity that come from different fields, and often with different interpretations, in fact have a common mathematical foundation. This common foundation implies that different approaches, from direct analyses of empirical data to model fitting, can extract statistical features related to computational complexity that can be compared directly to each other and interpreted in the context of ideal-observer benchmarks. Starting with this idea, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish a common theoretical foundation for analyzing both data and model complexity; 2) develop practical, complexity-based tools for data analysis and model selection; and 3) establish the usefulness of complexity-based metrics for understanding how the brain processes complex information.

"Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to extend its innovative software platform — BioAssay Express (BAE, version 1.0) — which helps biologists to quickly and easily encode their plain-text biological assay protocols into formats suitable for computational processing. In Phase 2B, CDD will further enhance BAE so that it can markup a bioassay with a comprehensive, detailed set of annotations that completely specifies the protocol, step by step. In its current state of development in Phase 2, BAE 1.0 enables scientists to summarize the English language text that specifies an experimental protocol, supplementing it with machine-interpretable descriptors. At the end of Phase 2B, BAE 2.0 will output a detailed machine- interpretable version that will be completely equivalent to, and can optionally substitute for, the traditional English language method description. The enhanced BAE 2.0 software will enable scientists engaged in early stage drug discovery to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures and intelligently aggregate datasets across research groups. An important benefit will be facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility by (1) flagging differences between closely related assays; (2) correlating differences in protocols with differences in results; and (3) improving the reproducibility of experiments conducted in different laboratories, to highlight potential causes of divergences. The project will continue to leverage the related broad initiatives at NIH and elsewhere that are working to promote translational research, gather screening data via open repositories, and apply sophisticated ontologies to classify these datasets. Our project targets the intersection of these disparate initiatives and unifies them by making their complex standards and guidelines for praxis realistically accessible to researchers who want to focus on their scientific work To encourage adoption, the software will prioritize intuitive ease of use by scientists who are not informatics experts, harmonize with existing laboratory workflows, minimize the extra effort of annotation, integrate seamlessly into preclinical data management platforms (including but not limited to CDD’s own CDD Vault), and deliver clear and immediate benefits to the user as part of an integrated experience. This combination of new capabilities and extreme ease of use will accelerate translational drug discovery efforts by empowering software platforms that bridge the divide between biologists and medicinal chemists to apply sophisticated tools — long available on the chemistry side — for the first time also to the biological side, and thus across both domains. Existing software can already easily connect screening results to chemical structures. This new platform will further connect these data to the purpose and methodology of the screens. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures, thereby facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility of data and assays. This fundamental capability ultimately accelerates translating new experimental discoveries into the development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. These tools will particularly benefit networks of researchers working on diseases that leading pharmaceutical companies have largely ignored because they are not perceived as highly profitable opportunities, despite the fact that in many cases they afflict millions of people.",Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery,9464228,R44TR000185,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'English Language', 'Ensure', 'Experimental Designs', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Screening Result', 'Semantics', 'Side', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biomedical ontology', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'drug discovery', 'empowered', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2018,744321,-0.033146699140927126
"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9593457,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,276802,-0.029658114112879646
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9503015,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mechanical properties', 'microvesicles', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2018,664486,-0.016458896120070985
"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice. There is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour organs at risk in medical images at a high degree of automation for impacting current practice of radiation therapy planning. Encouraged by strong competitive results from the Phase I part of this project, in this grant, further technical advances and a cloud-based software service are proposed. A multicenter clinical evaluation of the new product is also planned to assess the clinical efficacy of the system.",Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning,9622047,R42CA199735,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blinded', 'Body Regions', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Personnel', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Object Attachment', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Service delivery model', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'software as a service', 'software development', 'software systems', 'treatment center', 'treatment planning', 'virtual']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R42,2018,1057846,-0.008249853468027238
"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data.

"Acceleration techniques for SimSET SPECT simulations Abstract The Simulation System for Emission Tomography (SimSET) is one of the foundational tools for emission tomography research, used by hundreds of researchers worldwide for both positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). It has proven to be accurate and efficient for both PET and low energy SPECT studies; because SimSET uses a geometric model for its SPECT collimation, it is less accurate for high energy isotopes. This application proposes to address this with the use of angular response functions (ARFs), a technique that has proven to accurately model SPECT collimation and detection for high-energy isotopes more efficiently than full photon-tracking simulations. In addition, we propose a novel ARF-based importance sampling method that will speed these simulations by a factor of >50. The generation of ARF tables is another consideration: it is extremely compute intensive and has caused ARF to be used only when a large number of simulations are needed using the same isotope/collimator/detector combination. For this reason, we also propose application of importance sampling to speed the generation of ARF tables by a factor 5, and the creation of a library of angular response functions for popular isotope/collimator/detector combinations. The former will lessen the computational cost of generating the tables, the latter will, for many users/uses, eliminate the need to generate ARF tables at all. This will greatly expand the potential applications of ARF-based simulations. Our first aim is to accelerate SimSET SPECT simulations without sacrificing accuracy. This will be accomplished by synergistically utilizing two tools: variance reduction and angular response function (ARF) tables. Variance reduction includes importance sampling and forced detection. We hypothesis that these techniques combined with information from our angular response function tables will improve SimSET simulation efficiency by >50 times of SPECT simulations of specific radioisotopes (e.g., I-123, Y-90, etc.). Our second aim is to accelerate ARF table generation. This will be accomplished by using importance sampling methods in the generation of ARFs. We further propose to use an adaptive stratification scheme that will simulate photons for a given table position only as long as required to determine its value to a user-specified precision. Our third aim is to create a library of pre-calculated ARF tables for popular vendor isotope/collimator/detector configurations. These ARF tables will then be made publically available for download through the SimSET website. With a registered user base of >500, we believe that these enhancements to SimSET will have far reaching impact on research projects throughout the world. Narrative The overall goal of this work is to develop methods to speed up the SimSET Monte Carlo-based simulation software for single photon computed tomography (SPECT) imaging systems by greater than 50-fold. This type of speed up with enable new research that was previously impractical due to the computation time required for simulation. In addition, all software tools and tables developed within this project will be made available via a web-based host.",Acceleration techniques for SimSET SPECT simulations,9583854,R03EB026800,"['90Y', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Collimator', 'Communities', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Industrialization', 'Institution', 'Isotopes', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Photons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radioisotopes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vendor', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cost', 'detector', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'response', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'synergism', 'thallium-doped sodium iodide', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R03,2018,74515,-0.0008686689223270458

"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers.

"Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST) Antibiotic resistance is compromising our ability to treat bacterial infections. Clinical microbiology laboratories guide appropriate treatment through antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of patient bacterial isolates. However, increasingly, pathogens are developing resistance to a broad range of antimicrobials, requiring AST of less commonly used or recently introduced agents for which no commercially available or FDA-cleared testing methods exist. Agar and broth dilution are gold standard methods for AST that can be used to test any antimicrobial; however, labor and technical complexity precludes their use in hospital-based clinical laboratories. Therefore, bacterial isolates often must be sent to a reference laboratory with a 4-6 day delay in results. Furthermore, even standard methods require overnight incubation prior to readout. Therefore, there exists a significant AST testing gap in which current methodologies cannot adequately address the need for rapid results in the face of unpredictable susceptibility profiles. Our laboratory has recently verified inkjet printer-based digital dispensing technology as a novel platform to facilely perform reference AST for any antimicrobial at will. In this proposal, we aim to combine this methodology with advanced microscopy to leapfrog traditional AST capabilities through: (1) development of a method for microscopic imaging of bacterial replication on a solid-phase, 384-well microplate AST format, thereby allowing determination of susceptibility for any drug at will in 4 hours and (2) development and application of advanced image analysis for automated susceptibility calls. This new platform is designated MAST for microscopy-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The clinical diagnostic performance of the platform will be optimized against an AST reference method for accuracy and precision using a large panel of well-characterized clinical isolates. We anticipate establishing a prototype platform that will address the AST testing gap and thereby help our health system more effectively address the antimicrobial resistance threat. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, it is no longer possible to accurately predict which antimicrobials will be effective against life-threatening bacterial illness. Testing bacteria directly for response available therapies may take several days. Therefore, a new technology platform called MAST is proposed to allow us to determine which antibiotics can treat a bacteria infection in a matter of hours and thereby address our current, clinically unacceptable antimicrobial testing gap.",Microscopy-Based Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MAST),9455026,R21AI130434,"['Address', 'Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Nutrient', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Printing', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Solid', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'clinical diagnostics', 'digital', 'direct application', 'microscopic imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prototype', 'response']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2018,263805,-0.02467516124155434
"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data Project Summary/Abstract  The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the data as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community be- comes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2). The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates a dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informat- ics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an inde- pendent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented stor- age vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and pri- vacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix fac- torization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. 4 Project Narrative  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don’t have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this ‘missing data’ and allow for pooling of both open and ‘closed’ repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed compu- tational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms. 3","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",9717051,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'commune', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2018,282320,0.006833830684671584
"A Systems Biology Approach to Investigate the Structure Changes of Biological Network Project Summary/Abstract Networks have been widely used to describe many biological processes. Understanding the structure of biological network, especially regulatory network, will provide a key to discovering the mechanisms underlying important biological processes and pathogenesis of diseases. One of the most challenging tasks in systems biology is how to correctly reconstruct the networks from the high-dimensional data generated by modern genomic technology. Most network inference methods assume the network structure is time-invariant. Some recent studies revealed the structures of some biological networks are non-stationary or time-varying. For example, the neural information flow networks of brains are changing during learning process. Importantly, cancer studies found the native T cells would be converted into senescent T cells due to the structure changes of genetic network during tumorigenesis. The stationary network inference methods can't be used to reconstruct the time-varying network. Non-stationary network inference methods are urgently needed to investigate the time-varying networks at different stages. Some researchers have attempted to develop some time-varying network inference methods. However, the inferred networks using existing methods are only correlation or causality graphs, not regulatory networks which require activation & inhibition information. This project aims to develop novel non-stationary network inference methods to reconstruct time-varying regulatory networks from time series data. Since the networks are highly complex, it is not realistic to manually verify large networks as being used by the traditional methods. We will develop a powerful Model Checker, which is a Turing Award winning technique for hardware system verification, to intelligently verify the inferred time-varying networks. Our long-term goal is to integrate the statistical inference and model checking techniques in a unified platform to automatically reconstruct and verify time-varying networks. This integrative systems biology approach will make the large-network inference and verification automatic, intelligent and efficient. Recent cancer studies show that, restoring senescent T cells represents a promising strategy for cancer treatment. In collaboration with cancer immunologist, we will apply computational-experimental approaches to investigate what structure changes of the genetic network and how they induce T-cell's functional changes and influence its fate decision making from naive T-cells to senescent T-cells. Answering these questions will significantly improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the T cell differentiation during tumorigenesis. Public Health Relevance/Narrative This project aims to develop a novel systems biology approach to reconstruct the time-varying biological networks from high-dimensional data in collaboration with the cancer immunologist. The proposed research has relevance to public health, because it seeks to investigate what and how the structure changes of genetic network induce the T-cell's functional changes during tumorigenesis, which will ultimately improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the T cell differentiation and cancer.",A Systems Biology Approach to Investigate the Structure Changes of Biological Network,9655801,R15GM129696,"['Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Gene Structure', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Immunologist', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Muscle Development', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell differentiation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computer studies', 'exhaust', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'senescence', 'tool', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis']",NIGMS,SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY,R15,2018,454500,-0.036980785611220444
"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,9498252,R01HG010040,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Length', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Medical Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genome analysis', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'light weight', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2018,158992,-0.03306743958101426

"Hamamatsu Nanozoomer S60 Digital Whole Slide Scanner Project Summary/Abstract This application is for a shared instrumentation grant from the Light Microscope Imaging Facility at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) School of Medicine (SOM) to acquire a fully automated, high-capacity, high- resolution Hamamatsu Nanozoomer S60 slide scanner that can accommodate both brightfield and fluorescence imaging in single-slide and double-slide formats. We also request MicroDimensions 3D reconstruction and alignment software packages for manipulating and analyzing the whole slide images produced with the scanner. We need to replace a scanner that is not functioning properly. Our well-established shared core facility supports NIH-funded investigators by giving them access to state-of-the-art microscopy technologies that enhance collaborative, multidisciplinary research. Acquisition of this instrument will have a high impact on the biomedical research at CWRU and expand the scope of our NIH-funded projects. Several projects have been identified that will utilize the scanner and its associated analyses programs. These include: the genetic mechanisms underlying skin fibrosis and cranial bone development (Atit); the mechanisms behind the lifelong functions of transcription factors in axonal growth and architecture (Deneris); deep-learning for histologic image predictors of various diseases (Madabhushi); the development of diagnostic probes to discriminate between glioma subtypes for screening and survival therapies (Brady-Kalnay); the role of progesterone receptors in the control of parturition and the development of therapies to prevent preterm birth (Messiano); the mechanisms by which breast cancer stem cells overcome metastatic latency leading to disease recurrence and the biomarkers that could potentially identify those tumors likely to undergo this process (Schiemann); and the significance of cholesterol-related proteins in brain and retinal function (Pikuleva). Many additional projects of minor users and others at CWRU are anticipated. All of the proposed projects are in need of a high-capacity automated scanner acquiring whole slide images so that analyses can be applied to tissues that cover hundreds of fields of view, rather than the single regions of interest that can be acquired on a standard microscope. Narrative This proposal seeks to acquire a new, state-of-the-art high-speed, high content digital slide scanner for high resolution cellular and biomarker identfcation across large tissue areas. The dual mode (fluorescence and brightfield) allows flexibility in marker visualization while the software allows the automated alignment of whole slide images for multi-stain analysis and 3d reconstruction of serial section for in-depth analysis of specimens.

"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of “non-monotone” missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ﬂawed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ﬁxed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiﬁc domains, making “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiﬁc reporting.

"Partelligence Abstract Halo Labs proposes to develop “Partelligence” a particle ID technique that enables accurate and rapid identification of contaminating particles in biopharmaceutical formulations. Protein therapeutics currently represent between 15 and 30% of the overall pharmaceutical market. The primary concern for this class of therapeutics is that they can elicit an immune response from patients who develop anti- drug antibodies. The drug’s effect is therefore eliminated between 1 and 10 percent of patients who return to their original disease state. The presence of particulate matter in these therapeutics (e.g. shed glass from a syringe or a protein aggregate) can enhance this immune response and, due to the patient safety risk the FDA regulates the amount of particles that can be present. There are always some number of particles in each injected sample, and although their presence can be detected, they don’t know what the particles actually are. A QC tool that can identify the particles would help manufactures trace them back to their source (e.g. a bad lot of syringes) and eliminate them. Partelligence aims to make particle identification routine in biopharma QC. The technology builds off our current instrument, Horizon, which was launched in mid-2017 and already sold to some of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. The technique works by analyzing several combinatorial features including size, morphology, optical contrast, and intrinsic fluorescence, and in this proposal we will test which features are key to enable the most accurate and rapid particle recognition. To date, we have performed feasibility experiments validating our ability to identify a few commonly found particles in biopharma solutions. Given this, our goals in Phase I are to expand on these studies by building a comprehensive training set and by testing a number of different algorithms. We will first start with reference samples, and then move to real biopharmaceutical samples provided by our pharma collaborators. At the end of the study, we will do a feasibility analysis to determine if the throughput, specificity and reliability meets the needs of the industry. Narrative We propose to evaluate a particle recognition technique to enable accurate and rapid identification of unwanted contaminating particles in biopharmaceutical formulations. Successful development of this analytical technique would improve bioprocess control by identifying dangers early on in development and throughout the manufacturing process, resulting in safer protein drugs, reduced recalls and shortened time to market.",Partelligence,9679781,R43GM132995,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Alpha Particles', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Back', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Products', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fluorescence', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Formulation', 'Generations', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Regulation', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Rubber', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Syringes', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'bioprocess', 'combinatorial', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'forest', 'imaging modality', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'instrument', 'manufacturing process', 'microscopic imaging', 'particle', 'patient response', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'protein aggregate', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool', 'trend']",NIGMS,"OPTOFLUIDICS, INC.",R43,2018,203830,-0.04884213299175603
"Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs PROJECT ABSTRACT Above-knee amputees often struggle to perform the varying activities of daily life with conventional prostheses. Emerging powered knee-ankle prostheses have motors that can restore normative biomechanics, but these devices are limited to a small set of pre-defined activities that must be tuned to the user by technical experts over several hours. The overall goal of this project is to model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning. The universal use of different task-specific controllers in current powered legs is a direct consequence of the prevailing paradigm for viewing human locomotion as a discrete set of activities. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge about how to analyze, model, and control continuously varying locomotion, which greatly limits the adaptability and agility of powered prostheses. The central hypothesis of this project is that continuously varying activities can be represented by a single mathematical model based on measureable physical quantities called task variables. The proposed project will be scientifically significant to understanding how humans continuously adapt to varying activities and environments, technologically significant to the design of agile, user-synchronized powered prosthetic legs, and clinically significant to the adoption of powered knee-ankle prostheses for improved community ambulation. The proposed model of human locomotion will enable new prosthetic strategies for controlling and adapting to the environment, which aligns with the missions of the NICHD/NCMRR Devices and Technology Development program area and the NIBIB Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program. The innovation of this work is encompassed in 1) a continuous paradigm for variable locomotor activities that challenges the existing discrete paradigm, 2) a unified task control methodology that drastically improves the agility of powered prosthetic legs, and 3) a partially automated tuning process that significantly reduces the time and technical expertise required to configure powered knee- ankle prostheses. This continuous task paradigm will provide new methods and models for studying human locomotion across tasks and task transitions. This innovation will address a key roadblock in control technology that currently restricts powered legs to a small set of activities that do not generalize well across users. The adaptability of the proposed control paradigm across users and activities will transform the prosthetics field with a new generation of “plug-and-play” powered legs for community ambulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the clinical application of variable-activity powered prosthetic legs can significantly improve community mobility and therefore quality of life for nearly a million American amputees. Recently developed powered knee-ankle prostheses are limited to a small set of pre- defined activities that require several hours of expert tuning for each user. This project will model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning, which aligns with the missions of the Devices and Technology Development program area of the NICHD National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research and the Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program of the NIBIB.",Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs,9596236,R01HD094772,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'American', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Artificial Leg', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Degree program', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Environment', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Research', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Study models', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'human data', 'human model', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'orthotics', 'powered prosthesis', 'programs', 'prosthesis control', 'robot control', 'sensor', 'success', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'trend']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,R01,2018,474602,-0.013251873014032498
"Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology Project Summary Platelet transfusion is critical for severely bleeding patients and nearly 6 million units are transfused in the United States and Europe annually. In the United States, platelets are typically stored for 5 days resulting in a waste of 20% of their supply. Short storage duration is a consequence of bacterial contamination and platelet quality considerations. Though many methods have been developed for bacterial testing and pathogen inactivation, fewer have been developed for improving quality of stored platelets. Platelet additive solutions have the possibility to increase storage quality and duration, reduce plasma-related allergic reactions, impact the efficacy of pathogen reduction techniques, and save plasma which can then be used as an additional transfusion product. While the benefits are well known, there has been little progress in developing new platelet additive solutions for increasing quality and safety of platelet transfusion because there is a lack of broad understanding of biochemical and signaling changes during storage. There has been interest to utilize high-throughput metabolite profiling for global understanding of platelet metabolic decline but data analysis of complex datasets has been a daunting challenge. In Phase I of this program, we developed the first, robust computational platform involving statistical analysis and systems biology of metabolic and signaling networks to interpret and analyze PLT metabolomic and proteomic profiles in a complete network context. Using time- course global, quantitative metabolite profiling, we determined that PLTs undergo a non-linear decay process and computationally identified key metabolic enzymes and cellular process that drive this decay. Based on the computational results, we have devised two novel additive solution strategies to mitigate the decay process and improve the length of PLT units. In this Phase II proposal, we will validate the computationally determined additive solutions for efficacy in alleviating the non-linear decay process through 1) metabolomics experiments, and 2) non-metabolic PLT physiology experiments including cell activation and hemostatic effectiveness. A successful additive solution will be progressed to media refinement and preclinical testing. Project Narrative Platelet transfusion units are typically stored for five days in the United States leading to a waste of 20% of units and potential quality concerns. The field is open for innovation as most storage media technologies are derived from work from the early 1990s. This proposal will develop novel computational methods to comprehensively understand the degradation of platelets under storage conditions and experimentally validate new additive solutions for increasing platelet quality and extending shelf life, an area that accounts for $2.5 billion of hospital costs.",Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology,9506810,R44HL127843,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Europe', 'Formulation', 'Glutathione', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hospital Costs', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'State Hospitals', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supplementation', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'model design', 'novel', 'open innovation', 'oxidative damage', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'programs', 'statistics', 'success', 'time use', 'wasting']",NHLBI,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2018,428727,-0.006421401649084033
"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. ​A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image data set is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focus on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest.

"Bioinformatics Tools for Circadian Biology Circadian rhythms are fundamental for understanding biology: they date back to the origin of life, they are found in virtually every species from cyanobacteria to mammals, and they coordinate many important biological functions from the sleep-wake cycle, to metabolism, and to cognitive functions. Circadian rhythms are equally fundamental for health and medicine: modifications in diet have been linked to modification in circadian rhythms at the molecular level; disruptions of circadian rhythms have been linked to health problems ranging from depression, to learning disorders, to diabetes, to obesity, to cardiovascular disease, to cancer, and to premature ageing; finally, a large fraction of drug targets have been found to oscillate in a circadian manner in one or several tissues, suggesting that a better understanding of circadian oscillations at the molecular level could have direct applications to precision medicine, for instance by optimizing the time at which drugs are taken.

"Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases 7. Project Summary/Abstract There is an urgent need to support research that generates high-quality evidence to inform clinical decision making. Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) achieve the highest standard of evidence for the evaluation of community-level effectiveness of intervention strategies against infectious diseases. However, there is a need to develop new methods to improve the design and analysis of CRTs because unique and complicated analytical challenges arise in such settings. One such issue relates to the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the degree to which individuals within a community are more similar to one another than to individuals in other communities. Design and analysis of CRTs must take into account the ICC. Lack of accurate information on the ICC jeopardizes the power of CRTs, leads to suboptimal choices of analysis methods and complicates the interpretation of study results. However, reliable information on the ICC is difficult to obtain. A robust and efficient approach for estimating ICCs is based on the second-order generalizing estimating equations. However, its use has been limited by considerable computational burden and poor convergence rates associated with the existing algorithms solving these equations. The first aim addresses these computational challenges. Missing data are ubiquitous and can lead to bias and loss of efficiency. The second aim proposes to develop novel robust and efficient methods for estimating ICCs in the presence of informative missing data. For infectious diseases, the underlying contact/transmission networks give rise to complicated correlation structure. The third aim is to develop network and epidemic models to project the ICC. User-friendly software will be developed to facilitate the implementation of new methods. An immediate application of the proposed methods is their application to the Botswana Combination Prevention Project to improve the estimation of intervention effect and to generate reliable ICC estimates for designing future CRTs in the same population. The proposed methods can be applied to other ongoing and future CRTs, and more broadly, to longitudinal studies and agreement studies where ICCs are also of great interest. The proposed research is significant, because success in addressing these issues will improve the ability to design efficient and well-powered CRTs and the precision in estimating the effects of intervention strategies. Innovation lies in the development of improved computing algorithms adapting approaches from deep learning, the use of semiparametric efficiency theory, and the integration of network modeling, epidemic modeling and statistical inference. The results of the proposed research will benefit both ongoing and future CRTs, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately expedite the control of infectious diseases. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because improved methodologies for the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials will benefit both ongoing and future studies, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately improve public health response intended to control the spread of infectious diseases. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIAID’s mission that pertains to conducting and supporting research to prevent infectious diseases and to respond to emerging public health threats.",Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases,9661636,R01AI136947,"['AIDS prevention', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Botswana', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ebola virus', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Epidemic', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'collaboratory', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'high standard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'success', 'systems research', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'user friendly software']",NIAID,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2018,263913,-0.0035050481080045426
"Sequencing and Genotyping in Diverse Populations:  Who Wants What Back (and When)? PROJECT SUMMARY The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a national annual mid-sized conference series held in Cleveland, Ohio. The conference series aims to serve as a venue for the continuing education and exchange of scientific ideas related to the rapidly evolving and highly interdisciplinary landscape that is precision medicine research. The topics for each conference coincide with the national conversation and research agenda set by national research programs focused on precision medicine. The 2018 conference is a symposium that will focus on issues related to return of genomic results both in clinical and research settings with an emphasis on diverse populations. The conference will be organized as a traditional format with invited speakers from among national experts for topics ranging from issues returning research results to culturally diverse participants and family members, inclusion of diverse patient and participant populations in the Clinical Sequencing Evidence- Generating Research (CSER) consortium and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program, pharmacogenomics-guided dosing and race/ethnicity, strategies used to return results, among others. 2019 and beyond conference topics are being considered from previous symposia attendees and trends in precision medicine research. Odd-numbered year conferences include a workshop component that has previously covered outcome and exposure variable extraction from electronic health records. Future workshop topics being considered include integration of multiple ‘omics, drug response in different populations, pharmacogenomics clinical implementation, precision medicine in cancer, data sharing and informed consent, and the use of apps for recruitment, diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment. Our second major objective of this conference series is the promotion of diversity in the biomedical workforce. It is well-known that the pipeline from training to full professor for women in biomedical research is leaky whereas the pipeline for under-represented minorities is practically non-existent. Drawing from national and local sources, we vet women and under-represented minorities for every invited speaker opportunity, thereby providing valuable career currency and networking opportunities. We will also encourage women and under-represented minorities, particularly at the trainee level, to attend and participate in this conference series to spur interest in pursuing precision medicine research as a career. Overall, the North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine series is a valuable addition to the national conference landscape, and with its unique location and low cost to participants, will serve as an important educational opportunity as precision medicine research accelerates in earnest. PROJECT NARRATIVE The North Coast Conference on Precision Medicine is a yearly fall conference series in Cleveland, Ohio designed as a continuing education forum in the burgeoning area of precision medicine research. The conference brings together national experts on a host of topics ranging from bioethics to bioinformatics to biomedical informatics to speak and lead workshops on timely challenges posed in translating complex genomic and health data into clinical practice. The conference series also serves to promote diversity in the biomedical workforce.

"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline.

"Innovative text-mining tools to accelerate citation screening: comparative efficiency and impact on conclusions Project Summary Systematic reviews (SRs) synthesize and critically assess bodies of evidence to produce a comprehensive unbiased assessment of what is known. As such, SRs are vital for evidence-based decision-making. However, given the pace of new research, the process of developing an SR remains too slow. One particularly time-consuming step in the process is citation screening, which requires manual review of thousands of abstracts to identify only a small number of relevant studies. Screening such large numbers of studies is necessary because systematic reviewers place a high priority on identifying all relevant studies to avoid bias. Innovative citation screening tools, which utilize text-mining and new sophisticated machine learning methods, represent one potential solution. Abstrackr (Brown University) and EPPI-Reviewer (University College London) are off- the-shelf, web-based citation screening tools designed to improve screening efficiency. Both programs utilize machine- learning techniques to semi-automate the screening process by modeling the probability that each citation will meet criteria for inclusion. This allows efficiency gains through screening prioritization and screening truncation. With screening prioritization, citations are organized for screening from highest to lowest likelihood of inclusion. This allows earlier retrieval of full-text articles and facilitates workflow planning. Organizing citations by likelihood of inclusion also allows reviewers the option of truncating the screening process when remaining citations fall below a certain threshold. While promising, existing studies have predominantly been performed by computer scientists testing individual tools or comparing different modeling algorithms (e.g., various classifiers). To date, no studies have performed a direct comparison of citation screening tools. Similarly, although automatically excluding citations that fall below particular thresholds could substantively improve efficiency, adoption has been low due to concerns that relevant studies could be missed. However, how often studies would be missed and how important such omissions would be remains unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, this project will (1) Compare screening efficiency for two citation-screening tools, Abstrackr and EPPI-reviewer, and (2) Characterize the potential impact of using thresholds to exclude low probability studies automatically. To address aim 1, using citations from 3 large and 6 small completed evidence reports, we will compare Abstrackr to EPPI-Reviewer for citation screening. Using screening prioritization, we will assess what proportion of articles must be screened to identify all included studies (e.g., to achieve 100% sensitivity). For Aim 2, we will explore the potential impact of excluding all citations that fall below particular thresholds during the screening process. We will also assess to what extent missing these studies would alter report conclusions. By characterizing potential efficiency gains from new, innovative, and widely accessible tools, this project can facilitate wider adoption by evidence based practice centers seeking to speed systematic review production. Project Narrative Systematic reviews provide a comprehensive, unbiased assessment of a body of literature and are vital for timely, evidence-based decision-making. However, development of systematic reviews remains too slow, with one particularly time-consuming step being citation screening, in which thousands of research abstracts are manually reviewed to identify a small number of relevant studies. By testing potential gains in citation screening efficiency offered by two innovative, widely-accessible machine- learning tools (Abstrackr and EPPI–Reviewer), and determining if automatically excluding studies to improve speed compromises report conclusions, we hope to enable more rapid production of systematic reviews to inform clinicians and policy-makers and promote high quality, evidence-based patient care.",Innovative text-mining tools to accelerate citation screening: comparative efficiency and impact on conclusions,9435231,R03HS025859,[' '],AHRQ,ECRI INSTITUTE,R03,2018,95324,-0.015325954681878232
"POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION Project Summary Malaria that results from Plasmodium falciparum is among the most globally devastating human diseases. The principle vector of malaria, mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex, are thus central targets for controlling the human health burden of Plasmodium. For nearly two decades, there have been large-scale, coordinated efforts to diminish mosquito populations, generally through spraying and insecticide treated bed nets. Indeed such control efforts have now led to a nearly 50% decrease in the rates of malaria infection in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. At present, however, control efforts of A. gambiae are being threatened by evolutionary responses within mosquitos: A. gambiae populations have shown increases in insecticide resistance as well as behavioral adaptations that allow mosquitos to avoid spraying all together. Thus adaptation of mosquitos to the control efforts themselves is currently a risk to maintain the gains made in the fight against malaria. In this proposal we lay out an integrated population genomic approach for systematically identifying regions of the A. gambiae genome that are evolving adaptively in response to ongoing control efforts. Our approach centers upon state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques that we have recently introduced for finding the signatures of selective sweeps in genomes (Schrider and Kern, 2016), coupled with the large-scale population genomic datasets currently in production by the Ag1000G consortium. Project Narrative Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has enormous impacts on human health globally. For the past 16 years, large gains have been made in decreasing the rate of malaria transmission through control of its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae; unfortunately at present these control efforts are in danger of collapse due to the evolution of insecticide resistance in the mosquitos. We aim to discover the genomic targets of such resistance through the development of sophisticated population genomic approaches and their application to state-of- the-art genome sequence datasets from Anopheles gambiae.",POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION,9815897,R01GM117241,[' '],NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2018,276973,-0.023294462967837076
"A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks New advances in biomedical research have made it possible to collect multiple data “views” — for example, genetic, metabolomic, and clinical data — for a single patient. Such multi-view data promises to offer deeper insights into a patient's health and disease than would be possible if just one data view were available. However, in order to achieve this promise, new statistical methods are needed.  This proposal involves developing statistical methods for the analysis of multi-view data. These methods can be used to answer the following fundamental question: do the data views contain redundant information about the observations, or does each data view contain a different set of information? The answer to this question will provide insight into the data views, as well as insight into the observations. If two data views contain redundant information about the observations, then those two data views are related to each other. Furthermore, if each data view tells the same “story” about the observations, then we can be quite conﬁdent that the story is true.  The investigators will develop a uniﬁed framework for modeling multi-view data, which will then be applied in a number of settings. In Aim 1, this framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data (e.g. a single set of patients, with both clinical and genetic measurements), in order to determine whether a single clustering can adequately describe the patients across all data views, or whether the patients cluster separately in each data view. In Aim 2, the framework will be applied to multi-view network data (e.g. a single set of proteins, with both binary and co-complex interactions measured), in order to determine whether the nodes belong to a single set of communities across the data views, or a separate set of communities in each data view. In Aim 3, the framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data in order to determine whether the observations can be embedded in a single latent space across all data views, or whether they belong to a separate latent space in each data view. In Aims 1–3, the methods developed will be applied to the Pioneer 100 study, and to the protein interactome. In Aim 4(a), the availability of multiple data views will be used in order to develop a method for tuning parameter selection in unsupervised learning. In Aim 4(b), protein communities that were identiﬁed in Aim 2 will be validated experimentally. High-quality open source software will be developed in Aim 5.  The methods developed in this proposal will be used to determine whether the ﬁndings from multiple data views are the same or different. The application of these methods to multi-view data sets, including the Pioneer 100 study and the protein interactome, will improve our understanding of human health and disease, as well as fundamental biology. Biomedical researchers often collect multiple “types” of data (e.g. clinical data and genetic data) for a single patient, in order to get a fuller picture of that patient's health or disease status than would be possible using any single data type. This proposal involves developing new statistical methods that can be used in order to analyze data sets that consist of multiple data types. Applying these methods will lead to new insights and better understanding of human health and disease.","A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks",9535429,R01GM123993,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Set protein', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,315184,-0.041246427877158306
"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes.

"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9548627,U24CA199374,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Felis catus', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'annotation  system', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2018,573677,-0.020215818356181754
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9593059,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,750000,-0.015349904662953807
"The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease Most investigations of craniosynostosis focus on the dermatocranium, the second cranial skeleton to form during embryogenesis that comprises the dermal bones of the cranial vault and facial skeleton. A completely separate cranial skeleton, the chondrocranium, develops before the dermatocranium to support the embryonic brain and other sense organs. Historically, the chondrocranium has been studied across the vertebrates and is recognized as fundamental to craniofacial development, but it is not well known to craniofacial biologists and has never been studied in the laboratory mouse until now. The chondrocranium is formed of cartilage and though parts of it ossify endochondrally, other portions begin to degenerate by about embryonic day 15-16 in the mouse. By careful analysis of whole mount and histological specimens, we have documented the synchronized deterioration of select chondrocranial elements with the appearance and superimposition of particular dermal bones of the growing dermatocranium. These observations signal the existence of a mechanism for the coordinated, localized expansion (dermal bones) and resorption (cartilage) of two developmentally and evolutionarily separate skeletal systems. Our project, supported by strong preliminary data of the mouse chondrocranium, is designed to test a central hypothesis: that the chondrocranium serves as a structural and functional scaffold for the later development of dermatocranial elements including the formation of cranial vault sutures. Based on the common finding that boundaries between different cell populations often serve as tissue organizers, we recognize the establishment and maintenance of stable boundaries that restrict the mixing of different cell populations as critical to proper development, and propose a research design that interrogates the chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundary as significant to the coordinated development of the skull. We will interrogate cells at specific sites to determine the processes that function to maintain the boundaries. Then using the Fgfr2c+/C342Y mouse model for craniosynostosis, we will investigate relevant chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundaries operative in the development of two craniosynostosis phenotypes: premature closure of the coronal suture and abnormal growth of the midface. That the chondrocranium is composed of irregularly shaped cartilages, many of which are short-lived, requires that we conceive new tools for analysis. We will complete development of an innovative system to dissect and reconstruct the chondrocranium in silico from micro computed tomography images with tight temporal control, precisely delineate chondrocranial anatomy in 3D over embryonic time, and establish the role of the chondrocranium in development of the dermatocranium. Achieving our goals will enrich textbook knowledge of craniofacial development by defining the role of the chondrocranium in the production of dermatocranial phenotypes, provide information relative to the pathophysiology of countless craniofacial anomalies, and reveal potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutics. Craniofacial anomalies are common birth defects that require comprehensive, sometimes repetitive corrective surgeries to manage individual cases. To ameliorate the financial and emotional burden on patients and their families, efforts are aimed at the development of preventative therapies but these require a thorough understanding of craniofacial development. We offer novel information about the chondrocranium, the first embryonic cranial skeleton to develop, and focus on mechanisms operating within boundaries between it and the dermatocranium that are critical to craniofacial development, in normal individuals and in craniofacial disease.",The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease,9496083,R01DE027677,"['Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Apert-Crouzon syndrome', 'Apoptosis', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Birth', 'Bone Resorption', 'Brain', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Chondrichthyes', 'Chondrocranium', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Embryonic Structures', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory mice', 'Live Birth', 'Maintenance', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Osteoblasts', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sense Organs', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal system', 'Skeleton', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vertebrates', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'cleft lip and palate', 'coronal suture', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fibroblast growth factor receptor 2c', 'histological specimens', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'osteogenic', 'premature', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIDCR,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2018,533846,-0.0352241193062904
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples and directly translating this ‘omics data into useful biological inference. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples on which we will develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation of free-text sample-level metadata.

"Artificial neural networks for high performance, fully automated particle tracking analysis even at low signal-to-noise regimes Abstract: Particle tracking (PT) is a powerful biophysical tool for elucidating molecular interactions, transport phenomena and rheological properties in complex biological environments. Unfortunately, PT remains a niche tool in life and physical sciences with a limited user base, in large part due to significant time and technical constraints in extracting accurate time-variant positional data from recorded movies. These constraints are exacerbated in experiments with low signal-to-noise ratios or substantial heterogeneity, as frequently encountered with nanoparticles and pathogens in biological fluids. Currently available software that attempts to automate the movie analysis process rely almost exclusively on assigning static image filters based on specific intensity, pixel size and signal-to-noise ratio thresholds. Unfortunately, when applied to actual experimental data with substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity, the current software generally produces substantial numbers of false positives (i.e. tracking artifacts) or false negatives (i.e. missing actual traces), and frequently both. Frequent user intervention is thus required to ensure accurate tracking even when using sophisticated tracking software, markedly reducing experimental throughput and resulting in substantial user- to-user variations in analyzed data. The time required for accurate particle tracking analysis makes PT experiments exceedingly expensive compared to other commonly used experimental techniques in life sciences. These same tracking analysis limitations have effectively precluded investigators from undertaking more sophisticated 3D PT, even though the microscopy capability to obtain such movies is readily available and critical scientific insights can be gained from 3D PT. To circumvent the challenges with currently available particle tracking software, we have developed a new approach for particle identification and tracking, based on machine learning and convolutional neural networks (CNN). CNN is a type of feed-forward artificial neural network designed to process information in a layered network of connections that mimics the organization of real neural networks in the mammalian retina and visual cortex. Unlike most CNN imaging models that are trained to make predictions on static images, we have trained our CNN to input adjacent frames so that each prediction includes information from the past and future, thus effectively performing convolutions in both space and time to infer particle locations. Similar principles of image analysis are now being harnessed by developers of autonomous vehicle technologies to distinguish the motions of different objects on the road. We have applied our CNN tracking algorithm to a wide range of 2D movies capturing dynamic motions of nanoparticles, viruses and highly motile bacteria, achieving at least 30-fold time savings with virtually no need for human intervention while maintaining robust tracking performance (i.e. low false positive and low false negative rates). In this STTR proposal, we seek to focus on further optimization and testing of our neural network tracking platform for 2D PT, including the use of cloud computing (Aim 1), and extending our neural network tracker to enable accurate 3D PT (Aim 2). Our vision is to popularize PT as a research tool among researchers by minimizing the time and labor costs associated with PT analysis. Narrative Particle tracking is a powerful biophysical tool in life and physical sciences, but unfortunately its application has been strongly limited by inefficiencies in accurately extracting particle traces from raw movies. Unlike conventional particle tracking methods, we have combined artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a computational neural network that can recognize objects in much the same way as the human eye, and which consistently provided superior and truly automated tracking performance compared to current alternatives. This STTR will establish the feasibility of using our computational neural network for robust 2D and 3D particle tracking analysis.","Artificial neural networks for high performance, fully automated particle tracking analysis even at low signal-to-noise regimes",9347679,R41GM123897,"['Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radial', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Spottings', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical tools', 'cell motility', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'field study', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'movie', 'nanoparticle', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'physical science', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'submicron', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"AI TRACKING SOLUTIONS, LLC",R41,2017,224997,-0.021427887632886763
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9323511,R01GM097618,"['Address', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Coxibs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'synergism']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,536041,-0.03246650249963358
"Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose developing an algorithm and user-friendly software to better identify treatments using Medicare claims data. We will validate our approach using procedures listed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database as a gold standard. In this way, we hope to better match procedures identified using Medicare claims data with SEER listed procedures.  The focus of this research is observational (i.e. non-randomized) data. Well-run randomized clinical trials can provide the best level of evidence of treatment effects. However, randomized trials in the United States have suffered from poor accrual for many interventions. Despite the fact that well-designed randomized clinical trials should be the gold standard, well-designed observational studies might be the only method of obtaining inferences concerning comparative effectiveness for some cancer interventions.  In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked SEER-Medicare database. SEER-Medicare data has provided useful measurements of the effectiveness of a number of cancer therapies. Algorithms for identifying relevant treatment and diagnosis codes using Medicare data are often based on clinical reasoning and scientific evidence. One group of researchers, for example, developed an algorithm for identifying laparoscopic surgery among kidney cancer cases before claims codes for laparoscopic surgery were well developed. While such algorithms are useful for others pursuing similar investigations, there may still be substantial mismatch between treatment identified by the SEER cancer registry and treatment identified through Medicare claims. In this work, we propose developing a rigorous machine learning algorithm that can help researchers in better identifying treatments in Medicare claims data. Specifically, we will design a neural language modeling algorithm and implement a software system that finds vector representations of diagnosis and procedure codes.  We plan on using the neural language modeling algorithm to learn vector representations from SEER- Medicare claims data where related procedure and diagnosis codes are ""neighbors"" (i.e. closely related). We will investigate whether the codes we identify within neighborhoods correspond to the procedure codes used for published SEER-Medicare studies. We will then design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. Finally, we will investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm by comparing procedures identified using Medicare claims with procedures listed in the SEER database. We will replicate analyses from a published SEER-Medicare paper to investigate if estimated treatment effects differ when using our novel algorithm compared to using the algorithm in the published paper. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. To improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, we will design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. This should improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, and make conclusions drawn from analyses using the database more reliable and consistent.",Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research,9188540,R21CA202130,"['Algorithms', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Ethical Issues', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Language', 'Laparoscopic Surgical Procedures', 'Learning', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'SEER Program', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Study', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Update', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplasm registry', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'relating to nervous system', 'software systems', 'treatment effect', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'vector', 'volunteer']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R21,2017,219753,-0.039984433918986886
"QuBBD: Deep Poisson Methods for Biomedical Time-to-Event and Longitude Data  The proposed research directly addresses the mission of NIH's BD2K initiative by developing appropriate tools to derive novel insights from available Big Data and by adapting sophisticated machine learning methodology to a framework familiar to biomedical researchers. This new methodology will be one of the first to enable use of machine learning techniques with time-to-event and continuous longitudinal outcome data, and will be the first such extension of the deep Poisson model. In essence, this undertaking builds the missing bridge between the need for advanced prognostic and predictive techniques among biomedical and clinical researchers and the unrealized potential of deep learning methods in the context of biomedical data collected longitudinally. To facilitate smooth adoption in clinical research, the results will be translated into terms familiar to applied practitioners through publications and well-described software packages. The application of the methodology developed will be illustrated using data from the NIH dbGAP repository, thereby further promoting the use of open access data sources. Optimal risk models are essential to realize the promise of precision medicine. This project develops novel machine learning methods for time-to-event and continuous longitudinal data to enhance risk model performance by exploiting correlations between large numbers of predictors and genetic data.

"A high-throughput imaging and classification system for fruit flies PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In this Phase I SBIR application, FlySorter proposes to development a high throughput imaging and classification system to aid research with fruit flies, a widely-used model organism relevant to both basic science as well as studies in human health. The use of animal model systems is essential for research in almost all aspects of biology: genetics, development, neuroscience, disease, physiology, and beyond. The fruit fly – Drosophila melanogaster – is small and easy to care for, but is complex enough an organism to provide a wealth of information that directly relates to human biology and health. Over 75% of human diseases with a genetic basis (including depression, alcoholism, certain forms of cancer, and many more) are either present or have an analog in Drosophila. Modern genetic tools, such as CRISPR/cas9, allow the creation of transgenic flies that provide the opportunity to study diseases, pathways and systems that don’t exist naturally in Drosophila. With these advances, fruit flies are becoming more frequently subjects for drugs screens. For all the advances in the biological tools and techniques applicable to flies, however, the limiting factor in many experiments is the manual labor involved in a few common tasks: moving flies from vial to vial or other lab equipment; classifying and sorting flies by sex, eye color and other phenotypes; and collecting virgin female flies before they mate so that they can be used in controlled crosses, etc. FlySorter’s patent-pending fly dispensing mechanism can reliably deliver a single organism from a vial containing hundreds of awake flies, and our novel FlyPlate system allows storage of individual flies in custom 96 well plates. FlySorter’s robotic fly handling system, co-developed with the de Bivort Lab at Harvard, is capable of manipulating and transporting those individual flies between vial, 96 well plate, and experimental apparatus. The next piece of the automation puzzle to solve is high throughput imaging and classification. To accomplish this goal, FlySorter will: 1) complete a prototype automated image capture hardware system; 2) adapt state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms for use on Drosophila; and 3) build a module that can physically sort the classified flies into different vials. Once integrated into the existing FlySorter product ecosystem, this imaging and classification module will greatly expand the kinds of experiments and screens that can be automated, allowing for the study of larger populations or a wider variety of flies, reducing the impact of human error, and freeing up valuable time for researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fruit flies – Drosophila melanogaster – are one of the most widely used model organisms in biology, for research in genetics, development, neuroscience, disease, and much more. One of the most common tasks in Drosophila labs is sorting flies by various markers and phenotypes using a microscope and paintbrush. FlySorter aims to build an automated system for sorting flies using high resolution digital cameras and modern computer vision algorithms, which will obviate the need for such tedious manual labor.",A high-throughput imaging and classification system for fruit flies,9408980,R43OD023302,"['Air', 'Alcoholism', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Appearance', 'Automation', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Eye Color', 'Female', 'Floor', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Legal patent', 'Lighting', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Microscope', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Obesity', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Partner in relationship', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Pump', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Sclera', 'Shapes', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Universities', 'Vial device', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analog', 'awake', 'base', 'depression model', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic strain', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'laboratory equipment', 'male', 'meter', 'novel', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sex', 'tool', 'virtual']",OD,"FLYSORTER, LLC",R43,2017,225000,-0.01364937108510249
"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources. A) Machine learning models will be created that automatically assign probability estimates to three types of observational studies that are widely examined by systematic reviewers. B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics. A) Methods will be developed for ranking articles with respect to their relevance to a proposed new systematic review topic. B) A scoping tool will be created that displays articles ranked by predicted relevance, tagged with study design attributes, sample sizes, and Cochrane risk of bias estimates. The proposed studies will advance the automation of early steps in the process of writing systematic reviews, and thereby enhance evidence-based medicine and the incorporation of best practices into clinical care. Project Narrative Systematic reviews are essential for determining which treatments and interventions are safe and effective. At present, systematic reviews are written largely by laborious manual methods.

"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9355693,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Disease model', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,406785,-0.027923046680459595
"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia",9307096,R01AG053949,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Harvest', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevention approach', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Saliva', 'Scanning', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Site', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'aging brain', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk minimization', 'sex', 'software development', 'sound', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIA,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,407500,-0.081890678665325
"Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Supervised machine learning is a popular method that uses labeled training examples to predict future outcomes.  Unfortunately, supervised machine learning for biomedical research is often limited by a lack of labeled data.  Current methods to produce labeled data involve manual chart reviews that are laborious and do not scale with data creation rates.  This project aims to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records by forming a crowd of clinical personnel labelers.  The construction of these labeled data sets will allow for new biomedical research studies that were previously infeasible to conduct.  There are numerous practical and theoretical challenges of developing a crowd sourcing platform for clinical data.  First, popular, public crowd sourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk are not suitable for medical record labeling as HIPAA makes clinical data sharing risky.  Second, the types of clinical questions that are amenable for crowd sourcing are not well understood.  Third, it is unclear if the clinical crowd can produce labels quickly and accurately.  Each of these challenges will be addressed in a separate Aim. As the first Aim of this project, the team will evaluate different clinical crowd sourcing architectures.  The architecture must leverage the scale of the crowd, while minimizing patient information exposure.  De-identification tools will be considered to scrub clinical notes t reduce information leakage.  Using this design, the team will extend a popular open source crowd sourcing tool, Pybossa, and release it to the public.  As the second Aim, the team will study the type, structure, topic and specificity of clinical prediction questions, and how these characteristics impact labeler quality.  Lastly, the team will evaluate the quality and accuracy of collected clinical crowd sourced data on two existing chart review problems to determine the platform's utility. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traditionally, clinical prediction models rely on supervised machine learning algorithms to probabilistically predict clinical events using labeled medical records.  When data sets are small, manual chart reviews performed by clinical staff are sufficient to label each outcome; however, as data sets have scaled up and researchers aim to study larger cohorts, current manual approaches become intractable.  The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records to support prediction model development.",Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research,9270528,UH2CA203708,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Audit', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Research', 'Medical Students', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Privacy', 'Productivity', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'data sharing', 'design', 'member', 'model development', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2017,316000,-0.022881789752336772
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

Charles River Analytics and our partners at Massachusetts General Hospital and Virtual Reality Medical Center propose to design and demonstrate Constructed Environments for Successfully Sustaining Abstinence Through Immersive and On-Demand Treatment (CESSATION). We will build VR environments using our in-house game engine and content (cues) that are diverse, realistic, and well-placed, bolstering traditional psychological therapy delivery, and use research-based principles of narrative and game design to produce immersive and engaging content to motivate continued use. We will use probabilistic models (e.g., Bayesian networks) and machine-learning (e.g., neural nets) to learn from patient data and clinician input to assist in selecting and combining therapies in a way that is tailored to the individual patient. Finally, CESSATION will communicate information to clinicians in a manner that is understandable, and gives them enough meta-information to foster appropriate trust in the system.

"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease.

"Population genomics of adaptation Project Summary Malaria that results from Plasmodium falciparum is among the most globally devastating human diseases. The principle vector of malaria, mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex, are thus central targets for controlling the human health burden of Plasmodium. For nearly two decades, there have been large-scale, coordinated efforts to diminish mosquito populations, generally through spraying and insecticide treated bed nets. Indeed such control efforts have now led to a nearly 50% decrease in the rates of malaria infection in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. At present, however, control efforts of A. gambiae are being threatened by evolutionary responses within mosquitos: A. gambiae populations have shown increases in insecticide resistance as well as behavioral adaptations that allow mosquitos to avoid spraying all together. Thus adaptation of mosquitos to the control efforts themselves is currently a risk to maintain the gains made in the fight against malaria. In this proposal we lay out an integrated population genomic approach for systematically identifying regions of the A. gambiae genome that are evolving adaptively in response to ongoing control efforts. Our approach centers upon state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques that we have recently introduced for finding the signatures of selective sweeps in genomes (Schrider and Kern, 2016), coupled with the large-scale population genomic datasets currently in production by the Ag1000G consortium. Project Narrative Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has enormous impacts on human health globally. For the past 16 years, large gains have been made in decreasing the rate of malaria transmission through control of its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae; unfortunately at present these control efforts are in danger of collapse due to the evolution of insecticide resistance in the mosquitos. We aim to discover the genomic targets of such resistance through the development of sophisticated population genomic approaches and their application to state-of- the-art genome sequence datasets from Anopheles gambiae.",Population genomics of adaptation,9383198,R01GM117241,"['Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anopheles Genus', 'Anopheles gambiae', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Catalogs', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'Insecticides', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mosquito-borne infectious disease', 'Mutation', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'fight against', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'malaria infection', 'malaria transmission', 'markov model', 'novel', 'resistance allele', 'response', 'tool', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector mosquito']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2017,295480,-0.023294462967837076
"SWIFT-ActiveScreener: research and development of an intelligent web-based document screening system Project Summary More than 4,000 systematic reviews are performed each year in the fields of environmental health and evidence- based medicine, with each review requiring, on average, between six months to one year of effort to complete. In order to remain accurate, systematic reviews require regular updates after their initial publication, with most reviews out of date within five years. In the screening phase of systematic review, researchers use detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria to decide whether each article in a set of candidate citations is relevant to the research question under consideration. For each article considered, a researcher reads the title and abstract and evaluates its content with respect to the prespecified criteria. A typical review may require screening thousands or tens of thousands of articles in this manner. Under the assumption that it takes a skilled reviewer 30-90 seconds, on average, to screen a single abstract, dual-screening a set of 10,000 abstracts may require between 150 to 500 hours of labor. We have shown in previous work that automated machine learning methods for article prioritization can reduce by more than 50% the human effort required to screen articles for inclusion in a systematic review. Recently, we have further extended these methods and packaged them into a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application called SWIFT-Active Screener. Active Screener has been used successfully to reduce the effort required to screen articles for systematic reviews conducted at a variety of organizations including the National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), The Endocrine Disruption Exchange (TEDX), and the Evidence Based Toxicology Collaboration (EBTC). These early adopters have provided us with an abundance of useful data and user feedback, and we have identified several areas where we can continue to improve our methods and software. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional research and development to make significant improvements to SWIFT-Active Screener, including several innovations that will be necessary for commercial success. The research we propose encompasses three specific aims: (1) Investigate several improvements to statistical algorithms used for article prioritization and recall estimation. We will explore promising avenues for further improving the performance of our existing algorithms and address critical technical issues that limit the applicability of our current methods (Aim 1 – Improved Statistical Models). (2) Explore ways in which we can improve our models and methods to handle the scenario in which an existing systematic review is updated with new data several years after its initial publication (Aim 2 – New Methods for Systematic Review Updates). (3) Investigate several questions related to scaling the system to support hundreds to thousands of simultaneous screeners (Aim 3 - Software Engineering for Scalability, Usability and Full Text Extraction). Project Narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a web-based, collaborative systematic review software application that uses machine learning to prioritize documents for screening, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.",SWIFT-ActiveScreener: research and development of an intelligent web-based document screening system,9467160,R43ES029001,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environmental Health', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'United States Department of Agriculture', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Update', 'Work', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'research and development', 'screening', 'success', 'systematic review', 'usability']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R43,2017,211900,-0.001169413819442073
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement. The technology we propose will also contribute to the sharing of predictive models in ways that meet the needs of genomic research and healthcare.",BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy,9371707,K99HG009680,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Authorization documentation', 'Award', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Databases', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fibrinogen', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Institution', 'Institutional Policy', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer science', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness research', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'open source', 'peer', 'peer networks', 'permissiveness', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'privacy protection', 'programs', 'public trust', 'success', 'trend', 'web portal', 'web services']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2017,93824,-0.013497076762975424
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data. The Reactome database and web site enable scientists, clinicians, researchers, students, and educators to find, organize, and utilize biological information to support data visualization, integration and analysis.",Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways,9209155,U41HG003751,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Applications Grants', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Readability', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'clinically significant', 'data visualization', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'novel', 'outreach', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'tool', 'web site']",NHGRI,ONTARIO INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,U41,2017,1354554,-0.0230788568519612
"Policy Surveillance: the Future of Scientific Legal Mapping. “Policy surveillance” is the “ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of information about a given body of public health law and policy” (Chriqui, O'Connor, and Chaloupka 2011). Policy surveillance produces reliable longitudinal data for evaluating the health effects of laws; it can also increase public and policymaker awareness of trends in the law, and support diffusion of promising and evidence-based policy innovations. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) supported the development of policy surveillance programs, through NIAAA’s Alcohol Policy Information System (APIS) and the National Cancer Institute’s CLASS. More recently, NIDA has funded the launch of two policy surveillance programs, the Prescription Drug Abuse Policy System (PDAPS) and the Drug Abuse Policy System (DAPS). CDC has been increasing its support for policy surveillance activities, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has funded a Policy Surveillance Program to provide methodological and technical assistance, and maintain LawAtlas.org, a general health policy surveillance portal. As more and more researchers and consumers enter the field — from the state, federal and international levels and in private industry — harmonization of terms, methodological standards, and consensus on any needed governance mechanisms is valuable to ensure continued growth and adoption of this important scientific process and its valuable products. To meet these needs, we propose to convene one conference of 30-35 invited attendees who represent the practice’s primary stakeholders from across research, technology and practice; develop, publish and disseminate at least one report that summarizes the discussion and consensus reached among attendees; and establish a one-year plan of collaborative work towards further cooperation and cohesion. Project Narrative Policy surveillance produces reliable longitudinal data for evaluating the health effects of laws, can increase public and policymaker awareness of trends in the law, and support diffusion of promising and evidence-based policy innovations to improve health. A conference funded by NIH will harmonize terms and methodological standards, and will build consensus on field leadership and governance needed to ensure continued growth and adoption of this important scientific process and its valuable products.",Policy Surveillance: the Future of Scientific Legal Mapping.,9331919,R13DA043979,"['Adoption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Categories', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Drug abuse', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Information Dissemination', 'Information Technology', 'International', 'Laws', 'Leadership', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Policies', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Sum', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Wood material', 'Work', 'alcohol policy information system', 'cohesion', 'data access', 'data structure', 'development policy', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'prescription drug abuse', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend', 'uptake']",NIDA,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R13,2017,24772,-0.022283350052540327
"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,9266344,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical predictors', 'education research', 'graduate student', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'undergraduate student']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2017,229691,-0.011807471738220162
"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals). Project Narrative Biological assays are the foundation for developing drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolu- tionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that assays are written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized descriptions readable by computers. This lack of machine-readable annotations is a major impediment to manage, find, compare, re-use, and learn from the millions of assays. This project will develop a formal process and integrated tools to support the complete cycle of tasks and decisions required for bioassay annotation, enabling expedited (and more cost-effective) drug discovery.","Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols",9398728,U01LM012630,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'FAIR principles', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Hour', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polishes', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Readability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Update', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'informatics training', 'novel', 'open source', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2017,546372,-0.02417392246166815
"ISPW8 Conference: Designing the next generation of closed loop seizure control Project Summary The overall objective of this effort is to convene “ISPW8: Designing the next generation of closed loop seizure control”, that will take place August 20-23, 2017 at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. This conference is the next in a series of seizure prediction workshops that started in 2002, and has become the premier international venue for quantitative epilepsy research. The goal of this upcoming meeting is to focus on the development of all stages of a next-generation seizure control device. The first day will have two didactic sessions, one focusing on the clinical aspects of epilepsy, the other on Big Data analytic techniques. The body of the conference will be organized around themes motivated by the three stages of closed loop intervention: 1) input: sensing and biomarkers, 2) processing: system analysis, 3) output: intervention. The theme of the second day of will be on multimodal sensors and biomarkers of epilepsy, focused especially on developing new technology. The theme of the third day will be on utilizing advanced machine learning, statistics, and computational models, to understand and characterize the large datasets from high resolution technology. The final day will be on novel interventions and control theory: new strategies for implantable anti-seizure interventions and methods for optimizing them, as well as implementation into closed loop control devices. “Provocative sessions” at the end of each day will focus on unpublished research and hypotheses followed by discussion and debate. Through this conference we aim to build bridges between the many disciplines that comprise this unique field: theoretical, computational, experimental, clinical, and industry, while also preparing the next wave of young researchers. The overall goal is to develop improved quantitative methods to predict, quantify, characterize, and control seizures. NIH funding is sought for travel support to encourage US participation. Project Relevance/Project Narrative We plan to convene an international meeting to address questions at the intersection of clinical neurophysiology, engineering, computational and epilepsy neuroscience using emerging technologies and quantitative methods.

"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9250167,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,400107,-0.013114022665932352
"Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Big data"" such as those arising from sequencing, imaging, genomics and other emerging technologies are playing a critical role in modern biology and medicine. The generation of hypotheses about biological processes and disease mechanisms is now increasingly being driven by the production and analysis of large and complex datasets. Advanced computational methods have been developed for the robust analysis of these datasets, and the growth in number and sophistication of these methods has closely tracked the growth in volume and complexity of biomedical data. In such a crowded environment of diverse computational methods and data, it is difficult to judge how generalizable the performance of these methods is from one setting to another. Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have now become popular mechanisms for the rigorous, blinded and unbiased evaluation of the performance of these methods and the identification of best-performing methods for biomedical problems. However, despite the benefits of these challenges to the biomedical research enterprise, the impact of their findings has been remarkably limited in laboratory and clinical settings. This is likely due to two important aspects of current challenges: (i) their over-emphasis on identifying the ""best"" solutions rather than tryig to comprehensively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submitted solutions, and (ii) the absence of a stable channel of communication and collaboration between problem and solution providers due to a lack of sufficient incentives to do so. The aim of this project is to boost the translational impact of scientific challenges through a combination of novel machine learning methods, development of novel scalable software and unique collaborations with disease experts to ensure the effective translation of knowledge accrued in challenges to real clinical settings and practice. These novel methods and software are designed to effectively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submissions to challenges into ""ensemble"" solutions. In a first of its kind effort, the ensemble solutions derived from disease-focused challenges under the DREAM project will be brought directly to scientists and clinicians that are experts in these disease areas. Initial effort in this project will focus on active DREAM challenges aiming at the accurate prediction of drug response and clinical outcomes respectively in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Both these diseases are difficult to treat and thus they pose major medical and public health concerns. In collaboration with RA and AML experts, the ensemble solutions learnt in these challenges will be validated in independent patient cohorts and carefully designed clinical studies. This second-level validation is essential to judge the clinical applicability of any method, but is rarely done As the methodology is general, similar efforts will be made for other diseases in later stages of the project. Overall, using a smart combination of crowdsourcing-based challenges and computational methods and software, we aim to demonstrate a unique pathway for studying and treating disease by truly leveraging the ""wisdom of the crowds"". PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have become a popular mechanism to identify innovative solutions to complex biomedical problems. However, the collective effort of all the challenge participants has been under utilized, and the overall impact on actual clinical and laboratory practice has been remarkably limited. Using novel computational methods and novel ""big data""-friendly software implementation, we plan to demonstrate how biomedical challenges, combined with our approach, can influence clinical practice in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Rheumatoid Arthritis, as well as rigorously validate our approach.",Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning,9251828,R01GM114434,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Design', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge translation', 'learning progression', 'method development', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'stem', 'tool', 'translational impact']",NIGMS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,428512,-0.03149081327745001

"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris�n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris�n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,9264531,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'public health relevance']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2017,339750,-0.011792291429498405
"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design New technologies afford the acquisition of dense “data clouds” of individual humans. However, heterogeneity, dimensionality and multi-scale nature of such data (genomes, transcriptomes, clinical variables, etc.) pose a new challenge: How can one query such dense data clouds of mixed data as an integrated set (as opposed to variable by variable) against multiple knowledge bases, and translate the joint molecular information into the clinical realm? Current lexical mapping and brute-force data mining seek to make heterogeneous data interoperable and accessible but their output is fragmented and requires expertise to assemble into coherent actionable information. We propose DeepTranslate, an innovative approach that incorporates the known actual physical organization of biological entities that are the substrate of pathogenesis into (i) networks (data graphs) and (ii) hierarchies of concepts that span the multiscale space from molecule to clinic. Organizing data sources along such natural structures will allow translation of burgeoning high-dimensional data sets into concepts familiar to clinicians, while capturing mechanistic relationships. DeepTranslate will take a hybrid approach to learn and organize its content from both (i) existing generic comprehensive knowledge sources (GO, KEGG, IDC, etc.) and (ii) newly measured instances of individual data clouds from two demonstration projects: (1) ISB’s Pioneer 100 and (2) St. Jude Lifetime cancer survivors. We will focus on diabetes as test case. These two studies cover a deep biological scale-space and thus can test the full extent of the multiscale capacity of DeepTranslate in a focused application. 1. TYPES OF RESEARCH QUESTION ENABLED. How can a clinician find out that the dozens of “out of range” variables observed in a patient’s data cloud, form a connected set with respect to pathophysiology pathways, from gene to clinical variable? How can the high-dimensional data of studies that measure for each individual 100+ data points of various types (“personal data clouds”) be analyzed as one set in an integrated fashion (as opposed to variable by variable) against existing knowledge bases and also be used to improve the databases? DeepTranslate addresses these two types of questions and thereby will accelerate translation of future personal data clouds into (A) care decisions and (B) hypotheses on new disease mechanisms / treatments, thereby benefiting providers as well as researchers. 2. USE OF EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES. ■ ISB: pioneer in personalized, big-data driven medicine (Demo Project 1); biomedical content expertise; multiscale omics and molecular pathogenesis, big data analysis, housing of databases for public access; query engine designs, GUI. ■ UCSD: leader in biomedical data integration; automated assembly of molecular and clinical data into hierarchical structures; translation between data types ■ U Montreal: biomedical database curation from literature and construction of gene/protein/drug interaction networks; machine learning, open resource database ■ St Jude CRH: Cancer monitoring Demo Project 2, cancer patient data analytics. 3. POTENTIAL DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. (a) Existing comprehensive clinical data sources are not uniform and not explicitly based on biological networks; cross-mapping is being performed at NLM based on lexical relationships: HPO (phenotypes) vs. SNOMED CT (for EMR) vs. IDC or Merck Manual (for diseases). Careful selection of these sources in close collaboration with NLM is needed. (b) Existing molecular pathway databases are static, based on averages of heterogeneous non-stratified populations, while the newly measured high-dimensional data clouds are varied due to intra-individual temporal fluctuation and inter-individual variation. How this will affect building of ontotypes in our hybrid approach, and how large cohorts of data clouds must be to offer statistical power is yet to be determined. Our two Demonstration Projects with their uniquely deep (high-dimensional and multiscale) data in cohorts of limited but growing size are thus crucial first steps in a long journey of collective learning in the TRANSLATOR community. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9486059,OT3TR002026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'CRH gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SNOMED Clinical Terms', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'lexical', 'molecular assembly/self assembly', 'new technology', 'transcriptome']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT3,2017,1408263,-0.02764320046384224
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"The Blackfynn Platform for Rapid Data Integration and Collaboration Summary One in seven people worldwide suffers from a brain disorder, e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's, stroke, or dementia. Development of future treatments depends on improving our understanding of brain function and disease, and validating new treatments critically depends on identifying the underlying biomarkers associated with different conditions. Biomarker discovery requires volume, quality, richness, and diversity of data. This Direct-to-Phase II project extends Blackfynn's cloud data management platform for team science, in order to support interactive data curation and integration and to facilitate biomarker discovery. Our first technical aim develops tools to help select, curate, assess, and regularize datasets: we develop novel “live” query capabilities to ensure users discover relevant data, develop mechanisms for using data's provenance to decide on trustworthiness, and build tools for mapping fields to common data elements. These capabilities address the critical, under-served problem of selecting the data to analyze. Our second technical aim develops techniques for incorporating algorithms to link and co-register across multi-modal data and metadata. Using ranking and machine learning, we can incorporate and combine state-of-the-art algorithms for finding data relationships, and we can link to remote data sources. These capabilities enable scientists to analyze richer datasets with multiple data modalities and properties – thus enabling them to discover more complex correlations and biomarkers. In our third aim, Blackfynn's new technical capabilities will be applied to challenges faced by Blackfynn partners, including problems assessing trustworthiness of data annotations, conducting image analysis, modeling epileptic networks, and identifying biomarkers for neuro-oncology indications. As part of this validation we will also develop HIPAA-compliant mechanisms for working with protected and de-identified data together. Together, these three thrusts will ensure that development of the Blackfynn platform results in tools and technologies that meaningfully accelerate scientific understanding and discovery over rich and complex data, leading to improved treatments for neurologic disease.   Narrative This Direct-to-Phase II project extends the Blackfynn cloud data management platform to enable biomarker discovery for research and development of improved drugs, devices and clinical care for patients with neurologic disease: it develops tools for assembling, evaluating, and rating data, and linking it across modalities and to external systems.

"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9544350,R01EB021396,"['Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'clinical translation', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'portability', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2017,56360,-0.01330857296946699

"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Summary The objective of ‘Assay Central’ is to compile a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADMET) properties, in a form that is immediately ready for model building and other forms of analysis using cheminformatics methods. This is aided by the existence of many sources of curated open data, and one in particular, ChEMBL 1, 2 will be used as the nucleus in Phase I. This bioassay data collection is incredibly valuable, but not currently provided in a form that is ready-to-go for use by small research and development (R&D) organisations that do not have their own in-house cheminformatics teams. The effort required to preprocess, filter, merge, validate and normalize the structure and activity data requires a great deal of software expertise and medicinal chemistry domain knowledge, which are key skillsets that are rare and expensive to combine within the same team. Create a script to analyze the databases like ChEMBL, selected parts of PubChem and others 1, 2 and partition it into groups of compatible activity measurements against the same target. We will seed the dataset collection with a set of 1840 target-assay groups that have been recently extracted from the ChEMBL v20 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements 3, using methodology that we have already developed (similar to that described in 4). We will build error checking and correction software. We will apply best-of-breed methodology for checking and correcting structure-activity data 5 which errs on the side of caution for problems with non- obvious solutions, so that we can manually identify problems and either apply patches, or datasource-specific automated corrections. We will build and validate Bayesian models with the datasets collected and cleaned. For each of the target-activity groups, we will create a Bayesian model using ECFP6 or FCFP6 fingerprints, and this will be one of the primary outputs from the project. Models will be evaluated using internal and external testing with receiver operator characteristic (ROC > 0.75), the integral of the true-negative-rate – true-positive-rate curve as well as the enrichment,6 Kappa value and positive predicted value.7 We will develop new data visualization tools as a proof of concept in phase I. We have already begun to explore preliminary visualization methods using multiple models, but these have so far focused primarily on a handful of machine learning models selected from a very large list. New visualization techniques are required to summarize large matrices of data, e.g. a list of proposed structures vs. thousands of target models. In Phase II we will expand by upgrading to newer ChEMBL releases, selectively incorporating screening runs from other databases (such as PubChem 8), These tools will consist of software created explicitly for this project (particularly web-based interfaces), as well as enhanced functionality added to 3rd party tools that we influence (e.g. mobile apps) and open source projects that we have already contributed to (e.g. CDK for fingerprints and Bayesian modelling). We will widely publicise Assay Central at conferences and in papers. Being able to use transparent computational models simultaneously for visualizing activity trends for multiple targets (both diseases and ADMET) removes the burden of curation or purchasing and maintaining expensive software, and drastically simplifies the addition of new data. It also represents a new frontier of drug discovery as a world of small, agile distributed R&D organizations has access to valuable public datasets that can inform their research. Such computational models will assist in drug repurposing efforts internally and with our collaborators while likely identifying new compounds for a wide array of drug discovery projects. Narrative There are massive publically accessible databases that include a broad variety of disease targets and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADMET) properties that are not a form that is immediately ready for machine learning model building. The ‘Assay Central’ project will compile a comprehensive collection of these datasets (from PubChem and ChEMBL) for structure-activity data. This will enable the user to quickly and automatically use machine learning models for various targets and properties. The approach will also have high value for drug repurposing efforts and identifying new compounds for targets with creation of new IP in our own research on neglected and rare diseases and in the laboratories of customers.",Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations,9254390,R43GM122196,"['Attention', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Excretory function', 'Fingerprint', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxicology', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'absorption', 'cheminformatics', 'data visualization', 'drug discovery', 'frontier', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mobile application', 'model building', 'neglect', 'open data', 'open source', 'research and development', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2017,149999,-0.03738345318136294
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections. Validating the molecular targets of these compounds for in vivo nerve growth will enable future drug discovery projects focused on these targets.",Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury,9401793,R01NS100531,"['Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Complement 5a', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Control Animal', 'Contusions', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Failure', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Injectable', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery of Function', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Viral Vector', 'Walking', 'axon growth', 'axon regeneration', 'behavior test', 'behavioral outcome', 'central nervous system injury', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injured', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'light microscopy', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'targeted agent', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,474406,-0.02945061209250267
"Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II project aims to continue development of a commercial quality, innovative cloud hosted information management system, called Climb 2.0(tm) that will increase laboratory efficiency and provide improved capabilities for research laboratories. Climb is designed to offer integrated laboratory process management modules that include mobile communications tools data monitoring and alert systems, and integrated access to Microsoft Azure Cloud(tm) Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services. Initially, Climb 2.0 will target animal model research laboratories; however, the core of the platform is designed to be adaptable to nearly any research type or related industry. Current research information management systems are primarily designed as record-keeping tools with little or no direct focus on laboratory efficiency or in enhancing value of the research data. They also do not leverage emergent mobile device technologies, social media frameworks, and data analysis and storage capabilities of cloud computing. Many laboratories still use paper as their primary recording system. Paper data logging is then followed by secondary data entry into a laboratory database. These systems are error prone, time consuming and lead to laboratory databases with significant time lags between data acquisition and data entry. Moreover, they do not recognized cumulative data relationships, which may identify important trends, and researchers often miss windows of opportunity to take action on time-sensitive events. In Phase I, RockStep Solutions demonstrated feasibility of an innovative Cloud Information Management Bundle system, Climb, which will increase efficiency and improve capabilities in animal model data management. During Phase I, a beta version of Climb was successfully developed and tested against strict performance metrics as a proof of concept. We successfully built a prototype with working interfaces that integrates real-time communication technologies with media capabilities of mobile devices. Phase II proposes four specific Aims: 1) Develop the technology infrastructure to support the secure and scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of Climb for enterprise commercial release; 2) Develop and extend the Phase-I prototype Data Monitoring and Messaging System (DMMS) into a platform ready for production use; 3) Extend Climb's DMMS adding a Stream Analytics engine to support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and streaming media; 4) Deploy a beta release of Climb at partner research labs, test and refine the product for final commercialization. To ensure Climb is developed with functionality and tools relevant to research organizations, RockStep Solutions has established collaborations with key beta sites to test all of the major functionality developed in this proposal. IMPACT: By leveraging emergent technologies and cloud computing, Climb offers several advantages: 1) enables real-time communications using familiar tools among members of research groups; 2) reduces the risk of experimental setbacks, and 3) enables complex experiments to be conducted efficiently. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Invests approximately $12 billion each year in animal model research that is central to both understanding basic biological processes and for developing applications directly related to improving human health. More cost-effective husbandry and colony management techniques, equipment, and new approaches to improve laboratory animal welfare and assure efficient and appropriate research use (e.g., through cost savings and reduced animal burden) are high priorities for NIH. RockStep Solutions proposes to meet this need by integrating existing and emergent software and communication technologies to create a novel solution, Climb 2.0, for research animal data management. Climb 2.0 extracts immediate value of data in animal research laboratories and extends the database into a multimedia communication network, thus enabling science that would be impractical to conduct with traditional methods.",Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research,9354497,R44GM112206,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communications Media', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Information Management', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multimedia', 'Notification', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'design', 'encryption', 'experimental study', 'good laboratory practice', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'service learning', 'social media', 'software as a service', 'success', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"ROCKSTEP SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2017,739402,-0.01363864580820614
"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This program focuses on the development and dissemination of online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health.

"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility. This work is relevant to NIH's public health mission by providing a quantitative framework for establishing precision medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases.",Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility,9355203,K99GM118907,"['Adjuvant', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biology', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease Resistance', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Peritoneal', 'Peritoneal Fluid', 'Peritoneal lavage', 'Phase', 'Phosphorus', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Source', 'Sulfur', 'Supplementation', 'Symbiosis', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'bacterial metabolism', 'bactericide', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'counterscreen', 'desensitization', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infectious disease treatment', 'insight', 'killings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2017,87929,-0.03441578538896886
"Development of An Integrated High Throughput Imaging and Image Analysis Platform for Muscle ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is growing awareness that weakness of muscle is a significant biomedical health issue associated with many different chronic diseases and aging. There are a variety of different diseases that affect muscle, including muscular dystrophy, fibromyalgia, cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis, each of which carries its own unique set of symptoms, accompanied by a myriad of genetic and molecular abnormalities. There is agreement within the basic research and clinical communities that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber cross sectional area, fiber type, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration, and fibrosis are among many critical factors that determine the health and functionality of the muscle. Until now, the imaging equipment available is relatively low throughput and the quantification is still largely based on manual or, at best, semi-automatic methods that require extensive human intervention. In Phase I, CytoInformatics LLC has developed a software called CytoQuant, which can accurately perform automatic segmentation and provide accurate boundaries of each muscle fiber for a cropped image patch. The goal of CytoInformatics LLC in Phase II is to 1) deliver the first version of the CytoQuant software to the market, 2) develop the second version of CytoQuant by continuously improving its performance, especially in handling large scale, whole slide images, and also 3) develop an integrated multiplexing imaging hardware and analysis software framework as a seamless solution for high throughput, automated image analysis of muscle specimens. After careful investigation in Phase I (please refer to the details in business plan), we conclude that this integrated software/hardware platform with cutting-edge technologies in advanced imaging, large scale machine learning, and big data is commercially attractive to the entire muscle community including research institutes, hospitals, and pharmaceutical and athletic companies, demonstrated by strong enthusiasm among end users and many supporting letters. The specific aims are: 1) Deliver the first version of CytoQuant developed in Phase I to the market, continue to develop the second version of CytoQuant, which will focus on improving the robustness and speed in handling whole slide images; 2) Develop an integrated platform that provides unified imaging hardware and image analysis software to handle whole slide images labeled with multiple bio-relevant markers. This unified whole-slide based software and hardware solution will deliver an efficient and specialized imaging platform that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, multi-marker, and automatic image analysis software specifically designed for muscle. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In Phase II, CytoInformatics is proposing a unified whole-slide multispectral imaging (MSI) system that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, accurate, and automated software to provide fast and efficient, multiplexed imaging and quantitative muscle image analysis simultaneously.

"Pilot for Creating Reproducible Workflows Using Docker Containers for NIH Commons DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds). The KnowEng environment will be deployed in a cloud infrastructure and fully available to the community, as will be the software developed by the Center. The proposed Center is a collaboration between the University of Illinois (UIUC), a recognized world leader in computational science and engineering, and the Mayo Clinic, one of the leading clinical care and research organizations in the world, and will be based at the UIUC Institute for Genomic Biology, which has state-of-the-art facilities and a nationally recognized program of multidisciplinary team-based genomic research.

"KnowEng, a Scalable Knowledge Engine for Large-Scale Genomic Data-OVERALL DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds). The KnowEng environment will be deployed in a cloud infrastructure and fully available to the community, as will be the software developed by the Center. The proposed Center is a collaboration between the University of Illinois (UIUC), a recognized world leader in computational science and engineering, and the Mayo Clinic, one of the leading clinical care and research organizations in the world, and will be based at the UIUC Institute for Genomic Biology, which has state-of-the-art facilities and a nationally recognized program of multidisciplinary team-based genomic research.

"An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata PROJECT ABSTRACT Biomedical investigators are generating increasing amounts of complex and diverse data. This data varies tremendously, from genome sequences through phenotypic measurements and imaging data. If researchers and data scientists can tap into this data effectively, then we can gain insights into disease mechanisms and how to tackle them. However, the main stumbling block is that it is increasingly hard to find and integrate the relevant datasets due to the lack of sufficient metadata. A researcher studying Crohn's disease may miss a crucial dataset on how certain microbial communities affect gut histology due to the lack of descriptive tags on the data. Currently, applying metadata is difficult, time-consuming and error prone due to the vast sea of confusing and overlapping standards for each datatype. Often specialized `data wranglers' are employed to apply metadata, but even these experts are hindered by lack of good tools. Here we propose to develop an intelligent agent that researchers and data wranglers can use to assist them apply metadata. The agent is based around a personalized dashboard of metadata elements that can be collected from multiple specialized portals, as well as sites such as Wikipedia. These elements can be coupled with classifiers that can be used to self-identify datasets to which they may be relevant, making the selection of appropriate vocabularies easier for researchers. We will deploy the system for a number of targeted use cases, including annotation of the National Center for Biomedical Information Bio-Samples repository, and annotation of images within the Figshare repository. Project Narrative Biomedical data is being generated at an increasing rate, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for researchers to be able to locate and effectively operate over this data, which has negative impacts on the rate of new discoveries. One solution is to attach metadata (data about data) onto all information generated in a research project, but application of metadata is currently difficult and time consuming due to the diverse range of standards on offer, typically requiring the expertise of trained data wranglers. Here we propose to develop an intelligent concept assistant that will allow researchers to generate and share sets of metadata elements relevant to their project, and will use machine learning techniques to automatically apply this to data.",An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata,9357656,U01HG009453,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Frustration', 'Genome', 'Histology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'dashboard', 'improved', 'insight', 'microbial community', 'peer', 'prospective', 'repository', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,U01,2017,572778,-0.012077838320561984
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus Summary In 2014, the outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses. Several groups had previously performed high throughput screens in 2013 and identified FDA approved drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene) with in vitro growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. We used these compounds to create a computational pharmacophore to identify additional compounds to test in vitro. In addition, data from a published large scale high throughput screen performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute was used to create machine learning models and then subsequently used to score clinical compounds for testing. We have published on how these combined methods identified 3 compounds for testing which were ultimately found to be nM in vitro. One of these compounds is an antimalarial approved in Europe called pyronaridine. We propose to characterize the ADME and PK properties of this compound prior to determining its efficacy in a mouse model of the Ebola virus infection. Therefore the Aims of this R21 proposal will fill some of the gaps inherent in the published data on pyronaridine so far: Aim 1. Perform preclinical in vitro characterization of pyronaridine. Aim 2. Formulate pyronaridine and perform PK studies in mouse. Aim 3. In vitro characterization of pyronaridine against multiple EBOV strains and in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection. The results of these aims will determine go/no go criteria for pursuing larger animal studies in non-human primates prior to clinical studies. In the light of a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a clinical observation that EBOV patients treated with artesunate-amodiaquine had a 31% higher survival rate than those treated with artemether- lumefantrine 2, there will be considerable interest in evaluating antimalarials against Ebola. Our proposal to consider testing the efficacy in the mouse EBOV model using pyronaridine (which is used as artesunate- pyronaridine (Pyramax) and would be readily accessible in the clinic), presents a rapid approach to leverage the aforementioned clinical observations with a more potent compound. Pyronaridine also has additional benefits of tolerability which may be important in this patient population. Narrative Preliminary clinical data showed that Ebola virus (EBOV) patients treated with the antimalarials artesunate- amodiaquine had a higher survival rate than those treated with artemether-lumefantrine, in agreement with the in vitro EC50 for amodiaquine EC50 of 2.6µM. The antimalarial pyronaridine, a structural analog of amodiaquine, was identified by a computational repurposing strategy and further shown to have an EC50 of 420 nM against EBOV in vitro. We now propose to fully characterize this compound using standard preclinical ADME assays prior to mouse pharmacokinetic analysis, determine broad-spectrum applicability against multiple EBOV strains and ultimately in vivo efficacy testing in the mouse Ebola virus model prior to testing in a non-human primate model. Our aim is to show whether Pyronaridine is a viable clinical candidate to treat patients infected with EBOV.",Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus,9357736,R21TR001718,"['Africa', 'Agreement', 'Amodiaquine', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antimalarials', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Babesia', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chloroquine', 'Chloroquine resistance', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clomiphene', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ebola virus', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Erythrocytes', 'Europe', 'European', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Female', 'Filoviridae', 'Filovirus', 'Formulation', 'Growth', 'Half-Life', 'Hour', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred BALB C Mice', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Mannich Bases', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Natural Products', 'New England', 'Oral', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Research Institute', 'Route', 'Solubility', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Toremifene', 'Toxic effect', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Inhibitors', 'Vivax Malaria', 'Whole Blood', 'analog', 'artemether', 'artesunate', 'base', 'benflumetol', 'clinical candidate', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'high throughput screening', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'male', 'mouse model', 'neurotoxicity', 'nonhuman primate', 'patient population', 'pharmacophore', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'pyronaridine', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'treatment duration']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R21,2017,312390,-0.009937175862658213
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9269122,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mechanical properties', 'microvesicles', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2017,725442,-0.016458896120070985
"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data. The Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) will extend and enhance the research capacities and productivity among investigators at the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/AIDS, Alcohol, Aging, and multi-Substance use (COMpAAAS).

"Software for OCT Analysis of Vascular Stents Software for OCT Analysis of Vascular Stents PI: Ronny Shalev, PhD, Dyad Medical Summary Dyad Medical, Inc. will create intravascular OCT (IVOCT) software for clinical, live time determination of stent apposition (OCTivat-live, the live time OCT image visualization and analysis tool) and for offline analysis of stent implantation (OCTivat-stent). Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intra- vascular stents creating an opportunity for both solutions. Although advancements such as drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent design parameters include drug, material (bioresorbable vs metal), polymer composition, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To opti- mize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical evaluations. Intravascular OCT (IVOCT) is the lone imaging modality with the resolution and contrast to meet this challenge. The Core Lab at CWRU is the premiere site in the world for manual analysis of IVOCT image data. A cardiologist analyst takes 6-16 hrs to analyze manually a single stent, and despite training and quality assurance measures, inter- analyst variability can limit the power to determine changes between stent designs. Building upon work at CWRU, we will develop advanced, highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibil- ity, increase accuracy, and harmonize analysis. Software will reduce costs by decreasing manual labor, and with improved reproducibility, possibly enable the use of historical data, eliminating cost of a control arm. Re- garding live time analysis, rather than manually reviewing >500 images in a pullback, with fast software, it will be possible to present the number and location of malapposed struts in 3D, providing instant feedback to phy- sicians on the need for additional dilatation with a larger balloon or higher pressure. In addition, we will auto- matically determine stent and vessel area along the length of the pullback, allowing us to compute stent ex- pansion and eccentricity, quantitative measures related to successful stent deployment, the most important de- terminant of outcome. IVOCT could also play a role at patient follow up. If a stent is well covered, then long- term anti-platelet therapy might be unnecessary, minimizing bleeding risk. If a stent has many uncovered struts, a therapeutic might prevent stent thrombosis or stimulate healing. Project Narrative: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year. Our methods will enable optimization of stent technologies and improved deployment for improved treatment of vascular dis- ease.",Software for OCT Analysis of Vascular Stents,9407267,R43HL137500,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dilatation - action', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Feedback', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stents', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'arm', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cost', 'design', 'follow-up', 'healing', 'image visualization', 'imaging modality', 'implantation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'personalized diagnostics', 'preclinical evaluation', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'research clinical testing', 'restenosis', 'statistics', 'stent thrombosis', 'tool', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,"DYAD MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2017,224744,-0.0070063163257697795

"Sci-Score, a tool to support rigor and transparency guidelines Project Summary While  standards  in  reporting  of  scientific  methods  are  absolutely  critical  to  producing  reproducible  science,  meeting  such  standards  is  difficult.  Checklists  and  instructions  are  tough  to  follow  often  resulting  in  low  and inconsistent  compliance.  Scientific  journals  and  societies  as  well  as  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  are  now actively proposing general guidelines to address reproducibility issues, particularly in the reporting of methods  (e.g.,  http://www.cell.com/star-­methods),  but  the  trickier  part  will  be  to  train  the  biomedical  community  to  use these standards to effectively improve how scientific methods are communicated. To support new standards in methods reporting, specifically the RRID standard for Rigor and Transparency of  Key Biological Resources, we propose to build Sci-­Score a text mining based tool suite to help authors meet the  standard.  Sci-­Score  will  provide  an  automated  check  on  compliance  with  the  RRID  standard  already  implemented by over 100 journals including Cell, Journal of Neuroscience, and eLife. The innovation behind Sci-­ score is the provision of a score, which can be obtained by individual investigators, which reflects a numerical  validation of the quality of their methods reporting. We posit that the score will serve as a tool that investigators  and journals can use to compete with themselves and each other, or in the very least allow them to see how  close they are to the average in meeting quality requirements.   Recently, our group has developed a text mining algorithm that has now been successfully been used to detect software tools and databases from the SciCrunch Registry in published papers. Digital tools are one of four resource types that the RRID standard identifies. We propose to extend this approach to the other types of entities: antibodies, cell lines and model organisms. Resource identification along with other quality metrics twill be used to train an algorithm to score the overall quality of the methods document. If successful, the tool could be used by editors, reviewers, and investigators to improve the number of RRIDs, therefore the quality of descriptors of key biological resources in published papers. This SBIR project will build a set of algorithms similar to the resource finding pipeline and develop it into an industrial robust and reconfigurable software system. Our Phase I specific aims include to 1) creating gold sets of data for each resource type and training a set of algorithms for each resource type; 2) designing and evaluating the scoring system; 3) designing and evaluating a report generating system based on the previous aims. In Phase II, we will develop a scalable backend infrastructure to serve the needs of scientific publishers and research community.

"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",9268713,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'commune', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2017,655080,0.009153263420669393
"Retinal connectome: mobile game and crowdsourcing algorithms for EyeWire II ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An online community called EyeWire proved that volunteers can be motivated to reconstruct neural circuits through an activity resembling a 3D coloring book. EyeWire helped discover space-time speciﬁcity of the wiring from bipolar cells to starburst amacrine cells, which suggested a surprising new model for direction selectivity in the retina. Motivated by this success, we are preparing to launch EyeWire II, which aims to map the entire retinal connectome, yielding the ﬁrst complete wiring diagram for any region of the mammalian CNS. This ambitious goal will require innovative advances in virtually every component of EyeWire. The underlying electron microscopic image of the retina will be replaced by a new image with increased size and quality. A new artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) will be trained using a new software package for 3D deep learning. While the improved AI is expected to reduce the amount of human effort required to reconstruct a neuron, the number of neurons targeted for reconstruction will also increase dramatically. Overall, the absolute amount of human effort required will increase rather than decrease. Therefore it is critical to improve EyeWire's crowdsourcing to (1) mobilize more human effort and (2) to use human effort more efﬁciently. This project aims to radically improve both aspects, thereby making the retinal connectome achievable by EyeWire II. In Aim 1, we will create a compelling mobile game with the target of engaging 10x more people than the existing EyeWire community. In Aim 2, we will develop and deploy new crowdsourcing algorithms that extract wisdom from the crowd by weighted voting and optimally assign players to tasks. The Aims will be achieved through collaboration between three organizations. Wired Differently, Inc. (WD) is a new Boston-based nonproﬁt organization dedicated to ""citizen neuroscience"" that was recently spun out of MIT. WD currently operates EyeWire in collaboration with the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. The Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) at Carnegie Mellon University will offer a project-based class to its master's students to design and prototype new ideas for the mobile game. Both Aims will produce code and algorithms that will be made publicly available, and could have broad impact on citizen science. As the ﬁrst crowdsourcing of 3D image analysis, the code produced by Aim 1 could be useful for the many other kinds of 3D images found in biomedical research. The crowdsourcing algorithms of Aim 2 are potentially useful for any citizen science project facing the challenge of obtaining accurate and reliable results from a heterogeneous group of volunteers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeWire II will increase public understanding of the structure of the nervous system. The retinal connectome could aid those attempting to develop blindness therapies based on regenerating cells and their wiring. It could also aid the development of retinal prosthetics that directly stimulate ganglion cells and computationally emulate the bypassed micro circuitry. 1",Retinal connectome: mobile game and crowdsourcing algorithms for EyeWire II,9330810,UH2CA203710,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blindness', 'Books', 'Boston', 'Breathing', 'Bypass', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Love', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Nonprofit Organizations', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Social Interaction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Territoriality', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Volunteer Group', 'Voting', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'connectome', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'fine art', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microscopic imaging', 'neural circuit', 'online community', 'pleasure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'retinal prosthesis', 'simulation', 'starburst amacrine cell', 'success', 'university student', 'virtual', 'visual neuroscience', 'volunteer']",NCI,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,320900,-0.015193057250516562
"Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology Project Summary Platelet transfusion is critical for severely bleeding patients and nearly 6 million units are transfused in the United States and Europe annually. In the United States, platelets are typically stored for 5 days resulting in a waste of 20% of their supply. Short storage duration is a consequence of bacterial contamination and platelet quality considerations. Though many methods have been developed for bacterial testing and pathogen inactivation, fewer have been developed for improving quality of stored platelets. Platelet additive solutions have the possibility to increase storage quality and duration, reduce plasma-related allergic reactions, impact the efficacy of pathogen reduction techniques, and save plasma which can then be used as an additional transfusion product. While the benefits are well known, there has been little progress in developing new platelet additive solutions for increasing quality and safety of platelet transfusion because there is a lack of broad understanding of biochemical and signaling changes during storage. There has been interest to utilize high-throughput metabolite profiling for global understanding of platelet metabolic decline but data analysis of complex datasets has been a daunting challenge. In Phase I of this program, we developed the first, robust computational platform involving statistical analysis and systems biology of metabolic and signaling networks to interpret and analyze PLT metabolomic and proteomic profiles in a complete network context. Using time- course global, quantitative metabolite profiling, we determined that PLTs undergo a non-linear decay process and computationally identified key metabolic enzymes and cellular process that drive this decay. Based on the computational results, we have devised two novel additive solution strategies to mitigate the decay process and improve the length of PLT units. In this Phase II proposal, we will validate the computationally determined additive solutions for efficacy in alleviating the non-linear decay process through 1) metabolomics experiments, and 2) non-metabolic PLT physiology experiments including cell activation and hemostatic effectiveness. A successful additive solution will be progressed to media refinement and preclinical testing. Project Narrative Platelet transfusion units are typically stored for five days in the United States leading to a waste of 20% of units and potential quality concerns. The field is open for innovation as most storage media technologies are derived from work from the early 1990s. This proposal will develop novel computational methods to comprehensively understand the degradation of platelets under storage conditions and experimentally validate new additive solutions for increasing platelet quality and extending shelf life, an area that accounts for $2.5 billion of hospital costs.",Improving safety and efficacy of platelet transfusion through systems biology,9347295,R44HL127843,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Preservation', 'Blood', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Blood Platelets', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Europe', 'Formulation', 'Glutathione', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hospital Costs', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'State Hospitals', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supplementation', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'model design', 'novel', 'open innovation', 'oxidative damage', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'statistics', 'success', 'time use', 'wasting']",NHLBI,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2017,1099022,-0.006421401649084033
"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation. n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,9310382,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Internships', 'Investigation', 'K-12 student', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroinformatics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,323033,-0.024812682085004267
"Optimizing electrical impedance myography outcomes through data mining Project summary  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a non-invasive technology for the assessment of muscle that is based on the application of a weak, high frequency electrical current to a muscle and the measurement of the resulting surface voltages. The further development and application of EIM remains the main business focus of Skulpt, Inc, a small business concern based in Boston and San Francisco (Specific Aims just say San Francisco). Alterations to the condition of the muscle, including myocyte atrophy, fat and connective tissue deposition, and inflammation all alter the EIM data in predictable and consistent ways. To date, through Skulpt, EIM has been applied as a potential biomarker for assessing disease progression and response to therapy in a wide variety of neuromuscular disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy, as well as other disorders that impact muscle condition, such as disuse atrophy and sarcopenia (age related muscle loss); over 1000 people have been studied with Skulpt’s EIM technology. Whereas the results of these applications are promising, the analytic approaches taken to the data sets have been fairly basic, utilizing only simple single frequency or simplistic multifrequency values. However, with every single muscle measurement, over 240 individual data points are acquired at different frequencies, different depths of muscle penetration, and at different angles to the major muscle fiber direction. Moreover, each of the above studies has been done in isolation, and thus how results differ between diseases is unknown. Given the plethora of data, applying more sophisticated analytic approaches has the potential of yielding improved EIM measures. Moreover, collaborators have already collected an associated wealth of animal EIM data that will help further inform this analysis. Thus, in this proposed Phase 1 SBIR, we plan to apply a variety of data mining techniques to the vast set of data already accumulated at Skulpt, Inc such that improved EIM outcomes can be developed and implemented. In Specific Aim 1, we will study human data across all disease types evaluated to determine which data sets are most effective at discriminating diseased from healthy muscle as well as distinguishing between diseases. In Specific Aim 2, we will focus on finding the metrics that are most sensitive to the degree of muscle pathology in a specific disease. In both of these aims, we will evaluate how these new metrics are mirrored in already obtained animal data. In Specific Aim 3, we will study these metrics in a new set of data (a test set) that was not used to develop the analytical paradigms so as to ensure their robustness. With the conclusion of this work, we will plan to pursue a Phase 2 SBIR that will focus on the development of a software suite to assist in EIM data interpretation based upon these results followed by a prospective observational clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of these newly developed metrics for disease diagnosis and tracking of progression/response to therapy. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a non-invasive technology for the assessment of muscle that remains the main focus of Skulpt, Inc. Considerable EIM data has already been collected in a variety of neuromuscular diseases.

"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,9303234,R00AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R00,2017,249000,-0.025710861319496597

"Bioinformatics Tools for Circadian Biology Circadian rhythms are fundamental for understanding biology: they date back to the origin of life, they are found in virtually every species from cyanobacteria to mammals, and they coordinate many important biological functions from the sleep-wake cycle, to metabolism, and to cognitive functions. Circadian rhythms are equally fundamental for health and medicine: modifications in diet have been linked to modification in circadian rhythms at the molecular level; disruptions of circadian rhythms have been linked to health problems ranging from depression, to learning disorders, to diabetes, to obesity, to cardiovascular disease, to cancer, and to premature ageing; finally, a large fraction of drug targets have been found to oscillate in a circadian manner in one or several tissues, suggesting that a better understanding of circadian oscillations at the molecular level could have direct applications to precision medicine, for instance by optimizing the time at which drugs are taken.  To better understand circadian oscillations at the molecular level, modern high-throughput technologies are being used to measure the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites along the circadian cycle in different organs and tissues, and under different conditions. However, the informatics tools for processing, analyzing, and integrating the growing wealth of molecular circadian data are not yet in place.  This effort will fill this fundamental gap by developing and disseminating informatics tools that will enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental insights about the organization and regulation of circadian oscillations, their roles in health and disease, and their future applications to precision medicine. Specifically, through a close collaborations between computational and experimental scientists, this effort will: (1) Bring the power of deep learning methods to bear on the analyses of omic time series to determine, for instance, which molecular species are oscillating, their characteristics (period, phase, amplitude), and to predict the time/phase associated with a measurement taken at a single time point; (2) Develop Cyber-TC, an extension of the widely used Cyber-T software, for the differential analysis of circadian omic time series and expand MotifMap, a widely used genome-wide map of regulatory sites to better understand circadian regulation; and (3) Develop Circadiomics, an integrated database and web portal as a one-stop shop for circadian data, annotations, and analyses. All data, software, and results will be freely available for academic research purposes and broadly disseminated through multiple channels to benefit both the circadian community and the broader bioinformatics community. Circadian rhythms are fundamental for biology and medicine. Modern high-throughput technologies are revealing how the concentrations of many molecular species, including transcripts, proteins, and metabolites oscillate with the day and night cycle in almost every species, tissue, and cell. In close collaboration with biologists, this project will develop the informatics tools that will enable the collection, integration, and analyses of this wealth of information and lead to novel and fundamental insights about the organization and regulation of circadian oscillations, their roles in health and disease, and their future applications to precision medicine.",Bioinformatics Tools for Circadian Biology,9325275,R01GM123558,"['Address', 'Ally', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Life', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolism', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasticizers', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Proteomics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Site', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'annotation  system', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'direct application', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein metabolite', 'software development', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web portal']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2017,324508,-0.016450022371596495
"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9341177,U24CA199374,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Felis catus', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'annotation  system', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2017,579791,-0.020215818356181754
"Deep learning for representation of codes used for SEER-Medicare claims research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose developing an algorithm and user-friendly software to better identify treatments using Medicare claims data. We will validate our approach using procedures listed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database as a gold standard. In this way, we hope to better match procedures identified using Medicare claims data with SEER listed procedures.  The focus of this research is observational (i.e. non-randomized) data. Well-run randomized clinical trials can provide the best level of evidence of treatment effects. However, randomized trials in the United States have suffered from poor accrual for many interventions. Despite the fact that well-designed randomized clinical trials should be the gold standard, well-designed observational studies might be the only method of obtaining inferences concerning comparative effectiveness for some cancer interventions.  In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked SEER-Medicare database. SEER-Medicare data has provided useful measurements of the effectiveness of a number of cancer therapies. Algorithms for identifying relevant treatment and diagnosis codes using Medicare data are often based on clinical reasoning and scientific evidence. One group of researchers, for example, developed an algorithm for identifying laparoscopic surgery among kidney cancer cases before claims codes for laparoscopic surgery were well developed. While such algorithms are useful for others pursuing similar investigations, there may still be substantial mismatch between treatment identified by the SEER cancer registry and treatment identified through Medicare claims. In this work, we propose developing a rigorous machine learning algorithm that can help researchers in better identifying treatments in Medicare claims data. Specifically, we will design a neural language modeling algorithm and implement a software system that finds vector representations of diagnosis and procedure codes.  We plan on using the neural language modeling algorithm to learn vector representations from SEER- Medicare claims data where related procedure and diagnosis codes are ""neighbors"" (i.e. closely related). We will investigate whether the codes we identify within neighborhoods correspond to the procedure codes used for published SEER-Medicare studies. We will then design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes. Finally, we will investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm by comparing procedures identified using Medicare claims with procedures listed in the SEER database. We will replicate analyses from a published SEER-Medicare paper to investigate if estimated treatment effects differ when using our novel algorithm compared to using the algorithm in the published paper.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In cancer research, one of the most commonly used databases for observational research is the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. To improve the identification of procedures when using Medicare claims data, we will design a software assistant interface that will allow an investigator to explore which codes are related to a given seed of diagnosis or procedure codes.

"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,9145227,R01GM097618,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'international partnership', 'learning strategy', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,539889,-0.03246650249963358
"Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For many years, there has been a concerted effort to automate the analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) rhythms. However, despite significant advances in biomedical signal analysis, there has not been any significant improvement in automated decision support systems. FHR monitoring is now ubiquitous throughout delivery rooms, especially using the non-invasive Doppler monitor, but also using the fetal scalp electrode. Physician classification of fetal heart rate patterns is known to be a non-trivial problem because of significant inter and intra-observer variability of diagnosis. This has led to a marked increase in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby increasing risk to the fetus and mother in many cases. This has further motivated the machine learning community to automate the classification procedure in the interest of accuracy and consistency as well as robustness with respect to noise. Usual approaches to this involve some type of supervised classification procedure, where the algorithm output on training data is compared with a ""gold-standard"" physician classification, followed by testing and validation on new datasets. However, since physician classification can be unreliable in the presence of the aforementioned diagnostic variability, as well as significant tracing noise, we propose the use of unsupervised algorithms to cluster FHR data records into clinically useful categories. We use nonparametric Bayes theory and Markov-time-dependence models for the evolution of feature sequences to propose methods that will achieve improved accuracy. The methods involve extraction of feature sequences from FHR time series data, which are modeled as samples from finite or infinite Dirichlet mixture models. We then use Gibbs sampling to obtain the cluster probabilities for each dataset. Clustering outcomes are compared against direct physician diagnosis and our current results are seen to be in broad agreement with them, while still giving new information on the character of different sub-groups of FHR records. With the proposed research, further gains in classification performance will be made. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fetal heart rate monitoring is now commonly used during childbirth and, at present, physicians read and interpret these data to classify fetal heart rate patterns and make sure that the baby is not in distress during the course of labor. However, there is great variability in how individual doctors interpret the tracings and this has led increases in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby potentially increasing risk to both mothers and babies. Thus there has been a concerted effort from the machine learning community to develop an accurate automatic reading and classification procedure so that correct interpretation of fetal heart rates during labor is more diagnostic and consistent.",Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring,9018050,R21HD080025,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Categories', 'Cesarean section', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Delivery Rooms', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Fetal Heart', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Freedom', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mothers', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'Uncertainty', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'fetal', 'heart rate monitor', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning community', 'pressure', 'stem', 'theories', 'vector']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2016,193120,-0.01823792062358488
"Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine We hypothesize that a flexible, configurable suite of automated informatics tools can reduce significantly the effort needed to generate systematic reviews while maintaining or even improving their quality. To test this hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1. To extend our research on automated RCT tagging to include additional study types and provide public resources. A) Machine learning models will be created that automatically assign probability estimates to three types of observational studies that are widely examined by systematic reviewers. B) The RCT and other taggers will be evaluated prospectively for newly published PubMed articles. C) All PubMed articles will be automatically tagged for RCT, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies and annotated in a public dataset linked to a public query interface. Users will also receive tags for articles from non-PubMed data sources on demand. Aim 2. To evaluate the performance and usability of our tools when used by systematic reviewers under field conditions. A) The tools will be customized and integrated to facilitate field evaluation. B) A three-stage evaluation: 1. Retrospective evaluation of Metta and RCT Tagger performance. 2. Real-time “shadowing”. 3. Prospective controlled study. Aim 3. To identify additional clinical trial articles, appearing after a published systematic review was completed, that are relevant to the review topic. Aim 4. To identify publications related to specific ClinicalTrials.gov registered trials. Aim 5. To develop and evaluate new machine learning methods and tools that will facilitate rapid evidence scoping for new systematic review topics. A) Methods will be developed for ranking articles with respect to their relevance to a proposed new systematic review topic. B) A scoping tool will be created that displays articles ranked by predicted relevance, tagged with study design attributes, sample sizes, and Cochrane risk of bias estimates. The proposed studies will advance the automation of early steps in the process of writing systematic reviews, and thereby enhance evidence-based medicine and the incorporation of best practices into clinical care. Project Narrative Systematic reviews are essential for determining which treatments and interventions are safe and effective. At present, systematic reviews are written largely by laborious manual methods.

"Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design and test mathematically well founded algorithmic and statistical tectonics for analyzing large scale, heterogeneous and noisy data. We focus on fully analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and rigorous statistical guarantees on the analysis results. This project will leverage on the PIs' recent work on cancer genomics data analysis and rigorous data mining techniques. Those works were driven by specific applications, while in the current project we aim at developing general principles and techniques that will apply to a broad sets of applications. The proposed research is transformative in its emphasis on rigorous analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and statistical measures of output uncertainty, in contrast to the primarily heuristic approaches currently used in data ming and machine learning. While we cannot expect full mathematical analysis of all data mining and machine learning techniques, any progress in that direction will have significant contribution to the reliability and scientific impact of this discipline. While ou work is motivated by molecular biology data, we expect the techniques to be useful for other scientific communities with massive multi-variate data analysis challenges. Molecular biology provides an excellent source of data for testing advance data analysis techniques: specifically, DNA/RNA sequence data repositories are growing at a super-exponential rate. The data is typically large and noisy, and it includes both genotype and phenotype features that permit experimental validation of the analysis. One such data repository is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which we will use for initial testing of the proposed approaches. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will advocate a responsible approach to data analysis, based on well-founded mathematical and Statistical concepts. Such an approach enhances the effectiveness of evidence based medicine and other policy and social applications of big data analysis.

"Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image cells or other biological samples. Even for small-scale experiments, the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex, and automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye.  We will continue our development of CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) to meet this strong and growing demand for software to analyze biological images. CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source toolbox. Using its point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized workflow of image-analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. It can extract valuable biological information from images quickly, even for high-throughput experiments, while increasing objectivity and statistical power in microscopy experiments.  Published only seven years ago, CellProfiler is already an important and widely used tool: it is launched 100,000+ times per year by users around the world and has been cited in more than 800 papers from 600 distinct laboratories. The software evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  We propose to improve CellProfiler's capabilities in order to enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler:  First, microscopy experiments are rapidly expanding in both scale and scope, and are beginning to push CellProfiler's limits, particularly when they involve larger images (e.g., for tissue samples, cellular microarrays, large field-of-view cameras), multi-dimensional images (time-lapse and three-dimensional imaging), images for morphological profiling, and novel microscopy types (super-resolution and single-molecule imaging). We will upgrade CellProfiler's capabilities to serve these needs and add proven, state-of-the-art algorithms for image processing (especially segmentation and filtering for non-fluorescence images), time-lapse and 3D analysis, and novel microscopy types. We will also add features and usability improvements requested by the large CellProfiler community.  Second, we will enable researchers to create sophisticated bioimaging analysis workflows by expanding CellProfiler's interoperability with complementary software (e.g., MATLAB, ImageJ, MicroManager, KNIME).  Third, we will disseminate CellProfiler and provide user, educator, and developer support. There is great demand for our online forum, downloadable materials, and in-person tutorials (1,000+ attendees so far).  These improvements to the first, and still preeminent, open-source software for modular, high- throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from microscopy images across all disciplines within biology.

"Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities The complexity of ecological communities creates challenges to understanding multi-host parasite transmission. Pronounced heterogeneity in transmission among individuals, species and across space is the rule rather than the exception. Community ecologists are beginning to make great strides in predicting multi-species interactions using a trait-based rather than taxonomic approach, identifying key functional attributes of organisms and environments that are important to understanding the system. At the same time, disease ecologists generally use network modeling to understand parasite transmission in complex communities. Yet the merging of a trait-based approach with network modeling to understand multi-host transmission across space and time is in its infancy. We will take advantage of a highly tractable system - diverse communities of bees that transmit parasites via networks of flowering plants - to merge trait-based theory with network modeling, introducing a novel theoretical framework for multi-host parasite transmission in complex communities. We will collect empirical contact pattern and trait data from plant-pollinator networks to identify aspects of network structure that contribute to disease spread. Through the collection of extensive data on bee traits, floral traits and parasite spread, we will use machine learning techniques to construct and parameterize trait-based models of disease transmission in order to make falsifiable predictions for further testing. We will then test model predictions via whole-community manipulations of bees, parasites and plants in mesocosms. Such whole-community manipulations will offer unparalleled insight into the specific network patterns and traits that shape transmission in multi-host communities. Pollinators serve a critical role in our native ecosystems as well as agricultural crops, providing billions of dollars in pollination services annually. Recently, parasites have been linked to declines of several pollinator species. Thus, a better understanding of parasite transmission among bees has important conservation and economic implications.",Transmission Networks in Trait-Based Communities,9241579,R01GM122062,"['Address', 'Agricultural Crops', 'Angiosperms', 'Bees', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Organism', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'disease transmission', 'economic implication', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'model building', 'network models', 'novel', 'research study', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'vector']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,409580,-0.027923046680459595
"Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Supervised machine learning is a popular method that uses labeled training examples to predict future outcomes.  Unfortunately, supervised machine learning for biomedical research is often limited by a lack of labeled data.  Current methods to produce labeled data involve manual chart reviews that are laborious and do not scale with data creation rates.  This project aims to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records by forming a crowd of clinical personnel labelers.  The construction of these labeled data sets will allow for new biomedical research studies that were previously infeasible to conduct.  There are numerous practical and theoretical challenges of developing a crowd sourcing platform for clinical data.  First, popular, public crowd sourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk are not suitable for medical record labeling as HIPAA makes clinical data sharing risky.  Second, the types of clinical questions that are amenable for crowd sourcing are not well understood.  Third, it is unclear if the clinical crowd can produce labels quickly and accurately.  Each of these challenges will be addressed in a separate Aim. As the first Aim of this project, the team will evaluate different clinical crowd sourcing architectures.  The architecture must leverage the scale of the crowd, while minimizing patient information exposure.  De-identification tools will be considered to scrub clinical notes t reduce information leakage.  Using this design, the team will extend a popular open source crowd sourcing tool, Pybossa, and release it to the public.  As the second Aim, the team will study the type, structure, topic and specificity of clinical prediction questions, and how these characteristics impact labeler quality.  Lastly, the team will evaluate the quality and accuracy of collected clinical crowd sourced data on two existing chart review problems to determine the platform's utility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traditionally, clinical prediction models rely on supervised machine learning algorithms to probabilistically predict clinical events using labeled medical records.  When data sets are small, manual chart reviews performed by clinical staff are sufficient to label each outcome; however, as data sets have scaled up and researchers aim to study larger cohorts, current manual approaches become intractable.  The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework to crowd source labeled data sets from electronic medical records to support prediction model development.        ",Crowd Sourcing Labels From Electronic Medical Records to Enable Biomedical Research,9076555,UH2CA203708,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Human Resources', 'Incentives', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Audit', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Research', 'Medical Students', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Privacy', 'Productivity', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'member', 'model development', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2016,316000,-0.022881789752336772
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types.

This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,9270103,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'clinical investigation', 'education research', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2016,43143,-0.011807471738220162
"A Machine-Learning Based Software Widget for Resolving Metabolite Identities Owing to recent technological advances in measurement platforms, it is now possible to simultaneously detect and characterize a very large number of metabolites covering a substantial fraction of the small molecules present in a biological sample. This presents an exciting opportunity to develop potentially transformative approaches to study cells and organisms. One major challenge in realizing this potential lies in processing and analyzing the data. A typical dataset from an untargeted experiment contains many of thousands of “features,” each of which could correspond to a unique metabolite. Analyzing such datasets to obtain meaningful biological information depends on reliably and efficiently resolving the chemical identities of the detected features. Currently, in silico fragmentation methods predict candidate metabolites that are scored and ranked based on how well the fragmentation explains the observed MS/MS spectrum, and on other factors influencing fragmentation such as bond dissociation energies and ionization conditions. Deciding which candidate metabolites is the best match for a particular feature in the context of the biological sample, however, is a daunting task. Extensive testing of candidate metabolites against chemical standards library may be prohibitive in terms of cost and efforts. We seek to develop software-enabled workflows centered on resolving metabolite identities. Our approach is to exploit knowledge of the biological context of a sample to identify the metabolites. Recognizing that the metabolites present in a sample result from enzyme-catalyzed biochemical reactions active in the corresponding biological system, we employ topological analysis and inference to best map the metabolites implied by the detected features to metabolic pathways that are feasible based on the genome(s) of cells in the biological system. Aim 1 develops a computational method based on Bayesian-inference to enhance candidate metabolite rankings that are obtained via in silico fragmentation analysis. Our method utilizes all available information (database lookups, in silico fragmentation analysis, and network/pathway context) to maximally inform and adjust the rankings. Aim 2 will build software widgets to implement the metabolite identification workflow within a data-analytics framework. As the analytics framework, we will use Orange, which allows the user to create interactive data analysis pipelines through a plug-and-play graphical user interface (GUI). Aim 3 will validate the computational method and software widget implementation. Experimental validation will utilize high-purity standards to confirm (or reject) the computationally assigned metabolite identities. Widget implementation will be evaluated through a focus group discussion with the widget users in the labs directed by the PIs. As project outcomes, we anticipate both a methodological advance in analyzing mass signature data as well as a suite of easily accessible software in the form of widgets. Metabolomics is concerned with the comprehensive characterization of the small molecule metabolites in biological systems. Owing to recent technological advances in measurement platforms, it is now possible to simultaneously detect and characterize a very large number of metabolites. Prospectively, advanced computational tools and software for metabolomics data analysis can aid discovery efforts aimed at identifying novel bioactive metabolites that could be developed into diagnostic indicators or therapeutic agents. ",A Machine-Learning Based Software Widget for Resolving Metabolite Identities,9223450,R03CA211839,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Oranges', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical standard', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'database query', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'graphical user interface', 'heuristics', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'instrument', 'ionization', 'mass spectrometer', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'software development']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R03,2016,147569,-0.04950792537637056
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases. Its contents have contributed both directly and indirectly to large numbers of basic and translational research studies, and it supports a broad, diverse and engaged user community.

"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,9117645,R00LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'memory process', 'model building', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'neurovascular', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R00,2016,244245,-0.023255580145274422
"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design Our Vision: We propose DeepLink, a versatile data translator that integrate multi-scale, heterogeneous, and multi-source biomedical and clinical data. The primary goal of DeepLink is to enable meaningful bidirectional translation between clinical and molecular science by closing the interoperability gap between models and knowledge at different scales. The translator will enhance clinical science with molecular insights from basic and translational research (e.g. genetic variants, protein interactions, pathway functions, and cellular organization), and enable the molecular sciences by connecting biological discoveries with their pathophysiological consequences (e.g. diseases, signs and symptoms, pharmacological effects, physiological systems). Fundamental differences in the language and semantics used to describe the models and knowledge between the clinical and molecular domains results in an interoperability gap. DeepLink will systematically and comprehensively close this gap. We will begin with the latest technology in semantic knowledge graphs to support an extensible architecture for dynamic data federation and knowledge harmonization. We will design a system for multi-scale model integration that is ontology-based and will combine model execution with prior, curated biomedical knowledge. Our design strategy will be iterative and participatory and anchored by 10 major milestones. In a series of demonstrations of DeepLink’s functions, we will address one of the major challenges facing translational science: reproducibility of biomedical research findings that are based on evolving molecular datasets. Reproducibility of analyses and replication of results are central to scientific advancement. Many landmark studies have used data that are constantly being updated, curated, and pared down over time. Our series of demonstrations projects are designed to prototype the technology required for a scalable and robust translator as well as the techniques we will use to close the interoperability gap for a specific use case. The demonstration project will, itself, will be a significant and novel contribution to science. DeepLink will be able to answer questions that are currently enigmatic. Examples include: - From clinicians: What is the comparative effectiveness of all the treatments for disease Y given a patient's genetic/metabolic/proteomic profile? What are the functional variants in cell type X that are associated with differential treatment outcomes? What metabolite perturbations in cell type Y are associated with different subtypes of disease X? - From basic science researchers: What is known about disease Y across all model organisms (even those not designed to model Y)? What are all the clinical phenotypes that result from a change in function in protein X? Which biological pathways are affected by a pathogenic variant of disease Y? What patient data are available to evaluate a molecularlyderived clinical hypothesis? Challenges and Our Approaches: DeepLink will close the interoperability gap that currently prohibits molecular discoveries from leading to clinical innovations. DeepLink will be technologically driven, addressing the challenges associated with large, heterogeneous, semantically ambiguous, continuously changing, partially overlapping, and contextually dependent data by using (1) scalable, distributed, and versioned graph stores; (2) semantic technologies such as ontologies and Linked Data; (3) network analysis quality control methods; (4) machine-learning focused data fusion methods; (5) context-aware text mining, entity recognition and relation extraction; (6) multi-scale knowledge discovery using patient and molecular data; and (7) presentation of actionable knowledge to clinicians and basic scientists via user-friendly interfaces. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9338982,OT3TR002027,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'molecular domain', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'prototype', 'text searching', 'user-friendly']",NCATS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,OT3,2016,1183132,-0.024540363529119095
"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,9050682,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2016,339750,-0.011792291429498405
"Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Big data"" such as those arising from sequencing, imaging, genomics and other emerging technologies are playing a critical role in modern biology and medicine. The generation of hypotheses about biological processes and disease mechanisms is now increasingly being driven by the production and analysis of large and complex datasets. Advanced computational methods have been developed for the robust analysis of these datasets, and the growth in number and sophistication of these methods has closely tracked the growth in volume and complexity of biomedical data. In such a crowded environment of diverse computational methods and data, it is difficult to judge how generalizable the performance of these methods is from one setting to another. Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have now become popular mechanisms for the rigorous, blinded and unbiased evaluation of the performance of these methods and the identification of best-performing methods for biomedical problems. However, despite the benefits of these challenges to the biomedical research enterprise, the impact of their findings has been remarkably limited in laboratory and clinical settings. This is likely due to two important aspects of current challenges: (i) their over-emphasis on identifying the ""best"" solutions rather than tryig to comprehensively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submitted solutions, and (ii) the absence of a stable channel of communication and collaboration between problem and solution providers due to a lack of sufficient incentives to do so. The aim of this project is to boost the translational impact of scientific challenges through a combination of novel machine learning methods, development of novel scalable software and unique collaborations with disease experts to ensure the effective translation of knowledge accrued in challenges to real clinical settings and practice. These novel methods and software are designed to effectively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submissions to challenges into ""ensemble"" solutions. In a first of its kind effort, the ensemble solutions derived from disease-focused challenges under the DREAM project will be brought directly to scientists and clinicians that are experts in these disease areas. Initial effort in this project will focus on active DREAM challenges aiming at the accurate prediction of drug response and clinical outcomes respectively in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Both these diseases are difficult to treat and thus they pose major medical and public health concerns. In collaboration with RA and AML experts, the ensemble solutions learnt in these challenges will be validated in independent patient cohorts and carefully designed clinical studies. This second-level validation is essential to judge the clinical applicability of any method, but is rarely done As the methodology is general, similar efforts will be made for other diseases in later stages of the project. Overall, using a smart combination of crowdsourcing-based challenges and computational methods and software, we aim to demonstrate a unique pathway for studying and treating disease by truly leveraging the ""wisdom of the crowds"". PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have become a popular mechanism to identify innovative solutions to complex biomedical problems. However, the collective effort of all the challenge participants has been under utilized, and the overall impact on actual clinical and laboratory practice has been remarkably limited.

"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.            ",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9081760,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Population', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'Work', 'age group', 'age related', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2016,428590,-0.013114022665932352
"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design New technologies afford the acquisition of dense “data clouds” of individual humans. However, heterogeneity, dimensionality and multi-scale nature of such data (genomes, transcriptomes, clinical variables, etc.) pose a new challenge: How can one query such dense data clouds of mixed data as an integrated set (as opposed to variable by variable) against multiple knowledge bases, and translate the joint molecular information into the clinical realm? Current lexical mapping and brute-force data mining seek to make heterogeneous data interoperable and accessible but their output is fragmented and requires expertise to assemble into coherent actionable information. We propose DeepTranslate, an innovative approach that incorporates the known actual physical organization of biological entities that are the substrate of pathogenesis into (i) networks (data graphs) and (ii) hierarchies of concepts that span the multiscale space from molecule to clinic. Organizing data sources along such natural structures will allow translation of burgeoning high-dimensional data sets into concepts familiar to clinicians, while capturing mechanistic relationships. DeepTranslate will take a hybrid approach to learn and organize its content from both (i) existing generic comprehensive knowledge sources (GO, KEGG, IDC, etc.) and (ii) newly measured instances of individual data clouds from two demonstration projects: (1) ISB’s Pioneer 100 and (2) St. Jude Lifetime cancer survivors. We will focus on diabetes as test case. These two studies cover a deep biological scale-space and thus can test the full extent of the multiscale capacity of DeepTranslate in a focused application. 1. TYPES OF RESEARCH QUESTION ENABLED. How can a clinician find out that the dozens of “out of range” variables observed in a patient’s data cloud, form a connected set with respect to pathophysiology pathways, from gene to clinical variable? How can the high-dimensional data of studies that measure for each individual 100+ data points of various types (“personal data clouds”) be analyzed as one set in an integrated fashion (as opposed to variable by variable) against existing knowledge bases and also be used to improve the databases? DeepTranslate addresses these two types of questions and thereby will accelerate translation of future personal data clouds into (A) care decisions and (B) hypotheses on new disease mechanisms / treatments, thereby benefiting providers as well as researchers. 2. USE OF EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES. ■ ISB: pioneer in personalized, big-data driven medicine (Demo Project 1); biomedical content expertise; multiscale omics and molecular pathogenesis, big data analysis, housing of databases for public access; query engine designs, GUI. ■ UCSD: leader in biomedical data integration; automated assembly of molecular and clinical data into hierarchical structures; translation between data types ■ U Montreal: biomedical database curation from literature and construction of gene/protein/drug interaction networks; machine learning, open resource database ■ St Jude CRH: Cancer monitoring Demo Project 2, cancer patient data analytics. 3. POTENTIAL DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. (a) Existing comprehensive clinical data sources are not uniform and not explicitly based on biological networks; cross-mapping is being performed at NLM based on lexical relationships: HPO (phenotypes) vs. SNOMED CT (for EMR) vs. IDC or Merck Manual (for diseases). Careful selection of these sources in close collaboration with NLM is needed. (b) Existing molecular pathway databases are static, based on averages of heterogeneous non-stratified populations, while the newly measured high-dimensional data clouds are varied due to intra-individual temporal fluctuation and inter-individual variation. How this will affect building of ontotypes in our hybrid approach, and how large cohorts of data clouds must be to offer statistical power is yet to be determined. Our two Demonstration Projects with their uniquely deep (high-dimensional and multiscale) data in cohorts of limited but growing size are thus crucial first steps in a long journey of collective learning in the TRANSLATOR community. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design,9338977,OT3TR002026,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'CRH gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SNOMED Clinical Terms', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'knowledge base', 'lexical', 'molecular assembly/self assembly', 'new technology', 'transcriptome']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT3,2016,1071976,-0.02764320046384224
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural analysis of large polysaccharides remains challenging in glycobiology. The problem is especially acute when polysaccharides in question are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are large, linear, sulfated polysaccharides ubiquitous to all mammals. Interests in GAG structures stem from GAGs' diverse biological activities that govern phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration, inflammation, blood coagulation and amyloid plaque formation. Abnormal GAG structures have also been associated with the development of a number of diseases, notably cancer and inflammation. As a result, there has been a desire to understand how GAG structures correlate with their biological activities, especially how the distribution of sulfate groups along the chain influence their interactions with GAG-binding proteins. However, GAGs' large size and complex sulfation patterns make analysis of intact GAG chains by conventional ensemble analytical techniques difficult, if not impossible. Here we propose to develop a single molecule sequencer for analysis of polysaccharides using the recognition tunneling nanopore (RTP) device currently under development for ""$1000 genome"" project as a template. With the R21 grant, we will demonstrate the feasibility by carrying out pre-requisite work needed to achieve single molecule sequencing of intact GAG chains using RTP. A RTP device incorporates a nanopore with a tunneling nanogap that contains two electrodes functionalized with recognition molecules capable of forming transient complexes with functional groups on a polymeric chain as it translocates the nanopore, thus generating electrical signals. Single molecule sequencing of GAG chains proposed here circumvents the need to obtain homogeneous samples of GAGs, greatly reducing complexity of sample preparation. GAG analysis by RT devices also does not have the size limitations of most of the existing analytical techniques, and the solid state device planned here are economical to manufacturer and operate. In this application, we aim to carry out pilot studies needed to make GAG sequencing by RTPs feasible: (1) we will investigate the translocation of size defined sulfated GAG fragments through nanopores to optimize the translocation efficiency of GAG ligands as well as to understand the influence of GAG sulfation density and GAG size on their translocation efficiency and speed; (2) we will carry out recognition tunneling experiments on sulfated GAG disaccharides as well as trisaccharides so these signals of GAGs can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify unique signatures needed to detect the presence of these sulfation motifs in longer GAG chains. Completion of these aims will provide all the knowledge required for correct interpretations of RT signals produced by GAG translocation and sets the stage for sequencing of intact GAG chains by RT devices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Work proposed here will allow single molecule sequencing of glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides using an electronic chip with a high speed and low cost for the first time. Glycosaminoglycans have important pharmacological properties and are modulators of critical biological phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration and inflammation. Determination of their sequence structures will allow better understanding of how organisms control these physiological events through glycosaminoglycans.",Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores,9109642,R21GM118339,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Blood coagulation', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Electrons', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Glycobiology', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Imidazole', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Ions', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocyte Trafficking', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mammals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trisaccharides', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional group', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'polysulfated glycosaminoglycan', 'programs', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'stem', 'sugar', 'sulfation', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'tool']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2016,271743,-0.02336538705146773
"Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects. Project Narrative  Low-cost ultrasound probes have the potential to become the stethoscopes of the future and revolutionize in-field and in-hospital patient care. Our goal is to integrate, enhance, and disseminate three cutting edge ultrasound acquisition, analysis, and display toolkits to create a new framework called Slicer+PLUS that will serve as a catalyst for research and product development into low-cost point-of-care ultrasound applications. In particular, our framework will include and facilitate innovative methods for guiding a novice user in ultrasound probe placement and for automatically interpreting ultrasound data to provide a diagnosis, without the user having to interpret a traditional B-mode ultrasound image at any point in the process. The Slicer+PLUS framework will be validated using tasks associated with (a) emergency service personnel performing Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exams at the scene of an accident to detect or rule-out intra-abdominal bleeding; (b) the clinical monitoring of scoliosis progression in children in general practitioners' offices; and (c) the translation of research into regulatory-approved products based on Slicer+PLUS.","Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis",9176982,R01EB021396,"['Abdomen', 'Accidents', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'aging population', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'elastography', 'emergency service responder', 'hospital patient care', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'point of care', 'product development', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'scoliosis', 'signal processing', 'software development', 'transmission process']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2016,677628,-0.01330857296946699
"Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II project aims to continue development of a commercial quality, innovative cloud hosted information management system, called Climb 2.0(tm) that will increase laboratory efficiency and provide improved capabilities for research laboratories. Climb is designed to offer integrated laboratory process management modules that include mobile communications tools data monitoring and alert systems, and integrated access to Microsoft Azure Cloud(tm) Machine Learning and Stream Analytics services. Initially, Climb 2.0 will target animal model research laboratories; however, the core of the platform is designed to be adaptable to nearly any research type or related industry. Current research information management systems are primarily designed as record-keeping tools with little or no direct focus on laboratory efficiency or in enhancing value of the research data. They also do not leverage emergent mobile device technologies, social media frameworks, and data analysis and storage capabilities of cloud computing. Many laboratories still use paper as their primary recording system. Paper data logging is then followed by secondary data entry into a laboratory database. These systems are error prone, time consuming and lead to laboratory databases with significant time lags between data acquisition and data entry. Moreover, they do not recognized cumulative data relationships, which may identify important trends, and researchers often miss windows of opportunity to take action on time-sensitive events. In Phase I, RockStep Solutions demonstrated feasibility of an innovative Cloud Information Management Bundle system, Climb, which will increase efficiency and improve capabilities in animal model data management. During Phase I, a beta version of Climb was successfully developed and tested against strict performance metrics as a proof of concept. We successfully built a prototype with working interfaces that integrates real-time communication technologies with media capabilities of mobile devices. Phase II proposes four specific Aims: 1) Develop the technology infrastructure to support the secure and scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) deployment of Climb for enterprise commercial release; 2) Develop and extend the Phase-I prototype Data Monitoring and Messaging System (DMMS) into a platform ready for production use; 3) Extend Climb's DMMS adding a Stream Analytics engine to support Internet of Things (IoT) devices and streaming media; 4) Deploy a beta release of Climb at partner research labs, test and refine the product for final commercialization. To ensure Climb is developed with functionality and tools relevant to research organizations, RockStep Solutions has established collaborations with key beta sites to test all of the major functionality developed in this proposal. IMPACT: By leveraging emergent technologies and cloud computing, Climb offers several advantages: 1) enables real-time communications using familiar tools among members of research groups; 2) reduces the risk of experimental setbacks, and 3) enables complex experiments to be conducted efficiently.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Invests approximately $12 billion each year in animal model research that is central to both understanding basic biological processes and for developing applications directly related to improving human health. More cost-effective husbandry and colony management techniques, equipment, and new approaches to improve laboratory animal welfare and assure efficient and appropriate research use (e.g., through cost savings and reduced animal burden) are high priorities for NIH. RockStep Solutions proposes to meet this need by integrating existing and emergent software and communication technologies to create a novel solution, Climb 2.0, for research animal data management. Climb 2.0 extracts immediate value of data in animal research laboratories and extends the database into a multimedia communication network, thus enabling science that would be impractical to conduct with traditional methods.        ",Novel Use of Emergent Technologies to Improve Efficiency of Animal Model Research,9138555,R44GM112206,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Welfare', 'Animals', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Information Management', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multimedia', 'Notification', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'animal data', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'design', 'encryption', 'good laboratory practice', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'social media', 'software as a service', 'success', 'time interval', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"ROCKSTEP SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2016,750063,-0.01363864580820614

"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility. This work is relevant to NIH's public health mission by providing a quantitative framework for establishing precision medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases.        ",Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility,9089492,K99GM118907,"['Adjuvant', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Biology', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Resistance', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Peritoneal', 'Peritoneal Fluid', 'Peritoneal lavage', 'Phase', 'Phosphorus', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Source', 'Sulfur', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'bacterial metabolism', 'bactericide', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'counterscreen', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infectious disease treatment', 'insight', 'killings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2016,90000,-0.03441578538896886
"Development of An Integrated High Throughput Imaging and Image Analysis Platform for Muscle ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is growing awareness that weakness of muscle is a significant biomedical health issue associated with many different chronic diseases and aging. There are a variety of different diseases that affect muscle, including muscular dystrophy, fibromyalgia, cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis, each of which carries its own unique set of symptoms, accompanied by a myriad of genetic and molecular abnormalities. There is agreement within the basic research and clinical communities that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber cross sectional area, fiber type, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration, and fibrosis are among many critical factors that determine the health and functionality of the muscle. Until now, the imaging equipment available is relatively low throughput and the quantification is still largely based on manual or, at best, semi-automatic methods that require extensive human intervention. In Phase I, CytoInformatics LLC has developed a software called CytoQuant, which can accurately perform automatic segmentation and provide accurate boundaries of each muscle fiber for a cropped image patch. The goal of CytoInformatics LLC in Phase II is to 1) deliver the first version of the CytoQuant software to the market, 2) develop the second version of CytoQuant by continuously improving its performance, especially in handling large scale, whole slide images, and also 3) develop an integrated multiplexing imaging hardware and analysis software framework as a seamless solution for high throughput, automated image analysis of muscle specimens. After careful investigation in Phase I (please refer to the details in business plan), we conclude that this integrated software/hardware platform with cutting-edge technologies in advanced imaging, large scale machine learning, and big data is commercially attractive to the entire muscle community including research institutes, hospitals, and pharmaceutical and athletic companies, demonstrated by strong enthusiasm among end users and many supporting letters. The specific aims are: 1) Deliver the first version of CytoQuant developed in Phase I to the market, continue to develop the second version of CytoQuant, which will focus on improving the robustness and speed in handling whole slide images; 2) Develop an integrated platform that provides unified imaging hardware and image analysis software to handle whole slide images labeled with multiple bio-relevant markers. This unified whole-slide based software and hardware solution will deliver an efficient and specialized imaging platform that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, multi-marker, and automatic image analysis software specifically designed for muscle.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In Phase II, CytoInformatics is proposing a unified whole-slide multispectral imaging (MSI) system that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, accurate, and automated software to provide fast and efficient, multiplexed imaging and quantitative muscle image analysis simultaneously.

"An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata PROJECT ABSTRACT Biomedical investigators are generating increasing amounts of complex and diverse data. This data varies tremendously, from genome sequences through phenotypic measurements and imaging data. If researchers and data scientists can tap into this data effectively, then we can gain insights into disease mechanisms and how to tackle them. However, the main stumbling block is that it is increasingly hard to find and integrate the relevant datasets due to the lack of sufficient metadata. A researcher studying Crohn's disease may miss a crucial dataset on how certain microbial communities affect gut histology due to the lack of descriptive tags on the data. Currently, applying metadata is difficult, time-consuming and error prone due to the vast sea of confusing and overlapping standards for each datatype. Often specialized `data wranglers' are employed to apply metadata, but even these experts are hindered by lack of good tools. Here we propose to develop an intelligent agent that researchers and data wranglers can use to assist them apply metadata. The agent is based around a personalized dashboard of metadata elements that can be collected from multiple specialized portals, as well as sites such as Wikipedia. These elements can be coupled with classifiers that can be used to self-identify datasets to which they may be relevant, making the selection of appropriate vocabularies easier for researchers. We will deploy the system for a number of targeted use cases, including annotation of the National Center for Biomedical Information Bio-Samples repository, and annotation of images within the Figshare repository. Project Narrative Biomedical data is being generated at an increasing rate, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for researchers to be able to locate and effectively operate over this data, which has negative impacts on the rate of new discoveries. One solution is to attach metadata (data about data) onto all information generated in a research project, but application of metadata is currently difficult and time consuming due to the diverse range of standards on offer, typically requiring the expertise of trained data wranglers. Here we propose to develop an intelligent concept assistant that will allow researchers to generate and share sets of metadata elements relevant to their project, and will use machine learning techniques to automatically apply this to data.",An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata,9161233,U01HG009453,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Frustration', 'Histology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'dashboard', 'empowered', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'insight', 'meetings', 'microbial community', 'peer', 'repository', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,U01,2016,575532,-0.012077838320561984
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus Summary In 2014, the outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses. Several groups had previously performed high throughput screens in 2013 and identified FDA approved drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene) with in vitro growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. We used these compounds to create a computational pharmacophore to identify additional compounds to test in vitro. In addition, data from a published large scale high throughput screen performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute was used to create machine learning models and then subsequently used to score clinical compounds for testing. We have published on how these combined methods identified 3 compounds for testing which were ultimately found to be nM in vitro. One of these compounds is an antimalarial approved in Europe called pyronaridine. We propose to characterize the ADME and PK properties of this compound prior to determining its efficacy in a mouse model of the Ebola virus infection. Therefore the Aims of this R21 proposal will fill some of the gaps inherent in the published data on pyronaridine so far: Aim 1. Perform preclinical in vitro characterization of pyronaridine. Aim 2. Formulate pyronaridine and perform PK studies in mouse. Aim 3. In vitro characterization of pyronaridine against multiple EBOV strains and in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection. The results of these aims will determine go/no go criteria for pursuing larger animal studies in non-human primates prior to clinical studies. In the light of a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a clinical observation that EBOV patients treated with artesunate-amodiaquine had a 31% higher survival rate than those treated with artemether- lumefantrine 2, there will be considerable interest in evaluating antimalarials against Ebola. Our proposal to consider testing the efficacy in the mouse EBOV model using pyronaridine (which is used as artesunate- pyronaridine (Pyramax) and would be readily accessible in the clinic), presents a rapid approach to leverage the aforementioned clinical observations with a more potent compound. Pyronaridine also has additional benefits of tolerability which may be important in this patient population. Narrative Preliminary clinical data showed that Ebola virus (EBOV) patients treated with the antimalarials artesunate- amodiaquine had a higher survival rate than those treated with artemether-lumefantrine, in agreement with the in vitro EC50 for amodiaquine EC50 of 2.6µM. The antimalarial pyronaridine, a structural analog of amodiaquine, was identified by a computational repurposing strategy and further shown to have an EC50 of 420 nM against EBOV in vitro. We now propose to fully characterize this compound using standard preclinical ADME assays prior to mouse pharmacokinetic analysis, determine broad-spectrum applicability against multiple EBOV strains and ultimately in vivo efficacy testing in the mouse Ebola virus model prior to testing in a non-human primate model. Our aim is to show whether Pyronaridine is a viable clinical candidate to treat patients infected with EBOV.",Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus,9204673,R21TR001718,"['Africa', 'Agreement', 'Amodiaquine', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antimalarials', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Babesia', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chloroquine', 'Chloroquine resistance', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clomiphene', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ebola virus', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Erythrocytes', 'Europe', 'European', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Female', 'Filovirus', 'Formulation', 'Growth', 'Half-Life', 'Hour', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Mannich Bases', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Natural Product Drug', 'New England', 'Oral', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Research Institute', 'Route', 'Solubility', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Toremifene', 'Toxic effect', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Inhibitors', 'Vivax Malaria', 'Whole Blood', 'analog', 'artemether', 'artesunate', 'base', 'benflumetol', 'bioactive natural products', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'high throughput screening', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'male', 'mouse model', 'neurotoxicity', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'pharmacophore', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'pyronaridine', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'treatment duration']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R21,2016,288801,-0.009937175862658213
"Hybrid Approaches to Optimizing Evidence Synthesis via Machine Learning and Crowdsourcing Abstract  Systematic reviews constitute the highest quality of evidence and form the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine (EBM). Such reviews now inform everything from national health policy guidelines to bedside care. However, systematic reviews are extremely laborious to produce; researchers can no longer keep pace with the massive amount of evidence now being published.  Semi-automation of systematic review production via machine learning (ML) has demonstrated the potential to substantially reduce reviewer workload while maintaining comprehensiveness. However, it is unlikely that machines will fully supplant human reviewers in the near future. Rather, human experts will probably remain in the loop, assisted by automated methods. Methods that exploit the intersection of human workers and ML models in the context of systematic reviews have not been explored at length. Furthermore, we believe there is substantial untapped potential in harnessing distributed crowd-workers to contribute to systematic reviews, and thus economize expert reviewer efforts. This novel avenue has largely been neglected as a means of increasing the efficiency of review production.  We propose addressing this gap by developing and evaluating novel, hybrid approaches to generating systematic reviews that jointly incorporate domain experts (systematic reviewers), layperson workers recruited via crowdworking platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk and volunteer citizen scientists, while simultaneously capitalizing on ML models.  This innovative, hybrid approach will be the first in-depth exploration of intelligent ML/human systems that aim to reduce the workload in the production of biomedical systematic reviews. Our strong preliminary work demonstrates the promise of this general strategy.   We propose to develop hybrid approaches that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to optimize the conduct of systematic reviews.  ",Hybrid Approaches to Optimizing Evidence Synthesis via Machine Learning and Crowdsourcing,9223968,R03HS025024,[' '],AHRQ,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R03,2016,98635,-0.007539292096089633
"Optimization of small molecule triazine antituberculars for in vivo efficacy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB) is due to infection with the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). This disease represents a global health pandemic as based on WHO statistics it claims the lives of approximately 1.5 million people per year, while infecting nearly 9 million. New drugs are urgently needed with novel mechanisms of action that treat this disease while also addressing an important need to reduce the lengthy course of treatment that is at best 6 months in duration. We have a primary goal of discovering novel classes of antibacterials. (E)-6-(2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinyl)-N2,N4-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (JSF-2019) [1], was rediscovered by us using Bayesian machine learning models in 2013. It represents a class of antitubercular agents reported only once in 1969 [2]. While JSF-2019 did not exhibit in vivo efficacy in an acute model in our hands, a close analog, ((E)-N2,N4-diisopropyl-6-(2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinyl)- 1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (JSF-2032) [2] was reported in 1969 to exhibit in vivo activity. Our preliminary data on solubility in PBS, mouse liver microsomal stability, Caco-2 cell permeability, and mouse snapshot pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles demonstrate that the diaminotriazine class of antituberculars holds significant promise for seeding a novel therapeutic. We aim to further improve upon the in vitro efficacy, in vitro Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of these early compounds. The Specific Aims of this proposed research are: Utilize medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models to optimize the initial triazine hit family as antitubercular agents. Apply transcriptional profiling nd resistant mutant/whole-genome sequencing methods to identify potential drug targets and mechanism of action of the triazine antitubercular class. Phase I would, therefore, seek to deliver an in vivo active small molecule triazine with information as to potential target/s through complimentary methods. A Phase II program would leverage this information to further optimize this series towards a preclinical candidate of significant interest to foundations and/or biotech/pharmaceutical companies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis represents a global health pandemic, which claims the lives of approximately 1.5 million people per year. Starting from a series of triazines active compounds we will optimize ADME properties to afford a novel in vivo active lead compound by combining our unique expertise in medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models. We will also probe the potential target/s of the triazine series.

"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success.

"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data. The Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) will extend and enhance the research capacities and productivity among investigators at the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/AIDS, Alcohol, Aging, and multi-Substance use (COMpAAAS).

"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",9100683,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2016,680020,0.009153263420669393

"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation. n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,9097814,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Internships', 'K-12 student', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'feeding', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroinformatics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'simulation', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,323032,-0.024812682085004267
"Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research Capitalizing on the transformative opportunities afforded by the extremely large and ever-growing volume, velocity, and variety of biomedical data being continuously produced is a major challenge. The development and increasingly widespread adoption of several new technologies, including next generation genetic sequencing, electronic health records and clinical trials systems, and research data warehouses means that we are in the midst of a veritable explosion in data production. This in turn results in the migration of the bottleneck in scientific productivity into data management and interpretation: tools are urgently needed to assist cancer researchers in the assembly, integration, transformation, and analysis of these Big Data sets. In this project, we propose to develop the Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research (SDL-BR) system, a cluster-computing software environment that enables rapid data ingestion, multifaceted data modeling, logical and semantic querying and data transformation, and intelligent resource discovery. SDL-BR is based on the idea of a data lake, a distributed store that does not make any assumptions about the structure of incoming data, and that delays modeling decisions until data is to be used.

"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,9213710,R00AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R00,2016,249000,-0.025710861319496597
"The q-bio Summer School DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems. The complexity and importance of these systems, which govern cellular activities and fates, provides motivation for developing a scientific and engineering workforce equipped to deal with the complexity.",The q-bio Summer School,9002062,R25GM105608,"['Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Career Choice', 'Career Mobility', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Minority-Serving Institution', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Participant', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Professional Competence', 'Qualifying', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biochemical model', 'biological research', 'career', 'career development', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'demographics', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning materials', 'lecture notes', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'model design', 'multidisciplinary', 'peer', 'physical science', 'posters', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NIGMS,"NEW MEXICO CONSORTIUM, INC.",R25,2016,168780,-0.03981064480014354
"Empiric Testing and enhancement of web-based abstract screening tool(Abstrackr) EMPIRICAL TESTING AND ENHANCEMENT OF WEB-BASED ABSTRACT SCREENING TOOL (ABSTRACKR)  In this year-long project, we aim to empirically assess the performance and efficiency of state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine and stakeholder-driven comparative effectiveness reviews. We have developed AbstrackrTM (hereon, Abstrackr), a human-guided computerized abstract screening tool that aims to reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. Abstrackr makes use of machine learning techniques, and is offered as a free web-based tool that enables management of the screening process.  We also aim to revise the web-interface of Abstrackr to make it more intuitive, user friendly, and add documentation and functionalities requested by users; and to revise Abstrackr’s back-end, which includes the way the software parses and analyses citations, fits machine learning models, and makes computations, to make it more efficient. These revisions will ensure that the tool becomes more robust, and that it remains usable for larger projects and for many teams.  The proposed work will be carried out by the developers of Abstrackr, comprising a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators and computer scientists at Brown University and the University of Texas at Austin, who have been working together for at least seven years. We will pursue dissemination of the findings of this assessment and of the revised tool through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its wider adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence-based Practice Center Program, Cochrane Collaboration, and other groups conducting systematic reviews. We will also continue to make all code available online. Our aims are to: Aim 1. Empirically measure the efficiency and accuracy of the prediction algorithms in Abstrackr in the computer-assisted semi-automated screening of citations for eligibility in systematic reviews. Aim 2. Improve and add to the functionality of the Web-based Abstrackr software, based in part on enhancements suggested by a panel of identified heavy users. Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making and systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to assess the performance and efficiency of a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care, and to augment the functionality of its public implementation.",Empiric Testing and enhancement of web-based abstract screening tool(Abstrackr),9168247,R03HS024812,[' '],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2016,99999,-0.005870925515843106
"Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disorder characterized by unrelenting scarring and stiffening of the lungs that leads to the death of an estimated 34,000 individuals in the U.S. each year. Unfortunately, individuals with IPF have extremely limited treatment options, as no effective drugs have been identified to halt the progression of fibrosis. Despite the importance of collagens to the structural organization both normal and remodeled ECM, little is known about how collagen structure in IPF differs from that of normal tissue architecture. There is a clear need to develop highly specific/sensitive techniques to probe collagen structure and organization in IPF tissues. In this project we will implement new collagen specific analyses using the high resolution microscopy technique of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG). This method is sensitive to both the fibrillar organization and also sub-resolution aspects of macro and supramolecular assembly. Here we will utilize SHG microscopy to: 1) determine the how pathologic collagen organization (seen in IPF) differs from normal tissue; 2) identify and quantify areas of active fibrosis (enriched in collagen III) from ""old"" or mature fibrosis (high in collagen I) in IPF lung specimens; 3) assess changes in elastin and collagen distribution during disease progression; and 4) correlate areas of high collagen III/I signal in IPF histologic samples with clinical markers of disease activity. As part of the project, we will develop customized automated machine vision routines to automatically classify tissues in terms of severity. We will specifically focus all of our efforts on studying structure around fibroblastic foci, which will be identified by other microscope modalities. These foci are thought to be at the leading edge of ECM remodeling but the dynamics of their formation in relationship to the overall fibrotic process remain unclear. We hypothesize that these structural changes will serve as label- free biomarkers of IPF and further hypothesize that the collagen is altered specifically around foci in a manner which is associated with disease progression. The information gained may form the basis of future prognostic/diagnostic schemes. We propose 2 Aims: Aim 1 Polarization resolved SHG to determine distribution of Col I/III and other ECM changes in different stages of IPF.  Aim 2. Develop classification system of morphological changes in IPF visualized by SHG. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Narrative Idiopathic fibrosis (IPF) patients have poor survival rates and there is also a lack of diagnostic/prognostic tools that have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to evaluate changes in collagen in the extracellular matrix.

"Supporting Systematic Review Production with Article Similarity Network Visualization PROJECT SUMMARY Systematic reviews (SRs), or systematic reviews of literature, summarize evidence drawn from high quality studies, and are often the preferred source of evidence-based practice (EBP). However, conducting an SR is labor-intensive and time consuming, typically requiring several months to complete. It has been reported that more than ten thousands of SRs are needed to synthesize existing medical knowledge. An Article screening process is one of the most intensive and time consuming steps, which requires SR researchers to screen a large amount of references, ranging from hundreds to more than 10,000 articles, depending on the size of a SR. In the past 10 years, machine learning model training approaches24-29 were developed to accelerate the article selection process through automation. However, they are not widely used due to diffusion challenges.7,14 Major obstacles include 1) a training sample is required to generate the automation algorithm. If the training sample is biased, the article selection process will systematically fail; 2) the automation approach is not made available for non-computer science specialists, therefore SR researchers will not be able to “fine-tune” the automation algorithm for particular conditions in various SR topics; 3) As there is no global automation algorithm, the generalizability is significantly limited; 4) It is difficult to assess the actual workload saved, while finding every relevant article is required in SR. We propose a new approach to provide views of article relationships in an article network. This is different from other bibliometric networks constructing citation, co-author, or co-occurrence networks. Article network is a simple and logical concept: visualizing article relationships and distribution based on articles' similarities in titles, abstracts, keywords, publication types, etc. SR researchers can also alter the article distribution by adjusting the similarities. This approach does not aim to suggest an end-point of the screening process. Rather, it provides a view of distribution for included, excluded, and undecided articles. In the proposed research, we will integrate advanced techniques to sparsify article networks with mixed sparsification methods, and improve the quality and efficiency of large network visualization layouts by constructing a multi-level network structure and advanced force model. We aim to provide approaches to sparsify and visualize article networks with more than 10,000 articles. Our approach is highly generalizable that it can be used for any health science topics. By viewing the article distribution, SR researchers will be able to screen a large amount of literature more efficiently. This approach can be integrated into current SR technologies and used directly by SR researchers. The success of this project can support SR production on any health science topics, and thus streamline their ultimate application in EBP paradigms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Systematic reviews (SRs) provide the highest quality of research evidence for patient care. To accelerate the production of SRs, we will implement advanced visualization techniques to view article relationships and distribution with article networks and in a timely and human readable manner. The success of the project will support SR production and thus streamline their ultimate application to evidence-based practice.",Supporting Systematic Review Production with Article Similarity Network Visualization,9227858,R03HS025047,[' '],AHRQ,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2016,100000,-0.003297327121761825
"Retinal connectome: mobile game and crowdsourcing algorithms for EyeWire II ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An online community called EyeWire proved that volunteers can be motivated to reconstruct neural circuits through an activity resembling a 3D coloring book. EyeWire helped discover space-time speciﬁcity of the wiring from bipolar cells to starburst amacrine cells, which suggested a surprising new model for direction selectivity in the retina. Motivated by this success, we are preparing to launch EyeWire II, which aims to map the entire retinal connectome, yielding the ﬁrst complete wiring diagram for any region of the mammalian CNS. This ambitious goal will require innovative advances in virtually every component of EyeWire. The underlying electron microscopic image of the retina will be replaced by a new image with increased size and quality. A new artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) will be trained using a new software package for 3D deep learning. While the improved AI is expected to reduce the amount of human effort required to reconstruct a neuron, the number of neurons targeted for reconstruction will also increase dramatically. Overall, the absolute amount of human effort required will increase rather than decrease. Therefore it is critical to improve EyeWire's crowdsourcing to (1) mobilize more human effort and (2) to use human effort more efﬁciently. This project aims to radically improve both aspects, thereby making the retinal connectome achievable by EyeWire II. In Aim 1, we will create a compelling mobile game with the target of engaging 10x more people than the existing EyeWire community. In Aim 2, we will develop and deploy new crowdsourcing algorithms that extract wisdom from the crowd by weighted voting and optimally assign players to tasks. The Aims will be achieved through collaboration between three organizations. Wired Differently, Inc. (WD) is a new Boston-based nonproﬁt organization dedicated to ""citizen neuroscience"" that was recently spun out of MIT. WD currently operates EyeWire in collaboration with the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. The Entertainment Technology Center (ETC) at Carnegie Mellon University will offer a project-based class to its master's students to design and prototype new ideas for the mobile game. Both Aims will produce code and algorithms that will be made publicly available, and could have broad impact on citizen science. As the ﬁrst crowdsourcing of 3D image analysis, the code produced by Aim 1 could be useful for the many other kinds of 3D images found in biomedical research. The crowdsourcing algorithms of Aim 2 are potentially useful for any citizen science project facing the challenge of obtaining accurate and reliable results from a heterogeneous group of volunteers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeWire II will increase public understanding of the structure of the nervous system. The retinal connectome could aid those attempting to develop blindness therapies based on regenerating cells and their wiring. It could also aid the development of retinal prosthetics that directly stimulate ganglion cells and computationally emulate the bypassed micro circuitry. 1        ",Retinal connectome: mobile game and crowdsourcing algorithms for EyeWire II,9076876,UH2CA203710,"['Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blindness', 'Books', 'Boston', 'Breathing', 'Bypass', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Love', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Social Interaction', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Volunteer Group', 'Voting', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'connectome', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microscopic imaging', 'neural circuit', 'online community', 'pleasure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'retinal prosthesis', 'simulation', 'starburst amacrine cell', 'success', 'university student', 'visual neuroscience', 'volunteer']",NCI,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,320900,-0.015193057250516562
"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9145647,U24CA199374,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2016,605366,-0.020215818356181754
"Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because of the profound effect of adverse drug events (ADEs) on patient safety, the FDA, AHRQ and Institute of Medicine have flagged post-marketing pharmacovigilance of emerging medications as a high national research priority. The FDA, Foundation for the NIH and PhARMA formed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) to develop and compare methods for identification of ADEs, and the FDA announced its Sentinel Initiative. Congress created the Reagan Udall Foundation (RUF) for the FDA in response to the FDA's own ""FDA Science and Mission at Risk"" report, and two years ago OMOP activities were incorporated into RUF. As the FDA moves forward with its development of Sentinel, including work on Mini-Sentinel, there is a need for researchers around the country to continue to develop better methods, and better evaluation methodologies for those methods. A robust research community working on algorithms for pharmacosurveillance, using electronic health records (EHRs) and claims databases will provide a substrate of ever-improving methods on which the nation's regulatory pharmacovigilance infrastructure can build. Indeed an important motivation of OMOP and Mini-Sentinel was to spur the development of such a community. Machine learning has attracted widespread attention across a range of disciplines for its ability to construct accurate predictive models. Therefore machine learning is especially appropriate for the problems of ADE identification and prediction: identifying ADEs from observational data, and predicting which patients are most at risk of suffering the identified ADE. Our current award has demonstrated the ability of machine learning to address both of these tasks. It has added to the existing evidence that consideration of temporal ordering of events, such as drug exposure and diagnoses, is critical for accuracy in identification and prediction of ADEs. The proposed work seeks to further improve upon these methods by building on recent advances in the field of machine learning, by our group and by others, in graphical model learning and in explicit modeling of irregularly-sampled temporal data. The latter is especially important because observational health databases, such as EHRs and claims databases, are not simple time series. Patients typically do not come into the clinic at regular intervals and have the same labs, vitals, and other measurements in lock step with one another. Building better ADE detection and prediction algorithms cannot be accomplished simply by machine learning research, even if that research is taking account of related work from relevant parts of computer science, statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, pharmaco-epidemiology, and clinical research. Better methods are needed also for evaluation, that is, for estimating how well a new algorithm, or a new use of an existing algorithm, will perform at identifying ADEs associated with a new drug on the market, or at predicting which patients are most at risk of that ADE. More research and evaluation is also needed at the systems level: how can we best construct end-to-end pharmacovigilance systems that sit atop a large observational database and flag potential ADEs for human experts to further investigate? What kinds of information and statistics should such a system provide to the human experts?        This renewal will address the following aims: (1) improve upon machine learning methods for identification and prediction of ADEs, taking advantage of synergies between these two distinct tasks; (2) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE detection, building on advances in machine learning for information extraction from scientific literature; (3) improve upon existing methods for evaluating ADE prediction, building upon advances in machine learning for automated support of phenotyping and also building upon improved methods for efficiently obtaining expert labeling of borderline examples of a phenotype; and (4) use the methods developed in the first three aims to construct and evaluate an end-to-end pharmacosurveillance system integrated with the Marshfield Clinic EHR Data Warehouse. Machine learning plays a central and unifying role throughout all four aims. Our investigator team consists of machine learning researchers with experience in analysis of clinical, genomic, and natural language data (Page, Natarajan), a leading pharmaco-epidemiologist with expertise in building systems to efficiently obtain expert evaluation and labeling of phenotypes (Hansen), a leader in phenotyping from EHR data (Peissig), and an MD/PhD practicing physician with years of experience and leadership in the study of ADEs (Caldwell). In addition to building on results of the prior award, we will build on our experiences with OMOP, the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium, the DARPA Machine Reading Program, and interactions with the FDA.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) carry a high cost each year in life, health and money. Congress, the FDA, the NIH and PhARMA have responded with new initiatives for identifying and predicting occurrences of ADEs. It has been widely recognized within initiatives such as Sentinel and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership that addressing ADEs requires data, standards and methods for data analysis and mining. This proposal addresses the need for new methods for both identifying previously- unanticipated ADEs and predicting occurrences of a known ADE. It also addresses the needs for improved evaluation and integrated systems approaches.            ",Machine Learning for Identifying Adverse Drug Events,8964138,R01GM097618,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse drug event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Exposure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Markov Chains', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'natural language', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2015,608132,-0.03246650249963358
"Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For many years, there has been a concerted effort to automate the analysis of fetal heart rate (FHR) rhythms. However, despite significant advances in biomedical signal analysis, there has not been any significant improvement in automated decision support systems. FHR monitoring is now ubiquitous throughout delivery rooms, especially using the non-invasive Doppler monitor, but also using the fetal scalp electrode. Physician classification of fetal heart rate patterns is known to be a non-trivial problem because of significant inter and intra-observer variability of diagnosis. This has led to a marked increase in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby increasing risk to the fetus and mother in many cases. This has further motivated the machine learning community to automate the classification procedure in the interest of accuracy and consistency as well as robustness with respect to noise. Usual approaches to this involve some type of supervised classification procedure, where the algorithm output on training data is compared with a ""gold-standard"" physician classification, followed by testing and validation on new datasets. However, since physician classification can be unreliable in the presence of the aforementioned diagnostic variability, as well as significant tracing noise, we propose the use of unsupervised algorithms to cluster FHR data records into clinically useful categories. We use nonparametric Bayes theory and Markov-time-dependence models for the evolution of feature sequences to propose methods that will achieve improved accuracy. The methods involve extraction of feature sequences from FHR time series data, which are modeled as samples from finite or infinite Dirichlet mixture models. We then use Gibbs sampling to obtain the cluster probabilities for each dataset. Clustering outcomes are compared against direct physician diagnosis and our current results are seen to be in broad agreement with them, while still giving new information on the character of different sub-groups of FHR records. With the proposed research, further gains in classification performance will be made.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fetal heart rate monitoring is now commonly used during childbirth and, at present, physicians read and interpret these data to classify fetal heart rate patterns and make sure that the baby is not in distress during the course of labor. However, there is great variability in how individual doctors interpret the tracings and this has led increases in the number of caesarean deliveries, thereby potentially increasing risk to both mothers and babies. Thus there has been a concerted effort from the machine learning community to develop an accurate automatic reading and classification procedure so that correct interpretation of fetal heart rates during labor is more diagnostic and consistent.            ",Machine learning with generative mixture models for fetal monitoring,8816208,R21HD080025,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Categories', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Delivery Rooms', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Fetal Heart', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Freedom', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mothers', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'Uncertainty', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'fetal', 'improved', 'interest', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'stem', 'theories', 'vector']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2015,234571,-0.01823792062358488
"Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design and test mathematically well founded algorithmic and statistical tectonics for analyzing large scale, heterogeneous and noisy data. We focus on fully analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and rigorous statistical guarantees on the analysis results. This project will leverage on the PIs' recent work on cancer genomics data analysis and rigorous data mining techniques. Those works were driven by specific applications, while in the current project we aim at developing general principles and techniques that will apply to a broad sets of applications. The proposed research is transformative in its emphasis on rigorous analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and statistical measures of output uncertainty, in contrast to the primarily heuristic approaches currently used in data ming and machine learning. While we cannot expect full mathematical analysis of all data mining and machine learning techniques, any progress in that direction will have significant contribution to the reliability and scientific impact of this discipline. While ou work is motivated by molecular biology data, we expect the techniques to be useful for other scientific communities with massive multi-variate data analysis challenges. Molecular biology provides an excellent source of data for testing advance data analysis techniques: specifically, DNA/RNA sequence data repositories are growing at a super-exponential rate. The data is typically large and noisy, and it includes both genotype and phenotype features that permit experimental validation of the analysis. One such data repository is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which we will use for initial testing of the proposed approaches. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will advocate a responsible approach to data analysis, based on well-founded mathematical and Statistical concepts. Such an approach enhances the effectiveness of evidence based medicine and other policy and social applications of big data analysis. The proposed work will be tested on human and cancer genome data, contributing to health IT, one of the National Priority Domain Areas.

"Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image cells or other biological samples. Even for small-scale experiments, the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex, and automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye.  We will continue our development of CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) to meet this strong and growing demand for software to analyze biological images. CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source toolbox. Using its point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized workflow of image-analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. It can extract valuable biological information from images quickly, even for high-throughput experiments, while increasing objectivity and statistical power in microscopy experiments.  Published only seven years ago, CellProfiler is already an important and widely used tool: it is launched 100,000+ times per year by users around the world and has been cited in more than 800 papers from 600 distinct laboratories. The software evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  We propose to improve CellProfiler's capabilities in order to enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler:  First, microscopy experiments are rapidly expanding in both scale and scope, and are beginning to push CellProfiler's limits, particularly when they involve larger images (e.g., for tissue samples, cellular microarrays, large field-of-view cameras), multi-dimensional images (time-lapse and three-dimensional imaging), images for morphological profiling, and novel microscopy types (super-resolution and single-molecule imaging). We will upgrade CellProfiler's capabilities to serve these needs and add proven, state-of-the-art algorithms for image processing (especially segmentation and filtering for non-fluorescence images), time-lapse and 3D analysis, and novel microscopy types. We will also add features and usability improvements requested by the large CellProfiler community.  Second, we will enable researchers to create sophisticated bioimaging analysis workflows by expanding CellProfiler's interoperability with complementary software (e.g., MATLAB, ImageJ, MicroManager, KNIME).  Third, we will disseminate CellProfiler and provide user, educator, and developer support. There is great demand for our online forum, downloadable materials, and in-person tutorials (1,000+ attendees so far).  These improvements to the first, and still preeminent, open-source software for modular, high- throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from microscopy images across all disciplines within biology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our popular, user-friendly, open-source image analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org), to accommodate the increasing scale and scope of modern microscopy experiments.",Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software,8910751,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slide', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cellular imaging', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2015,589523,-0.012230593828365048
"Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique for searching large libraries of chemical or genetic perturbants, to find new treatments for a disease or to better understand disease pathways. As automated image analysis for cultured cells has improved, microscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to analyze screening samples. However, many diseases and biological pathways can be better studied in whole animals-particularly diseases that involve organ systems and multicellular interactions, such as metabolism and infection. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established and effective model organism, used by thousands of researchers worldwide to study complex biological processes. Samples of C. elegans can be robotically prepared and imaged by high-throughput microscopy, but existing image-analysis methods are insuf- ficient for most assays. In this project, image-analysis algorithms that are capable of scoring high-throughput assays of C. elegans will be developed.  The algorithms will be tested and refined in three high-throughput screens, which will uncover chemical and genetic regulators of fat metabolism and infection: (1) A C. elegans viability assay to identify modulators of infection. The proposed algorithms use a probabilistic shape model of C. elegans in order to identify and mea- sure individual worms even when the animals touch or cross. These methods are the basis for quantifying many other phenotypes, including body morphology and subtle variations in reporter signal levels. (2) A C. elegans lipid assay to identify genes that regulate fat metabolism. The algorithms proposed for illumination correction, level-set-based foreground segmentation, well-edge detection, and artifact removal will result in improved or- business in high-throughput experiments. (3) A fluorescence gene expression assay to identify regulators of the response of the C. elegans host to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The proposed techniques for constructing anatomical maps of C. elegans will make it possible to quantify a variety of changes in fluorescent localization patterns in a biologically relevant way.  In addition to discovering new metabolism- and infection-related drugs and genetic regulators through these specific screens, this work will provide the C. elegans community with (a) a new framework for extracting mor- phological features from C. elegans for quantitative analysis of this organism, and (b) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms enabling the discovery of genetic pathways, chemical probes, and drug can- didates in whole organism high-throughput screens relevant to a variety of diseases.  This work is a close collaboration with C. elegans experts Fred Ausubel and Gary Ruvkun at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with Polina Golland and Tammy Riklin-Raviv, experts in model-based segmentation and statistical image analysis at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and with Anne Carpenter, developer of open-source image analysis software at the Broad Institute. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms. Microscopy screens of cultured cells are routine, but researchers wish to study complex processes like metabolism and infection in a whole animal like the tiny worm Caenorhabditis elegans, for which existing image analysis methods are insufficient. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to automatically identify and measure C. elegans in microscopy images, thereby making it possible for researchers worldwide to screen a wide variety of complex biological processes related to human disease.",Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays,8786567,R01GM095672,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Businesses', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data Quality', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Targeting', 'Excision', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Microsporidia', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Engineering', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'body system', 'chemical genetics', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'follow-up', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'interest', 'lipid metabolism', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'two-dimensional']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2015,309263,-0.013642088617359863
"Automatically Creating and Updating Meta-Studies of Randomized Controlled Trials ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A ""meta-study"" (or ""meta-analysis"") collects and analyzes many studies on the same topic to understand if there is a meaningful, overall result. Meta-studies can support (or refute) interventions, spur new investigations, and lead to novel clinical guidelines. However, constructing meta-studies is a time intensive process of searching the literature, compiling the results, and performing the statistical analysis. Due to the time commitment that is required, many topics are unexplored, and many meta-studies are not kept up-to-date with the latest published results. Finally, a number of (unknown) biases, via subjective choices during the meta-study, may influence the results. Our long-term goal is to automate, as much as possible, the meta-study process. This should decrease subjective bias; increase the dissemination of evidence, especially for diseases and interventions that receive less attention; and allow for the automatic updating of meta-studies as new results are published. We propose a computer system that uses statistical machine learning to gather and group studies focused on similar interventions and outcomes; extract the necessary results from the text; and analyze the results using standard meta-analysis techniques. The final output will be presented in a spreadsheet-like Web-interface where users can explore and even change the data and meta-analyses. Our team uniquely blends technical expertise in machine learning with leadership in publishing meta-studies about Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), our disease of focus for our Phase I feasibility study. We are therefore qualified technically and able to ensure that the techniques generate valid and accurate meta-studies. Our Phase I results will define the current state-of-the-art for this novel task. Further, although we will initially focus n IBD, our Phase I results will demonstrate that our approach can generalize to other diseases, eventually applying to any intervention and any disease. The feasibility shown by our Phase I results will motivate our Phase II effort where we will focus on dramatically improving the approach, yielding broad coverage of all medical literature and generating human-quality meta-studies. We note that by the end of Phase I we should have a viable end-to-end prototype, focused on IBD, which we can begin taking to market. The final product should significantly benefit our target markets given the Phase II emphasis to improve the technology, user experience, and scope of covered diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A meta-analysis collects and analyzes the results from multiple studies that are all focused on the same topic, and it can confirm (or refute) the overall effect across the studies, lead to changes in clinical guidelines, or spur new directions for research. However, generating a meta-analysis is an extremely time-consuming process, so many diseases are not covered, and most meta-analyses are not updated to reflect the latest published studies. This work begins to automate the process of creating meta-analyses, overcoming these difficulties in order to make the results published in the medical literature more accessible.",Automatically Creating and Updating Meta-Studies of Randomized Controlled Trials,8977531,R43LM012210,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dourine', 'Ensure', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Human', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population Sizes', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'prototype', 'software development', 'text searching', 'web interface']",NLM,INFERLINK CORPORATION,R43,2015,150000,-0.00023526280976601192
"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK. The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data. With this grant we will improve these tools, make them more robust, and extend them to new sequencing technologies.

"Reproducibility Assessment for Multivariate Assays DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Small Business Innovation Research project addresses the problem of assessing reproducibility in analyzing high-throughput data. In feature selection for data with large numbers of features, it is well known that some features will appear to affect an outcome by chance, and that subsequent predictions based on these features may not be as successful as initial results would seem to indicate. Similarly, there are often multiple stages, and many parameters, involved in the multivariate assays de- signed to analyze high-throughput profiles. For example, good results achieved with a particular combination of settings for an instance of cross-validation may not generalize to other instances. The objective of this proposal is to extend new statistical methods for assessing reproducibility in replicate experiments to the context of machine learning, and demonstrate effectiveness in this application. The machine-learning methods to be investigated will include random forests, supervised principal components, lasso penalization and support vector machines. We will use simulated and real data from genomic applications to show the potential of this approach for providing reproducibility assessments that are not confounded with prespecified choices, for determining biologically relevant thresholds, for improving the accuracy of signal identification, and for identifying suboptimal results. Relevance. Although today's high-throughput technologies offer the possibility of revolutionizing clinical practice, the analytical tools availble for extracting information from this amount of data are not yet sufficiently developed for targeted exploration of the underlying biology. This project directly addresses the need to make what the FDA terms IVDMIA (In-Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assays) transparent, interpretable, and reproducible, and is thus an opportunity to improve analysis products and services provided to companies that identify, characterize, and validate biomarkers for clinical diagnostics and drug development decision points. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to develop a platform for biomarker discovery and integrative genomic analysis, with reproducibility assessment incorporated into multivariate assays. This will enable evaluation and improvement of approaches to detecting the biological factors that affect a particular outcome, and lead to more efficient and more effective methods for disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and therapeutic drug development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statistical models play a key role in medical research in uncovering information from data that leads to new diagnostics and therapies. However, development of standards for reliability in biomedical data mining has not kept up with the rapid pace at which new data types and modeling approaches are being devised.

"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.            ",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,8935748,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'clinical investigation', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2015,73173,-0.011807471738220162
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,8920669,R00LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'memory process', 'model building', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R00,2015,239130,-0.023255580145274422
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases. Its contents have contributed both directly and indirectly to large numbers of basic and translational research studies, and it supports a broad, diverse and engaged user community.

"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8842639,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2015,332955,-0.011792291429498405
"Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Big data"" such as those arising from sequencing, imaging, genomics and other emerging technologies are playing a critical role in modern biology and medicine. The generation of hypotheses about biological processes and disease mechanisms is now increasingly being driven by the production and analysis of large and complex datasets. Advanced computational methods have been developed for the robust analysis of these datasets, and the growth in number and sophistication of these methods has closely tracked the growth in volume and complexity of biomedical data. In such a crowded environment of diverse computational methods and data, it is difficult to judge how generalizable the performance of these methods is from one setting to another. Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have now become popular mechanisms for the rigorous, blinded and unbiased evaluation of the performance of these methods and the identification of best-performing methods for biomedical problems. However, despite the benefits of these challenges to the biomedical research enterprise, the impact of their findings has been remarkably limited in laboratory and clinical settings. This is likely due to two important aspects of current challenges: (i) their over-emphasis on identifying the ""best"" solutions rather than tryig to comprehensively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submitted solutions, and (ii) the absence of a stable channel of communication and collaboration between problem and solution providers due to a lack of sufficient incentives to do so. The aim of this project is to boost the translational impact of scientific challenges through a combination of novel machine learning methods, development of novel scalable software and unique collaborations with disease experts to ensure the effective translation of knowledge accrued in challenges to real clinical settings and practice. These novel methods and software are designed to effectively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submissions to challenges into ""ensemble"" solutions. In a first of its kind effort, the ensemble solutions derived from disease-focused challenges under the DREAM project will be brought directly to scientists and clinicians that are experts in these disease areas. Initial effort in this project will focus on active DREAM challenges aiming at the accurate prediction of drug response and clinical outcomes respectively in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Both these diseases are difficult to treat and thus they pose major medical and public health concerns. In collaboration with RA and AML experts, the ensemble solutions learnt in these challenges will be validated in independent patient cohorts and carefully designed clinical studies. This second-level validation is essential to judge the clinical applicability of any method, but is rarely done As the methodology is general, similar efforts will be made for other diseases in later stages of the project. Overall, using a smart combination of crowdsourcing-based challenges and computational methods and software, we aim to demonstrate a unique pathway for studying and treating disease by truly leveraging the ""wisdom of the crowds"".         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have become a popular mechanism to identify innovative solutions to complex biomedical problems. However, the collective effort of all the challenge participants has been under utilized, and the overall impact on actual clinical and laboratory practice has been remarkably limited. Using novel computational methods and novel ""big data""-friendly software implementation, we plan to demonstrate how biomedical challenges, combined with our approach, can influence clinical practice in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Rheumatoid Arthritis, as well as rigorously validate our approach.                 ",Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning,8864679,R01GM114434,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Design', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'design', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge translation', 'meetings', 'method development', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'stem', 'tool']",NIGMS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2015,445887,-0.03149081327745001
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, significant progress was made in 3D imaging of macromolecular assemblies via electron microscopy and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting volumetric maps to atomic-resolution structures. The overall goal of the proposed research is to further develop computational fitting and validation tools for electron microscopy (EM). We intend to establish new modeling, visualization, and simulation techniques that would serve as bridges between atomic structures and EM densities. The proposed multi-scale software will aid in the routine determination of large-scale structures of biomolecular assemblies and in the validation of structural models that will be deposited to public databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the EM Data Bank (EMDB). Key questions to be addressed include the following: (i) How can one improve, validate, and disseminate well-established matching algorithms for intermediate-resolution (8-15 Å) cryo-electron microscopy? (ii) How can one accurately identify and segment geometric features of subcellular assemblies in low-resolution (4-5 nm) cryo-electron tomograms or in focused ion beam milling of resin-embedded specimen blocks? (iii) Given the recent increase in resolution achieved with direct detection cameras, how can one systematically characterize high-resolution (2-10 Å) density patterns and validate atomic models based on local signatures in the data? We will adapt a new modeling paradigm for these studies, namely simultaneous refinement of multiple subunits. This approach is based on a ""systems"" perspective because biological assemblies exhibit ""emergent behavior"" in the spatial domain, that is, the whole is more than the sum of its parts. The new paradigm, in combination with docking protocols, improves model accuracy and opens the door to new global fitting applications in the above three areas. In addition, we will use statistical analysis and machine learning of local signatures to complement the global strategies. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, chromatin fibers, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project helps biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels from atomic to living organism-level. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems. The results of our fundamental research will be new computer codes for modeling macromolecular assemblies, the structures of which facilitate the prediction of medically relevant functions.            ",Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy,8964685,R01GM062968,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin Fiber', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Filaments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Filament', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hair Cells', 'Health', 'Heating', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Motors', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Plant Resins', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Stereocilium', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tomogram', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'base', 'computer code', 'cryogenics', 'density', 'design', 'fitness', 'fundamental research', 'high standard', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'macromolecular assembly', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tomography', 'tool']",NIGMS,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,307928,-0.032162212586451445
"Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural analysis of large polysaccharides remains challenging in glycobiology. The problem is especially acute when polysaccharides in question are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are large, linear, sulfated polysaccharides ubiquitous to all mammals. Interests in GAG structures stem from GAGs' diverse biological activities that govern phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration, inflammation, blood coagulation and amyloid plaque formation. Abnormal GAG structures have also been associated with the development of a number of diseases, notably cancer and inflammation. As a result, there has been a desire to understand how GAG structures correlate with their biological activities, especially how the distribution of sulfate groups along the chain influence their interactions with GAG-binding proteins. However, GAGs' large size and complex sulfation patterns make analysis of intact GAG chains by conventional ensemble analytical techniques difficult, if not impossible. Here we propose to develop a single molecule sequencer for analysis of polysaccharides using the recognition tunneling nanopore (RTP) device currently under development for ""$1000 genome"" project as a template. With the R21 grant, we will demonstrate the feasibility by carrying out pre-requisite work needed to achieve single molecule sequencing of intact GAG chains using RTP. A RTP device incorporates a nanopore with a tunneling nanogap that contains two electrodes functionalized with recognition molecules capable of forming transient complexes with functional groups on a polymeric chain as it translocates the nanopore, thus generating electrical signals. Single molecule sequencing of GAG chains proposed here circumvents the need to obtain homogeneous samples of GAGs, greatly reducing complexity of sample preparation. GAG analysis by RT devices also does not have the size limitations of most of the existing analytical techniques, and the solid state device planned here are economical to manufacturer and operate. In this application, we aim to carry out pilot studies needed to make GAG sequencing by RTPs feasible: (1) we will investigate the translocation of size defined sulfated GAG fragments through nanopores to optimize the translocation efficiency of GAG ligands as well as to understand the influence of GAG sulfation density and GAG size on their translocation efficiency and speed; (2) we will carry out recognition tunneling experiments on sulfated GAG disaccharides as well as trisaccharides so these signals of GAGs can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify unique signatures needed to detect the presence of these sulfation motifs in longer GAG chains. Completion of these aims will provide all the knowledge required for correct interpretations of RT signals produced by GAG translocation and sets the stage for sequencing of intact GAG chains by RT devices.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Work proposed here will allow single molecule sequencing of glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides using an electronic chip with a high speed and low cost for the first time. Glycosaminoglycans have important pharmacological properties and are modulators of critical biological phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration and inflammation. Determination of their sequence structures will allow better understanding of how organisms control these physiological events through glycosaminoglycans.            ",Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores,8984813,R21GM118339,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Blood coagulation', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Electrons', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Glycobiology', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imidazole', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Ions', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocyte Trafficking', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mammals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trisaccharides', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional group', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'polysulfated glycosaminoglycan', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'stem', 'sugar', 'sulfation', 'tool']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2015,273816,-0.02336538705146773
"KnowEng, a Scalable Knowledge Engine for Large-Scale Genomic Data-OVERALL DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds). The KnowEng environment will be deployed in a cloud infrastructure and fully available to the community, as will be the software developed by the Center. The proposed Center is a collaboration between the University of Illinois (UIUC), a recognized world leader in computational science and engineering, and the Mayo Clinic, one of the leading clinical care and research organizations in the worid, and will be based at the UIUC Institute for Genomic Biology, which has state-of-the-art facilities and a nationally recognized program of multidisciplinary team-based genomic research.

"KnowEng, a Scalable Knowledge Engine for Large-Scale Genomic Data-OVERALL     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds). The KnowEng environment will be deployed in a cloud infrastructure and fully available to the community, as will be the software developed by the Center. The proposed Center is a collaboration between the University of Illinois (UIUC), a recognized world leader in computational science and engineering, and the Mayo Clinic, one of the leading clinical care and research organizations in the worid, and will be based at the UIUC Institute for Genomic Biology, which has state-of-the-art facilities and a nationally recognized program of multidisciplinary team-based genomic research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physicians and biologists are now routinely producing very large, genome-wide datasets.

"Protect Privacy of Healthcare Data in the Cloud DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cloud computing is gain popularity due to its cost-effective storage and computation. There are few studies on how to leverage cloud computing resources to facilitate healthcare research in a privacy preserving manner. This project proposes an advanced framework that combines rigorous privacy protection and encryption techniques to facilitate healthcare data sharing in the cloud environment. Comparing to traditional centralized data anonymization, we are facing major challenges such as lack of global knowledge and the difficulty to enforce consistency. We adopt differential privacy as our privacy criteria and will leverage homomorphic encryption and Yao's garbled circuit protocol to build secure yet scalable information exchange to overcome the barrier. Project narrative Sustainability and privacy are critical concerns in handling large and growing healthcare data. New challenges emerge as new paradigms like cloud computing become popular for cost-effective storage and computation. This project will develop an advanced framework to combine rigorous privacy protection and encryption techniques to facilitate healthcare data sharing in the cloud environment.",Protect Privacy of Healthcare Data in the Cloud,8925916,R21LM012060,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Laplacian', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Trust', 'Work', 'base', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data sharing', 'encryption', 'light weight', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'privacy protection', 'research study', 'tool']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2015,192613,-0.006944894093205471
"BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ideally, as neuroscientists collect terabytes of image stacks, the data are automatically processed for open access and analysis. Yet, while several labs around the world are collecting data at unprecedented rates- up to terabytes per day-the computational technologies that facilitate streaming data-intensive computing remain absent. Also deploying data-intensive compute clusters is beyond the means and abilities of most experimental labs. This project will extend, develop, and deploy such technologies. To demonstrate these tools, we will utilize them in support of the ongoing mouse brain architecture (MBA) project, which already has amassed over 0.5 petabytes (PBs) of image data. The main computational challenges posed by these datasets are ones of scale. The tasks that follow remain relatively stereotyped across acquisition modalities. Until now, labs collecting data on this scale have been almost entirely isolated, left to ""reinvent the wheel"" for each of these problems. Moreover, the extant solutions are insufficient for a number of reasons: they often include numerous excel spreadsheets that rely on manual data entry, they lack scalable scientific database backends, and they run on ad hoc clusters not specifically designed for the computational tasks at hand. We aim to augment the current state of the art by implementing the following technological advancements into the MBA project pipeline: (1) Data Management will consist of a unified system that automatically captures metadata, launches processing pipelines, and provides quality control feedback in minutes instead of hours. (2) Data Processing tasks will run algorithms ""out-of-core"", appropriate for their computational requirements, including registration, alignment, and semantic segmentation of cell bodies and processes. (3) Data Storage will automatically build databases for storing multimodal image data and extracted annotations learned from the machine vision algorithms. These databases will be spatially co-registered and stored on an optimized heterogeneous compute cluster. (4) Data Access will be automatically available to everyone-including all the image data and data derived products-via Web-services, including 3D viewing, downloading, and further processing. (5) Data Analytics will extend random graph models suitable for multiscale circuit graphs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Nervous system disorders are responsible for approximately 30% of the total burden of illness in the United States. Whole brain neuroanatomy-available from massive neuroscientific image stacks-is widely believed to be a key missing link in our ability to prevent and treat such illnesses. Thus, this project aims to close this gap via the development and application of BIGDATA tools for management, storage, access, and analytics. n/a",BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci,8792208,R01DA036400,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Cell physiology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Feedback', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Mus', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Running', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Stereotyping', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States', 'Vision', 'burden of illness', 'cluster computing', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized data processing', 'data management', 'design', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal cell body', 'prevent', 'tool', 'web services']",NIDA,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2015,248295,-0.02244684896634441
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.            ",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9019135,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bathing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'micro-total analysis system', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2015,804679,-0.016458896120070985
"Heterogeneous and Robust Survival Analysis in Genomic Studies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to develop powerful and computationally-efficient statistical methods for statistical modeling of high-dimensional genomic data motivated by important biological problems and experiments. The specific aims of the current project include developing novel survival analysis methods to model the heterogeneity in both patients and biomarkers in genomic studies and developing robust survival analysis methods to analyze high-dimensional genomic data.

"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.                ","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",8975906,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peer', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2015,727692,0.009153263420669393

"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation. n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,8920676,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'feeding', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'simulation', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,323033,-0.024812682085004267

"The q-bio Summer School DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems. The complexity and importance of these systems, which govern cellular activities and fates, provides motivation for developing a scientific and engineering workforce equipped to deal with the complexity.",The q-bio Summer School,8802880,R25GM105608,"['Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Career Choice', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Minority-Serving Institution', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Participant', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Qualifying', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biochemical model', 'biological research', 'career', 'career development', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'demographics', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'interest', 'lecture notes', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'model design', 'multidisciplinary', 'peer', 'physical science', 'posters', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NIGMS,"NEW MEXICO CONSORTIUM, INC.",R25,2015,169997,-0.03981064480014354
"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,8775624,K99AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2015,90000,-0.025710861319496597
"Informatic tools for predicting an ordinal response for high-dimensional data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. Examples include scoring methods for liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, including the Knodell hepatic activity index, the Ishak score, and the METAVIR score. In addition, tumor-node-metasis stage for cancer patients is an ordinal scaled measure. Moreover, the more recently advocated method for evaluating response to treatment in target tumor lesions is the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors method, with ordinal outcomes defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Traditional ordinal response modeling methods assume independence among the predictor variables and require that the number of samples (n) exceed the number of covariates (p). These are both violated in the context of high-throughput genomic studies. Recently, penalized models have been successfully applied to high-throughput genomic datasets in fitting linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models with excellent performance. However, extension of penalized models to the ordinal response setting has not been fully described nor has software been made generally available. Herein we propose to apply the L1 penalization method to ordinal response models to enable modeling of common ordinal response data when a high-dimensional genomic data comprise the predictor space. This study will expand the scope of our current research by providing additional model-based ordinal classification methodologies applicable for high-dimensional datasets to accompany the heuristic based classification tree and random forest ordinal methodologies we have previously described. The specific aims of this application are to: (1) Develop R functions for implementing the stereotype logit model as well as an L1 penalized stereotype logit model for modeling an ordinal response. (2) Empirically examine the performance of the L1 penalized stereotype logit model and competitor ordinal response models by performing a simulation study and applying the models to publicly available microarray datasets. (3) Develop an R package for fitting a random-effects ordinal regression model for clustered ordinal response data. (4) Extend the random-effects ordinal regression model to include an L1 penalty term to accomodate high-dimensional covariate spaces and empirically examine the performance of the L1random-effects ordinal regression model through application to microarray data. Studies involving protocol biopsies where both histopathological assessment and microarray studies are performed at the same time point are increasingly being performed, so that the methodology and software developed in this application will provide unique informatic methods for analyzing such data. Moreover, the ordinal response extensions proposed in this application, though initially conceived of by considering microarray applications, will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect human preference data and other responses on an ordinal scale. Most histopathological variables are reported on an ordinal scale.

"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements.

"Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disorder characterized by unrelenting scarring and stiffening of the lungs that leads to the death of an estimated 34,000 individuals in the U.S. each year. Unfortunately, individuals with IPF have extremely limited treatment options, as no effective drugs have been identified to halt the progression of fibrosis. Despite the importance of collagens to the structural organization both normal and remodeled ECM, little is known about how collagen structure in IPF differs from that of normal tissue architecture. There is a clear need to develop highly specific/sensitive techniques to probe collagen structure and organization in IPF tissues. In this project we will implement new collagen specific analyses using the high resolution microscopy technique of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG). This method is sensitive to both the fibrillar organization and also sub-resolution aspects of macro and supramolecular assembly. Here we will utilize SHG microscopy to: 1) determine the how pathologic collagen organization (seen in IPF) differs from normal tissue; 2) identify and quantify areas of active fibrosis (enriched in collagen III) from ""old"" or mature fibrosis (high in collagen I) in IPF lung specimens; 3) assess changes in elastin and collagen distribution during disease progression; and 4) correlate areas of high collagen III/I signal in IPF histologic samples with clinical markers of disease activity. As part of the project, we will develop customized automated machine vision routines to automatically classify tissues in terms of severity. We will specifically focus all of our efforts on studying structure around fibroblastic foci, which will be identified by other microscope modalities. These foci are thought to be at the leading edge of ECM remodeling but the dynamics of their formation in relationship to the overall fibrotic process remain unclear. We hypothesize that these structural changes will serve as label- free biomarkers of IPF and further hypothesize that the collagen is altered specifically around foci in a manner which is associated with disease progression. The information gained may form the basis of future prognostic/diagnostic schemes. We propose 2 Aims: Aim 1 Polarization resolved SHG to determine distribution of Col I/III and other ECM changes in different stages of IPF.  Aim 2. Develop classification system of morphological changes in IPF visualized by SHG.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Narrative Idiopathic fibrosis (IPF) patients have poor survival rates and there is also a lack of diagnostic/prognostic tools that have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to evaluate changes in collagen in the extracellular matrix. The methods developed here will improve upon these limitations and may lay the groundwork for eventual non- invasive in vivo imaging.            ",Second Harmonic Generation analysis of the ECM in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,8969087,R21HL126190,"['Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cessation of life', 'Cicatrix', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Collagen', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elastin', 'Equilibrium', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Hamman-Rich syndrome', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lung', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'base', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'public health relevance', 'second harmonic', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2015,218370,-0.015497216899848242
"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.                ","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",8970326,U24CA199374,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2015,606305,-0.020215818356181754
"Intelligent and Automatic Image Segmentation Software for High ThroughputAnalysi     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well established that aging and many chronic diseases, such as cancer and heart failure, are associated with significant losses in skeletal muscle mass and strength in humans. There is agreement across the muscle biology community that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber area, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration and fibrosis are critical factors that determine the health and function of the muscle. However, at this time, quantification of muscle characteristics from standard histological and immunohistological techniques is still a manual or, at best, a semi-automatic process. This process is labor intensive and can be prone to errors, leading to high inter-observer variability. On the other hand, when muscle characteristics are calculated by computer-aided image analysis, data acquisition times decrease and objectivity improves significantly. The objective of this Phase I STTR project is to build a fully automatic, intelligent, and high throughput image acquisition and analysis software for quantitative muscle morphological analysis on digitized muscle cross-sections. We propose to utilize the most recent technical advances in machine learning and biomedical image analysis. This includes a newly developed deformable model and mean-shift based seed detection algorithm for better segmentation accuracy; an asymmetric online boosting based machine learning algorithm which allows the software to learn from errors and adjust its segmentation strategies adaptively; and a data parallelization schema using the graphic processing unit (GPU) to handle the computational bottleneck for extremely large scale image, such as whole slide scanned specimens. We believe that this software, equipped with the most advanced technical innovations, will be commercially attractive for the skeletal muscle research community including basic scientists, clinician scientists, and the pharmaceutical industry. The specific aim are: 1) Develop, implement, and validate an automatic biological image analysis software package for skeletal muscle tissue; 2) Develop a novel online updated intelligent artificial intelligence unit to enable the software to learn from errors; 3) Build a novel high performance computing unit to enable fast and high throughput automatic image analysis, which is capable of processing whole slide scanned muscle specimens. The analysis approach proposed will provide more consistent, accurate, and objective quantification of skeletal muscle morphological properties and the time for data analysis will be reduced by over a factor of 100 for standalone version and 2000 for parallel version. The long-term goal of Cytoinformatics, LLC for the Phase II stage is to apply the software to analyze histology/pathology from human muscle biopsy samples and extension of the software to other biological tissues, such as adipose tissue.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Important features of muscle fibers, such as fiber area, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration and fibrosis are critical factors that determine the health of the muscle. However quantification of muscle features from digitized images is still a manual or, at best, a semi-automatic process.

"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the next-generation sequencing analysis tools, and thereby allowing biomedical researchers to take full advantage of next-generation sequencing to study biology and disease.            ",Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing,8683213,R01HG006870,"['Algorithms', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bruck-de Lange syndrome', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cholesterol', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Internet', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cohesin', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'xenopus development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2014,221252,-0.023285937145262076
"Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design and test mathematically well founded algorithmic and statistical tectonics for analyzing large scale, heterogeneous and noisy data. We focus on fully analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and rigorous statistical guarantees on the analysis results. This project will leverage on the PIs' recent work on cancer genomics data analysis and rigorous data mining techniques. Those works were driven by specific applications, while in the current project we aim at developing general principles and techniques that will apply to a broad sets of applications. The proposed research is transformative in its emphasis on rigorous analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and statistical measures of output uncertainty, in contrast to the primarily heuristic approaches currently used in data ming and machine learning. While we cannot expect full mathematical analysis of all data mining and machine learning techniques, any progress in that direction will have significant contribution to the reliability and scientific impact of this discipline. While ou work is motivated by molecular biology data, we expect the techniques to be useful for other scientific communities with massive multi-variate data analysis challenges. Molecular biology provides an excellent source of data for testing advance data analysis techniques: specifically, DNA/RNA sequence data repositories are growing at a super-exponential rate. The data is typically large and noisy, and it includes both genotype and phenotype features that permit experimental validation of the analysis. One such data repository is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which we will use for initial testing of the proposed approaches. This project will advocate a responsible approach to data analysis, based on well-founded mathematical and Statistical concepts. Such an approach enhances the effectiveness of evidence based medicine and other policy and social applications of big data analysis.

"Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopes to image cells or other biological samples. Even for small-scale experiments, the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex, and automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye.  We will continue our development of CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org) to meet this strong and growing demand for software to analyze biological images. CellProfiler is a versatile, open-source toolbox. Using its point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized workflow of image-analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. It can extract valuable biological information from images quickly, even for high-throughput experiments, while increasing objectivity and statistical power in microscopy experiments.  Published only seven years ago, CellProfiler is already an important and widely used tool: it is launched 100,000+ times per year by users around the world and has been cited in more than 800 papers from 600 distinct laboratories. The software evolves in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  We propose to improve CellProfiler's capabilities in order to enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler:  First, microscopy experiments are rapidly expanding in both scale and scope, and are beginning to push CellProfiler's limits, particularly when they involve larger images (e.g., for tissue samples, cellular microarrays, large field-of-view cameras), multi-dimensional images (time-lapse and three-dimensional imaging), images for morphological profiling, and novel microscopy types (super-resolution and single-molecule imaging). We will upgrade CellProfiler's capabilities to serve these needs and add proven, state-of-the-art algorithms for image processing (especially segmentation and filtering for non-fluorescence images), time-lapse and 3D analysis, and novel microscopy types. We will also add features and usability improvements requested by the large CellProfiler community.  Second, we will enable researchers to create sophisticated bioimaging analysis workflows by expanding CellProfiler's interoperability with complementary software (e.g., MATLAB, ImageJ, MicroManager, KNIME).  Third, we will disseminate CellProfiler and provide user, educator, and developer support. There is great demand for our online forum, downloadable materials, and in-person tutorials (1,000+ attendees so far).  These improvements to the first, and still preeminent, open-source software for modular, high- throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from microscopy images across all disciplines within biology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our popular, user-friendly, open-source image analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org), to accommodate the increasing scale and scope of modern microscopy experiments.            ",Continued Development of CellProfiler Cell Image Analysis Software,8761195,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slide', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cellular imaging', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2014,522488,-0.012230593828365048
"Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique for searching large libraries of chemical or genetic perturbants, to find new treatments for a disease or to better understand disease pathways. As automated image analysis for cultured cells has improved, microscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to analyze screening samples. However, many diseases and biological pathways can be better studied in whole animals-particularly diseases that involve organ systems and multicellular interactions, such as metabolism and infection. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established and effective model organism, used by thousands of researchers worldwide to study complex biological processes. Samples of C. elegans can be robotically prepared and imaged by high-throughput microscopy, but existing image-analysis methods are insuf- ficient for most assays. In this project, image-analysis algorithms that are capable of scoring high-throughput assays of C. elegans will be developed.  The algorithms will be tested and refined in three high-throughput screens, which will uncover chemical and genetic regulators of fat metabolism and infection: (1) A C. elegans viability assay to identify modulators of infection. The proposed algorithms use a probabilistic shape model of C. elegans in order to identify and mea- sure individual worms even when the animals touch or cross. These methods are the basis for quantifying many other phenotypes, including body morphology and subtle variations in reporter signal levels. (2) A C. elegans lipid assay to identify genes that regulate fat metabolism. The algorithms proposed for illumination correction, level-set-based foreground segmentation, well-edge detection, and artifact removal will result in improved or- business in high-throughput experiments. (3) A fluorescence gene expression assay to identify regulators of the response of the C. elegans host to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The proposed techniques for constructing anatomical maps of C. elegans will make it possible to quantify a variety of changes in fluorescent localization patterns in a biologically relevant way.  In addition to discovering new metabolism- and infection-related drugs and genetic regulators through these specific screens, this work will provide the C. elegans community with (a) a new framework for extracting mor- phological features from C. elegans for quantitative analysis of this organism, and (b) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms enabling the discovery of genetic pathways, chemical probes, and drug can- didates in whole organism high-throughput screens relevant to a variety of diseases.  This work is a close collaboration with C. elegans experts Fred Ausubel and Gary Ruvkun at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with Polina Golland and Tammy Riklin-Raviv, experts in model-based segmentation and statistical image analysis at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and with Anne Carpenter, developer of open-source image analysis software at the Broad Institute.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms. Microscopy screens of cultured cells are routine, but researchers wish to study complex processes like metabolism and infection in a whole animal like the tiny worm Caenorhabditis elegans, for which existing image analysis methods are insufficient. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to automatically identify and measure C. elegans in microscopy images, thereby making it possible for researchers worldwide to screen a wide variety of complex biological processes related to human disease.

"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.        The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data. With this grant we will improve these tools, make them more robust, and extend them to new sequencing technologies. This is essential to realize the potential of DNA sequencing to understand human history, diversity, and to discover  new loci associated with human disease, leading to new biologic hypotheses and new drug targets.

"ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major problem addressed in this proposal is the development and evaluation of an automated noninvasive approach to discriminate different normal and pathological tissue types using machine learning algorithms; previous applications of machine learning have been based on features of the backscattered ultrasound that are essentially energy based. Our approach will be based on extracting features from images whose pixels are determined by the entropy contained in segments of the backscattered ultrasound. The unique attributes of entropy imaging suggest that the automated analysis we propose would be particularly robust for discrimination of deep tissues in a clinical environment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All skilled clinical practitioners and interpreters of ultrasound studies realize that much information exists in recorded US images that is processed immediately by the visual cortex and is useful for qualitatively defining pathology, yet defies ready quantification by any robust algorithm. Traditional energy-based representations display grayscale intensities and speckle patterns that have been mapped parametrically into various tissue classification schemes that have yet to demonstrate organ or tissue specificity, although progress has been reported in distinguishing pathologies over the last 30 years. However, the fact that US signal processing and representation of backscatter data in terms of energy functions has not changed over the last 50 years suggests that alternative signal processing schemes may be indicated to represent the richness of the information contained within the backscattered data. To meet this challenge, we have been involved over the past 10 years in processing backscattered RF to create ""information"" images and in designing ""information sensitive"" approaches to classifying the data sets based on statistical analysis of these images These novel and user independent metrics utilize the entropy of windowed segments of radiofrequency (RF) backscatter signal from tis- sue, which represents a radical departure from grayscale or speckle metrics. In this approach the entropy of the backscattered segment is used to produce a pixel value in the tissue image. This processing strategy has proven to be sensitive to weak, sub-resolution sized changes in tissue.

"GPU COMPUTING RESOURCE TO ENABLE INNOVATION IN IMAGING AND NETWORK BIOLOGY     DESCRIPTION:  Many complex diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and schizophrenia may be understood as failures in the functioning of nested hierarchies of biomolecular and cellular networks. These nested hierarchies control a range of processes including the differentiation and migration of cells, remodeling of extracellular matrices and tissues, and information encoding in neuronal subsystems. Washington University has established expertise in cutting edge imaging, molecular biology and genomic technologies synergistic with computational approaches such as machine learning and unraveling the principles of hierarchical organization and dynamics of complex systems. This collective expertise is being leveraged to develop new drugs, improve our ability to interpret sophisticated imaging data, understand how populations of neurons act collectively to accomplish complex tasks, and model the onset and progression of complex diseases as dynamical rewiring of hierarchical, multi-scale networks. Biological network analyses provide a rich set of tools for organizing and interpreting the vast quantities of data produced by state-of-the-art experimental protocols. The rapid advancement of computationally intensive research in these areas is outstripping the capabilities of CPU-based high performance computing (HPC) systems. This application would support the acquisition and integration of a large-scale IBM high performance cluster of Graphics Processor Units (GPUs) to be added as an upgrade to the existing IBM-designed Heterogeneous High Performance Computing environment to form a state-of-the-art hybrid computing capability. Such a resource is essential to match the growing need for high performance computing at Washington University and to support state of the art research software applications that are optimized for GPU computing. The acquisition and integration of a high performance GPU cluster will solve critical computing challenges that exist within Washington University's growing NIH research portfolio. The proposed state-of-the-art hybrid GPU/CPU computing capabilities will be deployed within the framework of a stable, productive and rapidly growing resource center. The addition of high-capacity GPU computing capabilities will allow critical calculation to be performed in hours instead of days and enable substantial increases in productivity for existing projects covering a broad range of application areas as well as enabling new research directions.             n/a",GPU COMPUTING RESOURCE TO ENABLE INNOVATION IN IMAGING AND NETWORK BIOLOGY,8640341,S10OD018091,"['Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Failure', 'Genomics', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'cell motility', 'computing resources', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'tool']",OD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,S10,2014,597700,0.007058894621095883
"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.        The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.

"Reproducibility Assessment for Multivariate Assays  Project Summary. This Small Business Innovation Research project addresses the problem of assessing reproducibility in analyzing high-throughput data. In feature selection for data with large numbers of fea- tures, it is well known that some features will appear to affect an outcome by chance, and that subsequent predictions based on these features may not be as successful as initial results would seem to indicate. Similarly, there are often multiple stages, and many parameters, involved in the multivariate assays de- signed to analyze high-throughput profiles. For example, good results achieved with a particular combina- tion of settings for an instance of cross-validation may not generalize to other instances. The objective of this proposal is to extend new statistical methods for assessing reproducibility in replicate experiments to the context of machine learning, and demonstrate effectiveness in this application. The machine-learning methods to be investigated will include random forests, supervised principal components, lasso penal- ization and support vector machines. We will use simulated and real data from genomic applications to show the potential of this approach for providing reproducibility assessments that are not confounded with prespecified choices, for determining biologically relevant thresholds, for improving the accuracy of signal identification, and for identifying suboptimal results. Relevance. Although today's high-throughput technologies offer the possibility of revolutionizing clinical practice, the analytical tools available for extracting information from this amount of data are not yet sufficiently developed for targeted exploration of the underlying biology. This project directly addresses the need to make what the FDA terms IVDMIA (In-Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assays) transparent, interpretable, and reproducible, and is thus an opportunity to improve analysis products and services provided to companies that identify, characterize, and validate biomarkers for clinical diagnostics and drug development decision points. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to develop a platform for biomarker discovery and integrative genomic analysis, with reproducibility assessment incorporated into multivariate assays. This will enable evaluation and improvement of approaches to detecting the biological factors that affect a particular outcome, and lead to more efficient and more effective methods for disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and therapeutic drug development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statistical models play a key role in medical research in uncovering information from data that leads to new diagnostics and therapies. However, development of standards for reliability in biomedical data mining has not kept up with the rapid pace at which new data types and modeling approaches are being devised. This proposal is for new methods for quantifying reproducibility in biomedical data analyses that will have a far-reaching impact on public health by streamlining protocols, reducing costs and offering more effective clinical support systems.            ",Reproducibility Assessment for Multivariate Assays,8647816,R43GM109503,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Support System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug development', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel diagnostics', 'public health relevance', 'research study']",NIGMS,INSILICOS,R43,2014,131071,-0.014757876553866895
"The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The biomedical sciences are being radically transformed by advances in our ability to monitor, record, store and integrate information characterizing human biology and health at scales that range from individual molecules to large populations of subjects. This wealth of information has the potential to substantially advance both our understanding of human biology and our ability to improve human health. Perhaps the most central and general approach for exploiting biomedical data is to use methods from machine learning and statistical modeling to infer predictive models. Such models take as input observable data representing some object of interest, and produce as output a prediction about a particular, unobservable property of the object. This approach has proven to be of high value for a wide range of biomedical tasks, but numerous significant challenges remain to be solved in order for the full potential of predictive modeling to be realized.  To address these challenges, we propose to establish The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping (CPCP). Our proposed center will focus on a broad range of problems that can be cast as computational phenotyping. Although some phenotypes are easily measured and interpreted, and are available in an accessible format, a wide range of scientifically and clinically important phenotypes do not satisfy these criteria. In such cases, computational phenotyping methods are required either to (i) extract a relevant  phenotype from a complex data source or collection of heterogeneous data sources, (ii) predict clinically  important phenotypes before they are exhibited, or (iii) do both in the same application.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop innovative new approaches and tools that are able to discover, and make crucial inferences with large data sets that include molecular profiles, medical images, electronic health records, population-level data, and various combinations of these and other data types. These approaches will significantly advance the state of the art in wide range of biological and clinical investigations, such as predicting which patients are most at risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and severe blood clots.            ",The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping-1 Overall,8774800,U54AI117924,"['Address', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Blood coagulation', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,U54,2014,73173,-0.011807471738220162
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.          RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases.

"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8653848,R01NS075314,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Couples', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'complex biological systems', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'electron optics', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web interface']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,436094,-0.00662054395186956
"A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a pre-commercial prototype system capable of continuously monitoring involuntary movement disorders from a wide spectrum of neurological conditions. The impact of this innovation will enhance the availability of advanced brain and behavior research tools [PA- 11-134] by providing a continuous means of tracking the presence and severity of movement disorders during normal daily activities. This project will transform our unique movement disorder recognition algorithms into custom software that analyzes movement disorders for specific neurological conditions. The information obtained from body worn sensors will provide an accurate and objective means for assessing the complex and changeable nature of movement disorders. This goal cannot by realized using the current method of self-report questionnaires.  The research strategy for Phase I will establish the merit and feasibility of this effort by developing an Application Generation (AG) software platform using a framework of configurable signal processing modules to generate custom applications for movement disorder analysis (Aim 1). This approach reduces the effort and enhances the flexibility of designing and testing software solutions for these applications. The AG Platform will be developed using C++ software to implement signal processing and machine-learning software modules that operate within a knowledge-based framework that we have previously developed. In Aim 2 we will utilize the AG platform to generate movement disorder analysis software to evaluate a challenging test-case application: freezing-of-gait in Parkinson's disease (PD). The goal is to attain performance metrics for freezing that are comparable to those we have achieved for tremor and dyskinesia in previous efforts.  Phase II will refine the capabilities of the AG platform developed in Phase I. We will augment it with the means to automatically design and train the machine learning algorithms, improve the user-interface, and provide options for viewing and summarizing the results. The improved AG platform will be used to develop customized disorder-analysis software that encompasses the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD (e.g. dystonia, bradykinesia, Parkinsonian gait, tremor, dyskinesia), as well as for other neurological condition, such as Essential Tremor (ET). Firmware will be developed for each custom application to efficiently integrate the analytic software with our existing Trigno wireless sensor data acquisition hardware, which needs to be streamlined for this application. This combined system will be evaluated under research use-case scenarios in Neurology. Phase II will deliver an ambulatory Movement Disorder Monitoring system that not only succeeds in providing state-of-the-art monitoring solutions for PD and Essential Tremor, but has proven technology to develop monitoring solutions for a wide variety of neurological conditions. Future development will transfer this technology to a clinical version of this system.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project is intended to improve the accuracy and reduce the burden of researchers and clinicians when assessing motor outcomes for patients with involuntary movement disorders. The proposed technology will provide a means for evaluating new treatment options, and expedite the delivery of care. The attainment of these goals should increase the effectiveness of research, the time required for these research advancements to reach the consumer, and help control the rising costs of clinical care among the estimated 45 million Americans who have neurological disorders resulting in involuntary movements. The resulting improvements in motor function will ultimately lead to greater independence and productivity for this growing segment of the population.

"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.                ",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8652462,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'public health relevance']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2014,332955,-0.011792291429498405
"Scalable Biomedical Pattern Recognition Via Deep Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patterns extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and other biomedical datasets can provide valuable feedback to a learning healthcare system, but our ability to find them is limited by certain manual steps. The dominant approach to finding the patterns uses supervised learning, where a computational algorithm searches for patterns among input variables (or features) that model an outcome variable (or label). This usually requires an expert to specify the learning task, construct input features, and prepare the outcome labels. This workflow has served us well for decades, but the dependence on human effort prevents it from scaling and it misses the most informative patterns, which are almost by definition the ones that nobody anticipates. It is poorly suited to the emerging era of population-scale data, in which we can conceive of massive new undertakings such as surveiling for all emerging diseases, detecting all unanticipated medication effects, or inferring the complete clinical phenotype of all genetic variants.      The approach of unsupervised feature learning overcomes these limitations by identifying meaningful patterns in massive, unlabeled datasets with little or no human involvement. While there is a large literature on feature creation, a new surge of interest in unsupervised methods is being driven by the recent development of deep learning, in which a compact hierarchy of expressive features is learned from large unlabeled datasets. In the domains of image and speech recognition, deep learning has produced features that meet or exceed (by as much as 70%) the previous state of the art on difficult standardized tasks.      Unfortunately, the noisy, sparse, and irregular data typically found in an EMR is a poor substrate for deep learning. Our approach uses Gaussian process regression to convert such an irregular sequence of observations into a longitudinal probability density that is suitable for use with a deep architecture. With this approach, we can learn continuous unsupervised features that capture the longitudinal structure of sparse and irregular observations. In our preliminary results unsupervised features were as powerful (0.96 AUC) in an unanticipated classification task as gold-standard features engineered by an expert with full knowledge of the domain, the classification task, and the class labels.      In this project we will learn unsupervised features for records of all individuals in our deidentifed EMR image, for each of 100 laboratory tests and 200 medications of relevance to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We will evaluate the features using three pattern recognition tasks that were unknown to the feature-learning algorithm: 1) an easy supervised classification task of distinguishing diabetics vs. nondiabetics, 2) a much more difficult task of distinguishing type 1 vs. type 2 diabetics, and 3) a genetic association task that considers the features as micro-phenotypes and measures their association with 29 different single nucleotide polymorphisms with known associations to type 1 or type 2 diabetes.             Every piece of data generated in the course of medical care can provide crucial feedback to a learning healthcare system, but only if relevant patterns can be found among them.

"KnowEng, a Scalable Knowledge Engine for Large-Scale Genomic Data-OVERALL     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface.

"Building an open-source cloud-based computational platform to improve data access   We propose to develop a novel, cost-effective, cloud-based data and analytics platform that will provide efficient data storage solutions and enhanced analytics, annotation and reporting capabilities for supporting and accelerating clinical and molecular research in the treatment of substance use disorders (SUD). This open source platform, which leverages existing BioDX technology, will provide a centralized, multi-user environment that enables and encourages collaborative research and information dissemination among team members.  One of the unmet infrastructural challenges of modern molecular research is the availability of computational platforms that allow the management of large databases, easy access to data, the availability of powerful customizable tools for data mining, analysis and visualization, and integration of different data sources to allow successful analysis of complex data problems. Such problems are commonplace in high- throughput molecular research. This proposal aims to fill this gap by developing a robust platform that integrates state-of-the-art open-source technologies for data storage, data access, data mining and analysis, annotation, visualization and reporting.  We previously developed a cloud-based BioDatomics platform for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), BioDX, which has been successful and has been used commercially by several clients. This proposal aims to develop a new platform leveraging our experience with the BioDX platform that integrates: data storage and real-time data querying using Cloudera Impala; powerful and customizable analytics tools using R and its derivative Bioconductor suite of programs for bioinformatics; annotation integration and reporting which is an existing feature of BioDX; and a visual programming interface that will simplify and enhance the development and maintenance of reproducible analytics workflows. We believe this powerful integrated data platform, if successful, will enable real-time collaboration, dramatically reduce data repository costs, and increase the efficiency and efficacy of data analyses for translating experimental data into actionable research products.  We are committed to analyzing stakeholder needs and optimizing hardware, software and information technology systems to meet their demands. This platform will enhance stakeholder capabilities for developing, implementing and testing various models for substance addiction, risky behavior, discovery of molecular targets for treatment, genomic profiling of patients and other relevant scientific questions. Users will have access to modern statistical, machine learning, data mining and visualization tools.  The initial phase of work will involve development of the platform, optimizing performance on the cloud and testing the integration of new technology. BioDatomics is committed to funding the next phase of work which will include usability testing and finalizing a commercial product, following which full commercialization will proceed. Preliminary commercialization plans have demonstrated that the project has the capacity to generate a million dollars in revenue during the first full year after commercial release.  The ultimate beneficiaries of this platform will be government agencies, academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies pursuing collaborative projects to discover treatments for substance abuse disorders. This open source platform will enable significant savings to the end users in terms of data storage and analytic capabilities, and promises to have a major impact in increasing the success of molecular, clinical and translational research for substance abuse disorders.

"BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ideally, as neuroscientists collect terabytes of image stacks, the data are automatically processed for open access and analysis. Yet, while several labs around the world are collecting data at unprecedented rates- up to terabytes per day-the computational technologies that facilitate streaming data-intensive computing remain absent. Also deploying data-intensive compute clusters is beyond the means and abilities of most experimental labs. This project will extend, develop, and deploy such technologies. To demonstrate these tools, we will utilize them in support of the ongoing mouse brain architecture (MBA) project, which already has amassed over 0.5 petabytes (PBs) of image data. The main computational challenges posed by these datasets are ones of scale. The tasks that follow remain relatively stereotyped across acquisition modalities. Until now, labs collecting data on this scale have been almost entirely isolated, left to ""reinvent the wheel"" for each of these problems. Moreover, the extant solutions are insufficient for a number of reasons: they often include numerous excel spreadsheets that rely on manual data entry, they lack scalable scientific database backends, and they run on ad hoc clusters not specifically designed for the computational tasks at hand. We aim to augment the current state of the art by implementing the following technological advancements into the MBA project pipeline: (1) Data Management will consist of a unified system that automatically captures metadata, launches processing pipelines, and provides quality control feedback in minutes instead of hours. (2) Data Processing tasks will run algorithms ""out-of-core"", appropriate for their computational requirements, including registration, alignment, and semantic segmentation of cell bodies and processes. (3) Data Storage will automatically build databases for storing multimodal image data and extracted annotations learned from the machine vision algorithms. These databases will be spatially co-registered and stored on an optimized heterogeneous compute cluster. (4) Data Access will be automatically available to everyone-including all the image data and data derived products-via Web-services, including 3D viewing, downloading, and further processing. (5) Data Analytics will extend random graph models suitable for multiscale circuit graphs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Nervous system disorders are responsible for approximately 30% of the total burden of illness in the United States. Whole brain neuroanatomy-available from massive neuroscientific image stacks-is widely believed to be a key missing link in our ability to prevent and treat such illnesses. Thus, this project aims to close this gap via the development and application of BIGDATA tools for management, storage, access, and analytics.              n/a",BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci,8631080,R01DA036400,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Cell physiology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Feedback', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Mus', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Running', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Stereotyping', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States', 'Vision', 'burden of illness', 'cluster computing', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized data processing', 'data management', 'design', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal cell body', 'prevent', 'tool', 'web services']",NIDA,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2014,250003,-0.02244684896634441

"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation.             n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,8697162,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'feeding', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'simulation', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,333533,-0.024812682085004267

"The q-bio Summer School     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology.

"Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through  multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defective neurotransmission is the cause of many neurological diseases ranging from depression to autism. Understanding the regulators of synaptic strength can shed light on pathways that play a role in establishing healthy synaptic function, and treatments for neurotransmission-related diseases.",Elucidating Synaptic Regulators via High-Throughput Morphology Characterization,8618418,K99AG046911,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institution', 'Ion Channel', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'career development', 'cognitive function', 'excitatory neuron', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'neurotransmitter release', 'neurotransmitter uptake', 'normal aging', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'synaptic function', 'technology development', 'tissue fixing', 'tool']",NIA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2014,90000,-0.025710861319496597
"Informatic tools for predicting an ordinal response for high-dimensional data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. Examples include scoring methods for liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, including the Knodell hepatic activity index, the Ishak score, and the METAVIR score. In addition, tumor-node-metasis stage for cancer patients is an ordinal scaled measure. Moreover, the more recently advocated method for evaluating response to treatment in target tumor lesions is the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors method, with ordinal outcomes defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Traditional ordinal response modeling methods assume independence among the predictor variables and require that the number of samples (n) exceed the number of covariates (p). These are both violated in the context of high-throughput genomic studies. Recently, penalized models have been successfully applied to high-throughput genomic datasets in fitting linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models with excellent performance. However, extension of penalized models to the ordinal response setting has not been fully described nor has software been made generally available. Herein we propose to apply the L1 penalization method to ordinal response models to enable modeling of common ordinal response data when a high-dimensional genomic data comprise the predictor space. This study will expand the scope of our current research by providing additional model-based ordinal classification methodologies applicable for high-dimensional datasets to accompany the heuristic based classification tree and random forest ordinal methodologies we have previously described. The specific aims of this application are to: (1) Develop R functions for implementing the stereotype logit model as well as an L1 penalized stereotype logit model for modeling an ordinal response. (2) Empirically examine the performance of the L1 penalized stereotype logit model and competitor ordinal response models by performing a simulation study and applying the models to publicly available microarray datasets. (3) Develop an R package for fitting a random-effects ordinal regression model for clustered ordinal response data. (4) Extend the random-effects ordinal regression model to include an L1 penalty term to accomodate high-dimensional covariate spaces and empirically examine the performance of the L1random-effects ordinal regression model through application to microarray data. Studies involving protocol biopsies where both histopathological assessment and microarray studies are performed at the same time point are increasingly being performed, so that the methodology and software developed in this application will provide unique informatic methods for analyzing such data. Moreover, the ordinal response extensions proposed in this application, though initially conceived of by considering microarray applications, will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect human preference data and other responses on an ordinal scale.               Most histopathological variables are reported on an ordinal scale.

"Informatics to enable routine personalized cancer therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic analysis of individual patients is now affordable and therapies targeted to specific molecular aberrations are being tested in clinical trials. However, even highly-specialized physicians at leading academic centers are not equipped to apply genomic information available in publically available sources to clinical- decision-making concerning individual patients. Our central hypothesis is that we can develop informatics tools to support personalized cancer treatment as ""standard of care"" rather than ""one off"" exceptions. We will: 1) implement a bioinformatics pipeline for processing molecular data into actionable profiles, 2) create and maintain a database of therapeutic implications of common genomic aberrations using automated processing of publically-available sources and 3) develop tools to summarize and present patient-specific advice to clinicians. These tools will be based on existing technologies and publicly available data sources. Once tested, we will make these tools available via appropriate open source license.

"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements.

"Intelligent and Automatic Image Segmentation Software for High ThroughputAnalysi     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well established that aging and many chronic diseases, such as cancer and heart failure, are associated with significant losses in skeletal muscle mass and strength in humans. There is agreement across the muscle biology community that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber area, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration and fibrosis are critical factors that determine the health and function of the muscle. However, at this time, quantification of muscle characteristics from standard histological and immunohistological techniques is still a manual or, at best, a semi-automatic process. This process is labor intensive and can be prone to errors, leading to high inter-observer variability. On the other hand, when muscle characteristics are calculated by computer-aided image analysis, data acquisition times decrease and objectivity improves significantly. The objective of this Phase I STTR project is to build a fully automatic, intelligent, and high throughput image acquisition and analysis software for quantitative muscle morphological analysis on digitized muscle cross-sections. We propose to utilize the most recent technical advances in machine learning and biomedical image analysis. This includes a newly developed deformable model and mean-shift based seed detection algorithm for better segmentation accuracy; an asymmetric online boosting based machine learning algorithm which allows the software to learn from errors and adjust its segmentation strategies adaptively; and a data parallelization schema using the graphic processing unit (GPU) to handle the computational bottleneck for extremely large scale image, such as whole slide scanned specimens. We believe that this software, equipped with the most advanced technical innovations, will be commercially attractive for the skeletal muscle research community including basic scientists, clinician scientists, and the pharmaceutical industry. The specific aim are: 1) Develop, implement, and validate an automatic biological image analysis software package for skeletal muscle tissue; 2) Develop a novel online updated intelligent artificial intelligence unit to enable the software to learn from errors; 3) Build a novel high performance computing unit to enable fast and high throughput automatic image analysis, which is capable of processing whole slide scanned muscle specimens. The analysis approach proposed will provide more consistent, accurate, and objective quantification of skeletal muscle morphological properties and the time for data analysis will be reduced by over a factor of 100 for standalone version and 2000 for parallel version. The long-term goal of Cytoinformatics, LLC for the Phase II stage is to apply the software to analyze histology/pathology from human muscle biopsy samples and extension of the software to other biological tissues, such as adipose tissue.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Important features of muscle fibers, such as fiber area, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration and fibrosis are critical factors that determine the health of the muscle.

"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the next-generation sequencing analysis tools, and thereby allowing biomedical researchers to take full advantage of next-generation sequencing to study biology and disease.            ",Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing,8518436,R01HG006870,"['Algorithms', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bruck-de Lange syndrome', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cholesterol', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Internet', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cohesin', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'xenopus development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2013,220626,-0.023285937145262076
"Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design and test mathematically well founded algorithmic and statistical tectonics for analyzing large scale, heterogeneous and noisy data. We focus on fully analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and rigorous statistical guarantees on the analysis results. This project will leverage on the PIs' recent work on cancer genomics data analysis and rigorous data mining techniques. Those works were driven by specific applications, while in the current project we aim at developing general principles and techniques that will apply to a broad sets of applications. The proposed research is transformative in its emphasis on rigorous analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and statistical measures of output uncertainty, in contrast to the primarily heuristic approaches currently used in data ming and machine learning. While we cannot expect full mathematical analysis of all data mining and machine learning techniques, any progress in that direction will have significant contribution to the reliability and scientific impact of this discipline. While ou work is motivated by molecular biology data, we expect the techniques to be useful for other scientific communities with massive multi-variate data analysis challenges. Molecular biology provides an excellent source of data for testing advance data analysis techniques: specifically, DNA/RNA sequence data repositories are growing at a super-exponential rate. The data is typically large and noisy, and it includes both genotype and phenotype features that permit experimental validation of the analysis. One such data repository is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which we will use for initial testing of the proposed approaches. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will advocate a responsible approach to data analysis, based on well-founded mathematical and Statistical concepts. Such an approach enhances the effectiveness of evidence based medicine and other policy and social applications of big data analysis.

"Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique for searching large libraries of chemical or genetic perturbants, to find new treatments for a disease or to better understand disease pathways. As automated image analysis for cultured cells has improved, microscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to analyze screening samples. However, many diseases and biological pathways can be better studied in whole animals-particularly diseases that involve organ systems and multicellular interactions, such as metabolism and infection. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established and effective model organism, used by thousands of researchers worldwide to study complex biological processes. Samples of C. elegans can be robotically prepared and imaged by high-throughput microscopy, but existing image-analysis methods are insuf- ficient for most assays. In this project, image-analysis algorithms that are capable of scoring high-throughput assays of C. elegans will be developed.  The algorithms will be tested and refined in three high-throughput screens, which will uncover chemical and genetic regulators of fat metabolism and infection: (1) A C. elegans viability assay to identify modulators of infection. The proposed algorithms use a probabilistic shape model of C. elegans in order to identify and mea- sure individual worms even when the animals touch or cross. These methods are the basis for quantifying many other phenotypes, including body morphology and subtle variations in reporter signal levels. (2) A C. elegans lipid assay to identify genes that regulate fat metabolism. The algorithms proposed for illumination correction, level-set-based foreground segmentation, well-edge detection, and artifact removal will result in improved or- business in high-throughput experiments. (3) A fluorescence gene expression assay to identify regulators of the response of the C. elegans host to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The proposed techniques for constructing anatomical maps of C. elegans will make it possible to quantify a variety of changes in fluorescent localization patterns in a biologically relevant way.  In addition to discovering new metabolism- and infection-related drugs and genetic regulators through these specific screens, this work will provide the C. elegans community with (a) a new framework for extracting mor- phological features from C. elegans for quantitative analysis of this organism, and (b) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms enabling the discovery of genetic pathways, chemical probes, and drug can- didates in whole organism high-throughput screens relevant to a variety of diseases.  This work is a close collaboration with C. elegans experts Fred Ausubel and Gary Ruvkun at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with Polina Golland and Tammy Riklin-Raviv, experts in model-based segmentation and statistical image analysis at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and with Anne Carpenter, developer of open-source image analysis software at the Broad Institute.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms. Microscopy screens of cultured cells are routine, but researchers wish to study complex processes like metabolism and infection in a whole animal like the tiny worm Caenorhabditis elegans, for which existing image analysis methods are insufficient. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to automatically identify and measure C. elegans in microscopy images, thereby making it possible for researchers worldwide to screen a wide variety of complex biological processes related to human disease.

"Brain Science Computer Cluster     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational requirements of contemporary brain science research often exceed financial and resource management limits of individual investigator laboratories. Many contemporary neuroscience research projects require analysis of large data sets with advanced statistical methods and anatomical reconstruction techniques. These methods require high speed computational and graphics engines operating in a multiple processor environments equipped with large capacity, high-speed storage devices. A limitation in the Brown brain science effort at understanding neural processing is the lack of a readily accessible high-speed computational resource. A central computational resource based on a unified cluster of contemporary Linux CPUs and GPUs will serve the computational needs of a core group of brain science investigators at Brown without compromising individual access common to stand-alone workstations. The requested computer cluster has system software that automatically balances CPU and GPU usage, thereby ensuring maximum access to the computational resource for all users. Intensive 3D graphics are off-loaded either to GPUs or to client workstations, thereby further reducing the central computational load. Commercial or open-source software with an open operating environment will be used for analysis using standard and novel statistical and machine learning approaches to assess significance of large data sets. This proposal details the architecture and benefits of a contemporary computational resource for the major and minor users, and more generally the Brown brain science community. The resource was designed to fill immediate and near-term computational and storage needs of a core group of Brown brain scientists. The system can be readily expansion as needs, either computational, storage, or new users, arise. Expansion of the existing core investigators group can occur easily since the computational power or storage capacity of the system can be readily enhanced at relatively low cost. The flexible nature of the system will serve a variety of research needs of the Brown brain science community. The computational resource is expected to bring together researchers at Brown working on the common problem of neural processing.             n/a",Brain Science Computer Cluster,8447697,S10OD016366,"['Architecture', 'Brain', 'Client', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'base', 'computer cluster', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'novel', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'software systems']",OD,BROWN UNIVERSITY,S10,2013,599598,-0.02055046026525305
"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.        The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data. With this grant we will improve these tools, make them more robust, and extend them to new sequencing technologies. This is essential to realize the potential of DNA sequencing to understand human history, diversity, and to discover  new loci associated with human disease, leading to new biologic hypotheses and new drug targets.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.        The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.

"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,8508596,K99LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Simulate', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'memory process', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,K99,2013,87300,-0.023255580145274422
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.          RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases. Its contents have contributed both directly and indirectly to large numbers of basic and translational research studies, and it supports a broad, diverse and engaged user community.

"A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a pre-commercial prototype system capable of continuously monitoring involuntary movement disorders from a wide spectrum of neurological conditions. The impact of this innovation will enhance the availability of advanced brain and behavior research tools [PA- 11-134] by providing a continuous means of tracking the presence and severity of movement disorders during normal daily activities. This project will transform our unique movement disorder recognition algorithms into custom software that analyzes movement disorders for specific neurological conditions. The information obtained from body worn sensors will provide an accurate and objective means for assessing the complex and changeable nature of movement disorders. This goal cannot by realized using the current method of self-report questionnaires.  The research strategy for Phase I will establish the merit and feasibility of this effort by developing an Application Generation (AG) software platform using a framework of configurable signal processing modules to generate custom applications for movement disorder analysis (Aim 1). This approach reduces the effort and enhances the flexibility of designing and testing software solutions for these applications. The AG Platform will be developed using C++ software to implement signal processing and machine-learning software modules that operate within a knowledge-based framework that we have previously developed. In Aim 2 we will utilize the AG platform to generate movement disorder analysis software to evaluate a challenging test-case application: freezing-of-gait in Parkinson's disease (PD). The goal is to attain performance metrics for freezing that are comparable to those we have achieved for tremor and dyskinesia in previous efforts.  Phase II will refine the capabilities of the AG platform developed in Phase I. We will augment it with the means to automatically design and train the machine learning algorithms, improve the user-interface, and provide options for viewing and summarizing the results. The improved AG platform will be used to develop customized disorder-analysis software that encompasses the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD (e.g. dystonia, bradykinesia, Parkinsonian gait, tremor, dyskinesia), as well as for other neurological condition, such as Essential Tremor (ET). Firmware will be developed for each custom application to efficiently integrate the analytic software with our existing Trigno wireless sensor data acquisition hardware, which needs to be streamlined for this application. This combined system will be evaluated under research use-case scenarios in Neurology. Phase II will deliver an ambulatory Movement Disorder Monitoring system that not only succeeds in providing state-of-the-art monitoring solutions for PD and Essential Tremor, but has proven technology to develop monitoring solutions for a wide variety of neurological conditions. Future development will transfer this technology to a clinical version of this system.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project is intended to improve the accuracy and reduce the burden of researchers and clinicians when assessing motor outcomes for patients with involuntary movement disorders. The proposed technology will provide a means for evaluating new treatment options, and expedite the delivery of care. The attainment of these goals should increase the effectiveness of research, the time required for these research advancements to reach the consumer, and help control the rising costs of clinical care among the estimated 45 million Americans who have neurological disorders resulting in involuntary movements. The resulting improvements in motor function will ultimately lead to greater independence and productivity for this growing segment of the population.            ",A Software Platform for Sensor-based Movement Disorder Recognition,8521782,R43NS083098,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bradykinesia', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Dystonia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Essential Tremor', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Sector', 'Health Professional', 'Home environment', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Video Recording', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'Writing', 'advanced system', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'care delivery', 'clinical care', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disorder control', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'motor disorder', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel therapeutics', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tool']",NINDS,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2013,424766,-0.01588640101243198
"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex. We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning. To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support: First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management. Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices. Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements. These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology. Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from  microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our user-friendly, open-source cell image  analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org).",Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software,8479372,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Language', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Process Measure', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cluster computing', 'file format', 'fluorescence microscope', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'movie', 'open source', 'outreach', 'processing speed', 'repository', 'research study', 'resource guides', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2013,474880,-0.01260977076305516
"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that advances machine learning algorithms for automatic segmentation and couples these techniques to a scalable tool suite for multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate results.",SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID,8461069,R01NS075314,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Couples', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'biological systems', 'cellular imaging', 'complex biological systems', 'data mining', 'digital imaging', 'electron optics', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'tomography', 'tool', 'web interface']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,425454,-0.00662054395186956
"3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Fris¿n scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Fris¿n scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling, as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters, especially those near Bruch's membrane opening, will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to reduce the burdens of disability and is particularly relevant to the part of NEI's mission regarding understanding blinding eye diseases and preserving sight.                ",3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema,8477880,R01EY023279,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Papilledema', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Swelling', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability burden', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'public health relevance']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2013,339750,-0.011792291429498405
"Scalable Biomedical Pattern Recognition Via Deep Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patterns extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and other biomedical datasets can provide valuable feedback to a learning healthcare system, but our ability to find them is limited by certain manual steps. The dominant approach to finding the patterns uses supervised learning, where a computational algorithm searches for patterns among input variables (or features) that model an outcome variable (or label). This usually requires an expert to specify the learning task, construct input features, and prepare the outcome labels. This workflow has served us well for decades, but the dependence on human effort prevents it from scaling and it misses the most informative patterns, which are almost by definition the ones that nobody anticipates. It is poorly suited to the emerging era of population-scale data, in which we can conceive of massive new undertakings such as surveiling for all emerging diseases, detecting all unanticipated medication effects, or inferring the complete clinical phenotype of all genetic variants.      The approach of unsupervised feature learning overcomes these limitations by identifying meaningful patterns in massive, unlabeled datasets with little or no human involvement. While there is a large literature on feature creation, a new surge of interest in unsupervised methods is being driven by the recent development of deep learning, in which a compact hierarchy of expressive features is learned from large unlabeled datasets. In the domains of image and speech recognition, deep learning has produced features that meet or exceed (by as much as 70%) the previous state of the art on difficult standardized tasks.      Unfortunately, the noisy, sparse, and irregular data typically found in an EMR is a poor substrate for deep learning. Our approach uses Gaussian process regression to convert such an irregular sequence of observations into a longitudinal probability density that is suitable for use with a deep architecture. With this approach, we can learn continuous unsupervised features that capture the longitudinal structure of sparse and irregular observations. In our preliminary results unsupervised features were as powerful (0.96 AUC) in an unanticipated classification task as gold-standard features engineered by an expert with full knowledge of the domain, the classification task, and the class labels.      In this project we will learn unsupervised features for records of all individuals in our deidentifed EMR image, for each of 100 laboratory tests and 200 medications of relevance to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We will evaluate the features using three pattern recognition tasks that were unknown to the feature-learning algorithm: 1) an easy supervised classification task of distinguishing diabetics vs. nondiabetics, 2) a much more difficult task of distinguishing type 1 vs. type 2 diabetics, and 3) a genetic association task that considers the features as micro-phenotypes and measures their association with 29 different single nucleotide polymorphisms with known associations to type 1 or type 2 diabetes.             Every piece of data generated in the course of medical care can provide crucial feedback to a learning healthcare system, but only if relevant patterns can be found among them. The current practice of using human experts to guide the pattern search has served us well for decades, but it is poorly suited to the emerging era of population- scale data, in which we may conceive of massive new undertakings such as detecting all emerging diseases or all unanticipated medication effects. This project will develop methods to mathematically identify such patterns at a large scale, with no need for human judgment to specify what patterns to look for or where to look for them.",Scalable Biomedical Pattern Recognition Via Deep Learning,8566062,R21LM011664,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metformin', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'PTGS2 gene', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Uncertainty', 'Uric Acid', 'Work', 'cell growth', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'density', 'diabetic', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neoplastic cell', 'non-diabetic', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'speech recognition', 'success', 'type I and type II diabetes']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,175500,-0.011336163720505303
"BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ideally, as neuroscientists collect terabytes of image stacks, the data are automatically processed for open access and analysis. Yet, while several labs around the world are collecting data at unprecedented rates- up to terabytes per day-the computational technologies that facilitate streaming data-intensive computing remain absent. Also deploying data-intensive compute clusters is beyond the means and abilities of most experimental labs. This project will extend, develop, and deploy such technologies. To demonstrate these tools, we will utilize them in support of the ongoing mouse brain architecture (MBA) project, which already has amassed over 0.5 petabytes (PBs) of image data. The main computational challenges posed by these datasets are ones of scale. The tasks that follow remain relatively stereotyped across acquisition modalities. Until now, labs collecting data on this scale have been almost entirely isolated, left to ""reinvent the wheel"" for each of these problems. Moreover, the extant solutions are insufficient for a number of reasons: they often include numerous excel spreadsheets that rely on manual data entry, they lack scalable scientific database backends, and they run on ad hoc clusters not specifically designed for the computational tasks at hand. We aim to augment the current state of the art by implementing the following technological advancements into the MBA project pipeline: (1) Data Management will consist of a unified system that automatically captures metadata, launches processing pipelines, and provides quality control feedback in minutes instead of hours. (2) Data Processing tasks will run algorithms ""out-of-core"", appropriate for their computational requirements, including registration, alignment, and semantic segmentation of cell bodies and processes. (3) Data Storage will automatically build databases for storing multimodal image data and extracted annotations learned from the machine vision algorithms. These databases will be spatially co-registered and stored on an optimized heterogeneous compute cluster. (4) Data Access will be automatically available to everyone-including all the image data and data derived products-via Web-services, including 3D viewing, downloading, and further processing. (5) Data Analytics will extend random graph models suitable for multiscale circuit graphs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Nervous system disorders are responsible for approximately 30% of the total burden of illness in the United States. Whole brain neuroanatomy-available from massive neuroscientific image stacks-is widely believed to be a key missing link in our ability to prevent and treat such illnesses. Thus, this project aims to close this gap via the development and application of BIGDATA tools for management, storage, access, and analytics.              n/a",BIGDATA: Small DCM: ESCA DA Computational infrastructure for massive neurosci,8599834,R01DA036400,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Cell physiology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Feedback', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Instruction', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Mus', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Running', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Stereotyping', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'United States', 'Vision', 'burden of illness', 'cluster computing', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized data processing', 'data management', 'design', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal cell body', 'prevent', 'tool', 'web services']",NIDA,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2013,249999,-0.02244684896634441
"In vivo Characterization of Stents using Intravascular OCT Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 100s of thousands of patients in the US are treated with intravascular stents. Although the technology has advanced and drug eluting metal stents hinder restenosis, there remains significant room for improvement. Stent parameters include drug choice, bioresorbable versus metal, mechanical design, coatings to stimulate cell coverage, etc. To optimize designs, sensitive, in vivo assessments are needed for preclinical and clinical studies. Intravascular OCT (iOCT) alone provides the resolution and contrast s necessary for in vivo interrogation of vascular healing; stent deployment issues such as malposition; and assessment of stent strut tissue coverage. The Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory at CWRU analyzes iOCT images as a service to numerous clinical and preclinical trials from around the world. An analyst takes many hours to analyze manually a single stent, greatly limiting the size and number of studies. Despite training and quality assurance measures, inter-analyst variability limits the ability to determine changes between stent types. We will develop highly automated software to greatly speed analysis, improve reproducibility, increase accuracy, etc. Careful evaluations/validations will be performed using our database of >1500 manually analyzed stents, and new phantom and pig studies. With the successful completion of this research and development, we will deliver well-validated, highly automated software, which will enable routine use of iOCT for sensitive evaluation of emerging stent technologies, thereby providing greatly improved treatments of cardiovascular disease. In addition, fast, robust software will contribute to clinical usage of iOCT for assessment of stent deployment and healing of a stented vessel.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop methods for improved in vivo assessment of intravascular stents, the treatment of choice for 100s of thousands of patients, suffering from ischemic heart disease, in the US every year.

"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation.             n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,8644396,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'feeding', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'simulation', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,322109,-0.024812682085004267
"The q-bio Summer School     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems. The complexity and importance of these systems, which govern cellular activities and fates, provides motivation for developing a scientific and engineering workforce equipped to deal with the complexity.            ",The q-bio Summer School,8475276,R25GM105608,"['Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Career Choice', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Minority-Serving Institution', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Participant', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Qualifying', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biochemical model', 'biological research', 'career', 'career development', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'demographics', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'interest', 'lecture notes', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'model design', 'multidisciplinary', 'peer', 'physical science', 'posters', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NIGMS,"NEW MEXICO CONSORTIUM, INC.",R25,2013,174626,-0.03981064480014354

"Coupled level set framework for retinal segmentation and atlasing in SD-OCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Some eye diseases exhibit abnormalities or atrophy of the retina, which can impair vision and cause blindness. Certain other diseases traditionally thought to be exclusively associated with the brain are now known to be associated with changes or differences in the retina, which can also impair vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging device that is enabling modern in-vivo high-resolution studies of the retina, is rapidly becoming a key imaging technology both in ophthalmology, where clinical diagnoses and disease monitoring are experiencing a dramatic technical revolution, and also in neurology, where noninvasive retinal markers of brain disease are beginning to emerge. A key limitation in the current technology is the lack of detailed, accurate, and fully-automated analysis of the retinal layers that are observed throughout the retina in a typical three-dimensional spectral domain (SD)-OCT exam. Although tools are beginning to appear in association with commercial devices, they are currently lacking in sophistication and are not validated or standardized across manufacturers. This deficiency is problematic for both clinical and scientific application of SD-OCT since the measurements are not of known precision and are therefore not easily compared both in the same subject longitudinally and in population cross sections. The proposed research takes advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms that are emerging in both computer vision and medical imaging and will apply, adapt, and extend them to the specific application of layer segmentation in three-dimensional retinal SD-OCT. Advanced tools for population averaging in a normalized space will also be developed specifically for retinal SD-OCT data. The methods will be validated against manual segmentation and normalization on both normal subjects and patients experiencing retinal degeneration largely associated with thinning of selective layers of the retina. Scans of patients with diseases causing significant retinopathy such as cysts, detachment, or scarring will be evaluated, but further development beyond the present research is expected to be needed to properly segment and quantify such cases. The developed software will be developed within the open-source Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) framework and released as open source software.        The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina. Segmentation and quantification of the characteristics of nerve layers within the retina is expected to be of great use on both ophthalmology and neurology, where the retina can be a sensitive indicator of both vision and neurological problems or diseases. Open source software written in a highly portable language will be made available to the research community at the conclusion of the research grant.

"Advanced training platform and methodologies for emergency responders and skilled     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a need to be able to deliver just-in-time training and reference materials for first responders and skilled support personnel. Mobile computing platforms are becoming ubiquitous and provide an ideal means to reach users at any time in any location. The process of translating existing reference materials into mobile-friendly formats is currently manual and very labor intensive. Nicolalde R&D LLC is well under way to commercialize its mTraining mobile technology and service prototyped during a phase I SBIR from NIEHS. The mTraining technology is an objective and checklist-based method for delivering just-in-time training and reference materials, making it an effective Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS) for providing workers easy access to information after training, and on site prior to or during an assignment. It provides short, incident specific awareness and safety training that can be delivered prior to responding to an emergency situation. The proposed development under this phase II SBIR includes: a) a back-end document processing engine that is able to automatically parse, analyze, mark-up, and organize documents so that their content is easily cross-referenced, linked and re-organized for effective delivery on a mobile training platform or other electronic medium. This will be connected to a server and database architecture to facilitate its operation and support storing and accessing content; b) the front-end interface for the mobile training platform (mTraining) was prototyped in Phase I of this project for delivering training content to emergency responders, skilled support personnel, and volunteers before or during an incident. The improved back-end architecture will support intelligent search capabilities for a large repository of training documents with different structures. This capability relies on the document processing engine's ability to semi-automatically extract relevant data and automatically translate this data into a structured format. This data can then be used for display in the mobile application, stored into databases, and automatically populated into ontologies. Throughout this project the participatory-based design paradigm has been used for facilitating the integration of user requirements and the fast prototyping and testing of design alternatives. This approach will continue to be utilized in Phase 2 of the project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research and development will advance the field of environmental health and safety training by bringing to it new and innovative advanced training technologies that are based on the mobile and just-in-time paradigm. Furthermore, the research and development proposed herein will advance the mobile information technology field by developing robust and scalable tools for processing and linking information residing in different source documents that are semantically related.            ",Advanced training platform and methodologies for emergency responders and skilled,8518023,R44ES020135,"['Access to Information', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Case Study', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Materials', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Situation', 'Environmental Health', 'Focus Groups', 'Human Resources', 'Information Technology', 'Link', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Retrieval', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translating', 'Update', 'base', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'operation', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'research and development', 'response', 'tool', 'usability', 'volunteer']",NIEHS,"NICOLALDE R AND D, LLC",R44,2013,142612,-0.01341254530330444
"Informatic tools for predicting an ordinal response for high-dimensional data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. Examples include scoring methods for liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, including the Knodell hepatic activity index, the Ishak score, and the METAVIR score. In addition, tumor-node-metasis stage for cancer patients is an ordinal scaled measure. Moreover, the more recently advocated method for evaluating response to treatment in target tumor lesions is the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors method, with ordinal outcomes defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Traditional ordinal response modeling methods assume independence among the predictor variables and require that the number of samples (n) exceed the number of covariates (p). These are both violated in the context of high-throughput genomic studies. Recently, penalized models have been successfully applied to high-throughput genomic datasets in fitting linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models with excellent performance. However, extension of penalized models to the ordinal response setting has not been fully described nor has software been made generally available. Herein we propose to apply the L1 penalization method to ordinal response models to enable modeling of common ordinal response data when a high-dimensional genomic data comprise the predictor space. This study will expand the scope of our current research by providing additional model-based ordinal classification methodologies applicable for high-dimensional datasets to accompany the heuristic based classification tree and random forest ordinal methodologies we have previously described. The specific aims of this application are to: (1) Develop R functions for implementing the stereotype logit model as well as an L1 penalized stereotype logit model for modeling an ordinal response. (2) Empirically examine the performance of the L1 penalized stereotype logit model and competitor ordinal response models by performing a simulation study and applying the models to publicly available microarray datasets. (3) Develop an R package for fitting a random-effects ordinal regression model for clustered ordinal response data. (4) Extend the random-effects ordinal regression model to include an L1 penalty term to accomodate high-dimensional covariate spaces and empirically examine the performance of the L1random-effects ordinal regression model through application to microarray data. Studies involving protocol biopsies where both histopathological assessment and microarray studies are performed at the same time point are increasingly being performed, so that the methodology and software developed in this application will provide unique informatic methods for analyzing such data. Moreover, the ordinal response extensions proposed in this application, though initially conceived of by considering microarray applications, will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect human preference data and other responses on an ordinal scale.               Most histopathological variables are reported on an ordinal scale.

"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements.         Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model forth understanding of chromosome maintenance, the cell cycle and cellular biology. S. cerevisiae is used for the development of new genomic and proteomic technologies.

"Informatics to enable routine personalized cancer therapy  Program Director/Principal Investigator (Bernstam, Elmer Victor) Abstract Genomic analysis of individual patients is now affordable and therapies targeted to specific molecular aberrations are being tested in clinical trials. However, even highly-specialized physicians at leading academic centers are not equipped to apply genomic information available in publically available sources to clinical- decision-making concerning individual patients. Our central hypothesis is that we can develop informatics tools to support personalized cancer treatment as ""standard of care"" rather than ""one off"" exceptions. We will: 1) implement a bioinformatics pipeline for processing molecular data into actionable profiles, 2) create and maintain a database of therapeutic implications of common genomic aberrations using automated processing of publically-available sources and 3) develop tools to summarize and present patient-specific advice to clinicians. These tools will be based on existing technologies and publicly available data sources. Once tested, we will make these tools available via appropriate open source license.

"ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS No abstract available PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All skilled clinical practitioners and interpreters of ultrasound studies realize that much information exists in recorded US images that is processed immediately by the visual cortex and is useful for qualitatively defining pathology, yet defies ready quantification by any robust algorithm. Traditional energy-based representations display grayscale intensities and speckle patterns that have been mapped parametrically into various tissue classification schemes that have yet to demonstrate organ or tissue specificity, although progress has been reported in distinguishing pathologies over the last 30 years. However, the fact that US signal processing and representation of backscatter data in terms of energy functions has not changed over the last 50 years suggests that alternative signal processing schemes may be indicated to represent the richness of the information contained within the backscattered data. To meet this challenge, we have been involved over the past 10 years in processing backscattered RF to create ""information"" images and in designing ""information sensitive"" approaches to classifying the data sets based on statistical analysis of these images These novel and user independent metrics utilize the entropy of windowed segments of radiofrequency (RF) backscatter signal from tis- sue, which represents a radical departure from grayscale or speckle metrics. In this approach the entropy of the backscattered segment is used to produce a pixel value in the tissue image. This processing strategy has proven to be sensitive to weak, sub-resolution sized changes in tissue.            ",ENTROPY-BASED TISSUE DISCRIMINATORS,8636638,R21EB018095,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Base Composition', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Cardiac', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Expeditions', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Fractals', 'Frequencies', 'Heart', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Microscopic', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Radio', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data reduction', 'design', 'detector', 'heart motion', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'n-dimensional', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'sound', 'tissue processing', 'vector']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,228000,-0.022511835696922694

"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the next-generation sequencing analysis tools, and thereby allowing biomedical researchers to take full advantage of next-generation sequencing to study biology and disease.              DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms.

"ISMB 2012 Conference Support for Students & Young Scientists     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 2012 Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in will be held in Long Beach, California, with 1,500-1,700 attendees, including 33-38% students/post doctoral researchers. ISMB brings together graduate students, post doctoral researchers, faculty, research staff and senior scientists of many different nationalities, all of whom are studying or working in computer science, molecular biology, mathematics or statistics. The conference brings biologists and computational scientists together to focus on research centered on actual biological problems rather than simply theoretical calculations. The combined focus on ""intelligent systems"" and actual biological data makes ISMB a highly relevant meeting, and many years of producing the event has resulted in a professionally organized and respected annual conference. The ISMB conference presents the latest research methods and results developed through the application of computer programming to the study of biological sciences, including advances in sequencing genomes that may lead to a better understanding of how, for instance, cells interact for the treatment of diseases such as cancer. Presentations may describe methods and advances associated with the analysis of existing biological literature, including benchmarking experiments, to create a better public understanding of scientific research reports. Overall, ISMB serves to educate attendees on the latest developments that will further drive the research methods and results of the field of computational biology. Students and scientists are able to return to their labs to appy what they have learned as they advance their own research efforts or begin investigating new areas they were exposed to as a result of attending ISMB. The scientific program for each ISMB meeting includes parallel presentation tracks of original research papers, highlights of recently published papers, special sessions focused on emerging topics, technology demos, late breaking research and poster presentations, an art in science exhibition, tutorial workshops, special interest group meetings and a student symposium organized by and for students. For ISMB 2011, 258 original research papers were submitted and 48 selected for the Proceedings Track, while 88 previously published papers were submitted and 38 selected for the Highlights Track. In all, over 225 talks were presented during the course of the 2011 conference, and similar numbers are anticipated for 2012. In all cases, submissions are rigorously reviewed, typically by three members of each track's committee before approval by the track chair, insuring the highest possible quality of work is presented. The specific areas represented in the conference vary each year depending on the areas that researchers find most interesting and innovative, and therefore submit as papers and proposals. This proposal seeks funding to assist students and junior researchers in attending the conference, thus exposing them to the latest research of their own areas as well as areas that may be new to them.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems, largely driven by genomic sequence efforts due to the usefulness of genomic data in the quest to develop new and improved treatments for and prevention of disease is highly dependent on one's ability to electronically access and manipulate it. The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference series directly addresses these questions by showcasing the latest advances in the field and exposing what's on the horizon of future discoveries, but is distinguished from many other events in computational biology or artificial intelligence by an insistence that the researchers work with real molecular biology data, not theoretical or toy examples. Although the cultures of computer science and biology are so disparate, ISMB bridges this cultural gap by providing a forum among biological conferences that features technical advances as they occur, which otherwise may be shunned until a firm experimental result is published.              Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems, largely driven by genomic sequence efforts due to the usefulness of genomic data in the quest to develop new and improved treatments for and prevention of disease is highly dependent on one's ability to electronically access and manipulate it.

"Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique for searching large libraries of chemical or genetic perturbants, to find new treatments for a disease or to better understand disease pathways. As automated image analysis for cultured cells has improved, microscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to analyze screening samples. However, many diseases and biological pathways can be better studied in whole animals-particularly diseases that involve organ systems and multicellular interactions, such as metabolism and infection. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established and effective model organism, used by thousands of researchers worldwide to study complex biological processes. Samples of C. elegans can be robotically prepared and imaged by high-throughput microscopy, but existing image-analysis methods are insuf- ficient for most assays. In this project, image-analysis algorithms that are capable of scoring high-throughput assays of C. elegans will be developed.  The algorithms will be tested and refined in three high-throughput screens, which will uncover chemical and genetic regulators of fat metabolism and infection: (1) A C. elegans viability assay to identify modulators of infection. The proposed algorithms use a probabilistic shape model of C. elegans in order to identify and mea- sure individual worms even when the animals touch or cross. These methods are the basis for quantifying many other phenotypes, including body morphology and subtle variations in reporter signal levels. (2) A C. elegans lipid assay to identify genes that regulate fat metabolism. The algorithms proposed for illumination correction, level-set-based foreground segmentation, well-edge detection, and artifact removal will result in improved or- business in high-throughput experiments. (3) A fluorescence gene expression assay to identify regulators of the response of the C. elegans host to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The proposed techniques for constructing anatomical maps of C. elegans will make it possible to quantify a variety of changes in fluorescent localization patterns in a biologically relevant way.  In addition to discovering new metabolism- and infection-related drugs and genetic regulators through these specific screens, this work will provide the C. elegans community with (a) a new framework for extracting mor- phological features from C. elegans for quantitative analysis of this organism, and (b) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms enabling the discovery of genetic pathways, chemical probes, and drug can- didates in whole organism high-throughput screens relevant to a variety of diseases.  This work is a close collaboration with C. elegans experts Fred Ausubel and Gary Ruvkun at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with Polina Golland and Tammy Riklin-Raviv, experts in model-based segmentation and statistical image analysis at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and with Anne Carpenter, developer of open-source image analysis software at the Broad Institute.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms.

"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data.

"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC) proposal aims to provide a flexible analysis resource for the ENCODE project. The ENCODE project is a large multi center project which aims to define all the functional elements in the human genome. This will be achieved using many different experimental techniques coupled with numerous computational techniques. A critical part in delivering this set of functional elements is the integration of data from multiple sources. The ED AC proposal aims to provide this integration. As proscribed by the RFA for this proposal, the precise prioritization for the EDAC's work will be set by an external group, the Analysis Working Group (AWG). Based on previous experience, these analysis methods will require a variety of techniques. We expect to have to apply sophisticated statistical models to the integration of the data, in particular mitigating the problems of the extensive heterogeneity and correlation of variables on the human genome. We have statistical experts who can use the large size of the human genome, coupled with a limited number of sensible assumptions to produce statistical techniques which are robust to this considerable heterogeneity. We also expect to apply machine learning techniques to build integration methods combining datasets. These included Bayesian based inference methods and the robust computer science technique of Support Vector Machines. Each of these methods have performed well in the ENCODE pilot project and we expect them to be even more useful in the full ENCODE project.

"Developing an online educational curriculum to enhance parent-supervised driving     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death and injury for teens, accounting annually for over 3000 deaths, 100 times as many injuries, and over 14 billion dollars in associated costs. The CDC has identified traffic crashes and associated injuries as a top public health priority. Inexperience is the leading cause of crashes among novice teen drivers, but accumulating the necessary experiences to become a safe driver can take many years. Fortunately, evidence from driving and other domains suggests that it is possible to increase experiential knowledge through scenario-based training. Current methods for providing teens with practice focus on parent-supervised driving. However, parents are ill-prepared to handle this role, with many focusing only on the mechanics of driving, laws and general safety advice. Few parents discuss decision-making aspects of driving and may even pass on inaccurate information. Many parents limit the range of driving situations teens are exposed to mistakenly believing that this increases safety rather than dangerously limiting teens' ability to accumulate important driving experience. Our long-term objective is to design and validate an innovative tool that aims to accelerate the acquisition of critical safety knowledge for teen drivers. We propose to extend our team's past work by developing scenarios appropriate for parents to use to mentor their inexperienced teen drivers. The scenarios will be part of an online educational curriculum designed to help parents provide teens with guided practice as they learn how to drive. The online tool will combine scenario- based training with innovative applications of machine learning technology to evaluate scenario responses and provide tailored feedback containing practical, developmentally appropriate strategies for improving safety as well as recommendations for parent-supervised on-the-road practice. Phase I will address these specific aims: 1) Conduct foundational research to identify realistic scenarios commonly encountered by novice teen drivers through semi-structured interviews with teen drivers aged 15-18. 2) Collect representative responses to scenarios from teens with different levels of driving experience and adults to identify the progression of knowledge and identify developmentally appropriate strategies to use as feedback. 3) Create machine learning algorithms to provide tailored feedback and recommend on-the-road driving experiences based on responses to the scenarios. 4) Develop prototype online system. Phase II will focus on additional specific aims: 5) Develop the Phase I proof of concept into a complete online curriculum with refined algorithms. 6) Evaluate the online curriculum for usability, acceptance via focus groups, and effectiveness via a driving simulator experiment and limited field trial with novice teen drivers. The proposed product represents a significant shift in trainig approaches for teen drivers and through Phase III dissemination it will fill a critical need for evidence- based parent-taught driver's education.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death and injury for teens, accounting annually for over 3000 deaths, 100 times as many injuries, and over 14 billion dollars in associated costs; despite this, many teens' primary source of driver's education is their parents. In Phase I we propose to extend our past work for teaching experiential knowledge and develop a prototype online educational curriculum that allows parents to provide teens with guided practice by utilizing innovative machine learning technologies, while Phase II will allow us to complete the prototype and evaluate its effectiveness.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.        The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated knowledgebase available online as an open access resource that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by geneticists, genomics researchers, clinical researchers and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomics studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and abnormal pathways.  Our curational system draws heavily on the expertise of independent investigators within the community who author precise machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways under the guidance of a staff of dedicated curators. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated pathways described by Reactome currently cover roughly one quarter of the translated portion of the genome. We also offer a network of ""functional interactions"" (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, that covers an additional quarter of the translated genome, for a combined coverage of roughly 50% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we seek to (1) increase the number of curated proteins and other functional entities to at least 10,500; (2) to supplement normal pathways with variant reactions for 1200 genes representing disease states; (3) increase the size of the Reactome Fl network to 15,000 molecules; and (4) enhance the web site and other resources to meet the needs of a growing and diverse user community.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Reactome represents one of a very small number of fully open access curated pathway databases.

"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex.  We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support:  First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management.  Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices.  Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements.  These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:           Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from  microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our user-friendly, open-source cell image  analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org).",Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software,8274831,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Language', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Process Measure', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cluster computing', 'file format', 'fluorescence microscope', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'movie', 'open source', 'outreach', 'processing speed', 'repository', 'research study', 'resource guides', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2012,503268,-0.013387448982049322
"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses.

"Coupled level set framework for retinal segmentation and atlasing in SD-OCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Some eye diseases exhibit abnormalities or atrophy of the retina, which can impair vision and cause blindness. Certain other diseases traditionally thought to be exclusively associated with the brain are now known to be associated with changes or differences in the retina, which can also impair vision. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an imaging device that is enabling modern in-vivo high-resolution studies of the retina, is rapidly becoming a key imaging technology both in ophthalmology, where clinical diagnoses and disease monitoring are experiencing a dramatic technical revolution, and also in neurology, where noninvasive retinal markers of brain disease are beginning to emerge. A key limitation in the current technology is the lack of detailed, accurate, and fully-automated analysis of the retinal layers that are observed throughout the retina in a typical three-dimensional spectral domain (SD)-OCT exam. Although tools are beginning to appear in association with commercial devices, they are currently lacking in sophistication and are not validated or standardized across manufacturers. This deficiency is problematic for both clinical and scientific application of SD-OCT since the measurements are not of known precision and are therefore not easily compared both in the same subject longitudinally and in population cross sections. The proposed research takes advantage of state-of-the-art algorithms that are emerging in both computer vision and medical imaging and will apply, adapt, and extend them to the specific application of layer segmentation in three-dimensional retinal SD-OCT. Advanced tools for population averaging in a normalized space will also be developed specifically for retinal SD-OCT data. The methods will be validated against manual segmentation and normalization on both normal subjects and patients experiencing retinal degeneration largely associated with thinning of selective layers of the retina. Scans of patients with diseases causing significant retinopathy such as cysts, detachment, or scarring will be evaluated, but further development beyond the present research is expected to be needed to properly segment and quantify such cases. The developed software will be developed within the open-source Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST) framework and released as open source software.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop software for the image analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the retina. Segmentation and quantification of the characteristics of nerve layers within the retina is expected to be of great use on both ophthalmology and neurology, where the retina can be a sensitive indicator of both vision and neurological problems or diseases.

"Informatic tools for predicting an ordinal response for high-dimensional data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. Examples include scoring methods for liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, including the Knodell hepatic activity index, the Ishak score, and the METAVIR score. In addition, tumor-node-metasis stage for cancer patients is an ordinal scaled measure. Moreover, the more recently advocated method for evaluating response to treatment in target tumor lesions is the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors method, with ordinal outcomes defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Traditional ordinal response modeling methods assume independence among the predictor variables and require that the number of samples (n) exceed the number of covariates (p). These are both violated in the context of high-throughput genomic studies. Recently, penalized models have been successfully applied to high-throughput genomic datasets in fitting linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models with excellent performance. However, extension of penalized models to the ordinal response setting has not been fully described nor has software been made generally available. Herein we propose to apply the L1 penalization method to ordinal response models to enable modeling of common ordinal response data when a high-dimensional genomic data comprise the predictor space. This study will expand the scope of our current research by providing additional model-based ordinal classification methodologies applicable for high-dimensional datasets to accompany the heuristic based classification tree and random forest ordinal methodologies we have previously described. The specific aims of this application are to: (1) Develop R functions for implementing the stereotype logit model as well as an L1 penalized stereotype logit model for modeling an ordinal response. (2) Empirically examine the performance of the L1 penalized stereotype logit model and competitor ordinal response models by performing a simulation study and applying the models to publicly available microarray datasets. (3) Develop an R package for fitting a random-effects ordinal regression model for clustered ordinal response data. (4) Extend the random-effects ordinal regression model to include an L1 penalty term to accomodate high-dimensional covariate spaces and empirically examine the performance of the L1random-effects ordinal regression model through application to microarray data. Studies involving protocol biopsies where both histopathological assessment and microarray studies are performed at the same time point are increasingly being performed, so that the methodology and software developed in this application will provide unique informatic methods for analyzing such data. Moreover, the ordinal response extensions proposed in this application, though initially conceived of by considering microarray applications, will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect human preference data and other responses on an ordinal scale.               Most histopathological variables are reported on an ordinal scale.

"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies. We plan to extend the Protigi ontology editor-the most widely used ontology editor today, with almost 100,000 registered users-to support collaborative development of ontologies and to evaluate the new tools by deploying them at the World Health Organization for the development of ICD-11 and in other settings.             n/a",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,8242742,R01GM086587,"['Adopted', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Published Comment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Systems Development', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'conflict resolution', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forging', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,392767,-0.01700930584690811
"Genomic Database for the Yeast Saccharomyces    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) is to continue the development and implementation of a comprehensive resource containing curated information about the genome and its elements of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. SGD will continue to annotate the genome, assimilate new data, include genomic information from other fungal species, and incorporate formalized and controlled vocabularies to represent biological concepts. We will continue to maintain and broaden relationships with the greater scientific community and make technical improvements through the development of tools and the use of third party tools that will allow us to better serve our users. The database and its associated resources will always remain publicly available without restriction from www.yeastgenome.org.  SGD will continue to provide the S. cerevisiae genome and its gene products culled from the published literature. New user interfaces and analysis resources will be developed for existing information as well as for new types of data, such as results from large scale genomic/proteomic analysis. These improvements will be developed using publicly available tools such as those available from the GMOD project. Query tools will be more enhanced to instantly direct users to the appropriate pages.  SGD has evolved into a substantial service organization, and will maintain its service to the scientific community, reaching out to all yeast researchers as well as scientists outside the fungal community to serve those who have a need for information about budding yeast genes, their products, and their functions. SGD will continue existing services while working to simplify the use and maintenance of our hardware and software environment through the application of new technologies. We will continue to collaborate with the yeast biology community to keep the database accurate and current, and to maintain consensus and order in the naming of genes and other generic elements.         Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model forth understanding of chromosome maintenance, the cell cycle and cellular biology. S. cerevisiae is used for the development of new genomic and proteomic technologies.

"HealthMap: Knowledge Management for Emerging Infectious Disease Intelligence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Even as many developed countries strengthen their traditional clinically-based surveillance capacity, a basic level of health information infrastructure is still lacking in many parts of the developing world, including areas that are most vulnerable to emerging health threats. To help fill this gap, electronic news outlets, disease reporting networks, discussion sites, and blogs are proving to be invaluable data sources for a new generation of public health surveillance systems that operate across international borders- almost all major outbreaks investigated by WHO, including SARS, are first identified by these informal online sources. These data sources provide local and timely information about disease outbreaks and related events around the world, including areas relatively invisible to day-to-day global public health efforts due to lack of infrastructure or political suppression of information. However, since this information is dispersed and largely unstructured, there is lack of organization and integration between sources, precluding a global view of all ongoing disease threats. In order to construct such an integrated view of current emerging infections, we deployed an early prototype called Health Map, a freely available multi-stream real-time knowledge management system that aggregates and maps health alerts across numerous key data sources, including WHO alerts, newswires, mailing lists. Leveraging our previous National Library of Medicine funded work in real-time health monitoring; we propose extensive development of this new digital resource to address technological and methodological barriers to achieving a synthesized, comprehensive, and customized view of global health. The principal objective of Health Map development is to provide access to the greatest amount of possibly useful information across the widest variety of geographical areas and disease agents, without overwhelming the user with an excess of information, or obscuring important and urgent elements. We will specifically address the challenge of providing structure to unstructured data while still enabling the astute user to notice the subtle pattern that could be an early indication of a significant outbreak. Development of Health Map will proceed along the four key components of surveillance: (1) data acquisition (evaluation and integration of multiple electronic sources) (2) information characterization (disease and location categorization and severity rating of unstructured data), (3) signal interpretation (multi-stream signal detection, spatiotemporal modeling and risk assessment) and (4) knowledge dissemination (tiered dissemination of global infectious disease alerts and flexible data visualization tools). In each area, we will make critical enhancements to the existing prototype. We plan rigorous evaluation to ensure that Health Map successfully leverages electronic sources for surveillance, communication, and intervention. We will also conduct comprehensive user testing, usability studies, user behavior analysis as part of our effort. Our goal is to make Health Map a vital knowledge resource tailored for both the general public and public health decision-makers.        Although an enormous amount of information about current infectious disease outbreaks is found in Web- accessible information sources, this information is dispersed and not well-organized, making it almost impossible for public health officials and concerned citizens to know about all ongoing emerging disease threats. Through rigorous development of our online HealthMap system, we plan to provide a synthesized, timely and comprehensive view of current global infectious disease outbreaks by acquiring, integrating and disseminating a wide variety of Internet-based information sources.

"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data.

"Image analysis for high-throughput C. elegans infection and metabolism assays    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput screening (HTS) is a technique for searching large libraries of chemical or genetic perturbants, to find new treatments for a disease or to better understand disease pathways. As automated image analysis for cultured cells has improved, microscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful and informative ways to analyze screening samples. However, many diseases and biological pathways can be better studied in whole animals-particularly diseases that involve organ systems and multicellular interactions, such as metabolism and infection. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established and effective model organism, used by thousands of researchers worldwide to study complex biological processes. Samples of C. elegans can be robotically prepared and imaged by high-throughput microscopy, but existing image-analysis methods are insuf- ficient for most assays. In this project, image-analysis algorithms that are capable of scoring high-throughput assays of C. elegans will be developed.  The algorithms will be tested and refined in three high-throughput screens, which will uncover chemical and genetic regulators of fat metabolism and infection: (1) A C. elegans viability assay to identify modulators of infection. The proposed algorithms use a probabilistic shape model of C. elegans in order to identify and mea- sure individual worms even when the animals touch or cross. These methods are the basis for quantifying many other phenotypes, including body morphology and subtle variations in reporter signal levels. (2) A C. elegans lipid assay to identify genes that regulate fat metabolism. The algorithms proposed for illumination correction, level-set-based foreground segmentation, well-edge detection, and artifact removal will result in improved or- business in high-throughput experiments. (3) A fluorescence gene expression assay to identify regulators of the response of the C. elegans host to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The proposed techniques for constructing anatomical maps of C. elegans will make it possible to quantify a variety of changes in fluorescent localization patterns in a biologically relevant way.  In addition to discovering new metabolism- and infection-related drugs and genetic regulators through these specific screens, this work will provide the C. elegans community with (a) a new framework for extracting mor- phological features from C. elegans for quantitative analysis of this organism, and (b) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms enabling the discovery of genetic pathways, chemical probes, and drug can- didates in whole organism high-throughput screens relevant to a variety of diseases.  This work is a close collaboration with C. elegans experts Fred Ausubel and Gary Ruvkun at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with Polina Golland and Tammy Riklin-Raviv, experts in model-based segmentation and statistical image analysis at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and with Anne Carpenter, developer of open-source image analysis software at the Broad Institute.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large-scale screening experiments that test the effects of thousands of chemicals or genetic perturbants by microscopy and image analysis can discover new treatments and help biomedical scientists understand dis- ease mechanisms.

"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC) proposal aims to provide a flexible analysis resource for the ENCODE project. The ENCODE project is a large multi center project which aims to define all the functional elements in the human genome. This will be achieved using many different experimental techniques coupled with numerous computational techniques. A critical part in delivering this set of functional elements is the integration of data from multiple sources. The ED AC proposal aims to provide this integration. As proscribed by the RFA for this proposal, the precise prioritization for the EDAC's work will be set by an external group, the Analysis Working Group (AWG). Based on previous experience, these analysis methods will require a variety of techniques. We expect to have to apply sophisticated statistical models to the integration of the data, in particular mitigating the problems of the extensive heterogeneity and correlation of variables on the human genome. We have statistical experts who can use the large size of the human genome, coupled with a limited number of sensible assumptions to produce statistical techniques which are robust to this considerable heterogeneity. We also expect to apply machine learning techniques to build integration methods combining datasets. These included Bayesian based inference methods and the robust computer science technique of Support Vector Machines. Each of these methods have performed well in the ENCODE pilot project and we expect them to be even more useful in the full ENCODE project. We will also provide quality assurance and summary metrics of genome-wide multiple alignments. This area has a number of complex statistical, algorithmic and engineering issues, which we will solve using state of the art techniques. Overall we aim to provide deep integration of the ENCODE data, under the direction of the AWG and in tight collaboration with the other members of the ENCODE consortium.           n/a",EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center,8107695,U01HG004695,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Indium', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Transcript', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'experience', 'experimental analysis', 'flexibility', 'foot', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'working group']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U01,2011,108418,-0.009112614917858586
"The Statistical and Computational Analysis of Flow Cytometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Flow cytometry is a data-rich technology that plays a critical role in basic research and clinical therapy for a variety of human diseases. Recent technological developments have greatly increased the areas of application and data throughput, and corresponding innovative analysis methods are needed. In order to be able to take advantage of these new capabilities researchers need access to high quality analysis tools that will help to identify subpopulations of cells with particular characteristics.

"The Crystallography of Macromolecules    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal ""The Crystallography of Macromolecules"" addresses the limitations of diffraction data analysis methods in the field of X-ray crystallography. The significance of this work is determined by the importance of the technique, which generates uniquely-detailed information about cellular processes at the atomic level. The structural results obtained with crystallography are used to explain and validate results obtain by other biophysical, biochemical and cell biology techniques, to generate hypotheses for detailed studies of cellular process and to guide drug design studies - all of which are highly relevant to NIH mission. The proposal focuses on method development to address a frequent situation, where the crystal size and order is insufficient to obtain a structure from a single crystal. This is particularly frequent in cases of large eukaryotic complexes and membrane proteins, where the structural information is the most valuable to the NIH mission. The diffraction power of a single crystal is directly related to the microscopic order and size of that specimen. It is also one of the main correlates of structure solution success. The method used to solve the problem of data insufficiency in the case of a single crystal is to use multiple crystals and to average data between them, which allows to retrieve even very low signals. However, different crystals of the same protein, even if they are very similar i.e. have the same crystal lattice symmetry and very similar unit cell dimensions, still are characterized by a somewhat different order. This non-isomorphism is often high enough to make their solution with averaged data impossible. Moreover, the use of multiple data sets complicates decision making as each of the datasets contains different information and it is not clear when and how to combine them. The proposed solution relies on hierarchical analysis. First, the shape of the diffraction spot profiles will be modeled using a novel approach (Aim 1). This will form the ground for the next step, in which deconvolution of overlapping Bragg spot profiles from multiple lattices will be achieved (Aim 2). An additional benefit of algorithms developed in Aim 1 is that they will automatically derive the integration parameters and identify artifacts, making the whole process more robust. This is particularly significant for high-throughput and multiple crystal analysis. In Aim 3, comparison of data from multiple crystals will be performed to identify subsets of data that should be merged to produce optimal results. The critical aspect of this analysis will be the identification and assessment of non- isomorphism between datasets. The experimental decision-making strategy is the subject of Aim 4. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method will be used to evaluate the suitability of available datasets for possible methods of structure solution. In cases of insufficient data it will identify the most significant factor that needs to be improved. Aim 5 is to simplify navigation of data reduction and to integrate the results of previous aims with other improvements in hardware and computing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes. The development of such methods is essential to advance structural studies in thousands of projects, which individually are important for NIH mission.             The goal of the proposal is to develop methods for analysis of X-ray diffraction data with a particular focus on the novel analysis of diffraction spot shape and the streamlining of data analysis in multi-crystal modes.

"Stochastic dynamics for multiscale biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Complex biological systems are increasingly subject to investigation by mathematical modeling in general and stochastic simulation in particular. Advanced mathematical methods will be used to generate next-generation computational methods and algorithms for (1) formulating these models, (2) simulating or sampling their stochastic dynamics, (3) reducing them to simpler approximating models for use in multiscale simulation, and (4) optimizing their unknown or partly known parameters to fit observed behaviors and/or measurements. The proposed methods are based on advances in applied statistical and stochastic mathematics, including advances arising from operator algebra, quantum field theory, stochastic processes, statistical physics, machine learning, and related mathematically grounded fields. A central technique in this work will be the use of the operator algebra formulation of the chemical master equation.       The biological systems to be studied include and are representative of high-value biomedical target systems whose complexity and spatiotemporal scale requires improved mathematical and computational methods, to obtain the scientific understanding underlying future medical intervention. Cancer research is broadly engaged in signal transduction systems and complexes with feedback, for which the yeast Ste5 MARK pathway is a model system. DNA damage sensing (through ATM) and repair control (though p53 and Mdm2) are at least equally important to cancer research owing to the central role that failure of these systems play in many cancers. The dendritic spine synapse system is central to neuroplasticity and therefore human learning and memory. It is critical to understand this neurobiological system well enough to protect it against neurodegenerative diseases and environmental insults.

"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex.  We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support:  First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management.  Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices.  Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements.  These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:           Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from  microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our user-friendly, open-source cell image  analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org).",Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software,8102722,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Process Measure', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cluster computing', 'file format', 'fluorescence microscope', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'movie', 'open source', 'outreach', 'processing speed', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'research study', 'resource guides', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2011,458901,-0.013387448982049322
"SLASH: SCALABLE LARGE ANALYTIC SEGMENTATION HYBRID DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advanced instrumentation and cellular imaging techniques using high-throughput 3D electron microscopy are driving a new revolution in the exploration of complex biological systems by providing near seamless views across multiple scales of resolution. These datasets provide the necessary breadth and depth to analyze multicellular, cellular, and subcelluar structure across large swathes of neural tissue. While these new imaging procedures are generating extremely large datasets of enormous value, the quantities are such that no single user or even laboratory team can possibly analyze the full content of their own imaging activities through traditional means. To address this challenge, we propose to further develop and refine a prototype hybrid system for high-throughput segmentation of large neuropil datasets that: 1) advances automatic algorithms for segmentation of cellular and sub-cellular structures using machine learning techniques; 2) couples these techniques to a scalable and flexible process or tool suite allowing multiple users to simultaneously review, edit and curate the results of these automatic approaches; and, 3) builds a knowledge base of training data guiding and improving automated processing. This system will allow project scientists to select areas of interest, execute automatic segmentation algorithms, and distribute workload, curate data, and deposit final results into the Cell Centered Database (Martone et al. 2008) via accessible web-interfaces. Emerging techniques in cellular and subcellular 3D imaging are generating datasets of enormous value to the study of disease processes and to the pursuit of greater insight into the structure and function of the nervous system. To unlock the potential of these data, new solutions are needed to improve the capability to segment and label the individual molecular, subcellular and cellular components within very large volumetric expanses.

"Rational design of cytokine releasing angiogenic constructs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of organized vascular networks necessitates a tightly regulated interplay between variable cells, growth factors and soluble mediators. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop therapeutic angiogenic strategies based on the rational design of cytokine releasing constructs that promote vascular patterning and vessel stability. The objective of this proposal is to i) develop electrospun, three-dimensional constructs with patterned architecture, ii) demonstrate that the spatial and temporal delivery of two model angiogenic growth factors promotes the formation of an organized capillary network and iii) develop a computational model that can predict the biological effect of a growth factor releasing construct as a function of specified fabrication parameters. We hypothesize that guided therapeutic angiogenesis (i.e. patterned vascular networks) can be obtained by controlling the spatial and temporal presentation of soluble mediators at the site of ischemia. In AIM I, we will synthesize bFGF and G-CSF releasing electrospun constructs and determine their programmed delivery as a function of fabrication parameters. In AIM II, we will demonstrate the effect of spatial and temporal control of cytokine delivery in promoting directed angiogenesis in a three-dimensional in vitro angiogenesis model and we will develop a computational model/software that can predict the biological effect of different scaffold configurations.

"NLP for Augmentative and Alternative Communication in Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal relates to the technology of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).  The research, to be developed over the three-year course of this project, relates to increasing communication speed for adult users of typing-based AAC devices. The proposed method has commonalities both with chatter bots and more sophisticated automated question answering systems. In particular, we propose to develop a program that will mine a very large database of stored interactions for sentences that are similar to the sentence currently being uttered by the interlocutor, and propose a set of plausible responses for the AAC user. The outcome of this research will be a system that improves over the current state of the art in whole utterance approaches in AAC, making use of sophisticated natural language processing techniques.    Through this research and its practical application to helping real people with real communications needs, as well as coursework, seminars, participation in the AAC and disabilities community in Portland, OR, and intensive one-on-one meetings with his mentor Dr. Melanie Fried-Oken, the PI will accrue substantial clinical experience in AAC, and will gain a deep understanding of how technology can be used to help people.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will develop a research program in the field of Augmentative and Alternative Communication.

"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases.

"Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software with Automated Gating    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is used to rapidly gather large quantities of data on cell type and function. The manual process of classifying hundreds of thousands of cells forms a bottleneck in diagnostics, high-throughput screening, clinical trials, and large-scale research experiments. The process currently requires a trained technician to identify populations on a digital graph of the data by manually drawing regions. As the complexity of the data increases, this gating task becomes more lengthy and laborious, and it is increasingly clear that minimizing human processing is essential to increasing both throughput and consistency. In clinical tests and diagnostic environments, automated gating would eliminate a complex set of human instructions and decisions in the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), thereby reducing error and speeding results to the doctor. In many cases, the software will be able to recognize the need for additional tests before the doctor has an opportunity to look at the first report. Currently no software is available to perform complex multi-parameter analyses in an automated and rigorously validated manner. FlowDx will fill an important gap in the evolution of the technology and pave the way for ever larger phenotypic studies and for the translation of this research process to a clinical environment. Specific Aims 1) Fully define the experimental protocol, whereby a researcher can compare two or more classifications of identical data sets to study the differences, biases and effectiveness of human and algorithmic classifiers. 2) Describe and evaluate metrics that compare the performance of classification algorithms. 3) Conduct analytical experiments on our identified use cases, illustrating the potential of this technique to affect clinical analysis. 4) Iteratively implement the tools to automate these experiments, improve the experimental capabilities, and collaborate in new use cases. These aims will be satisfied while maintaining quantitative standards of software quality, establishing measurements in system uptime, throughput and robustness to set the baseline for subsequent iterations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FlowDx, a Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software Project is designed to create a new, more efficient, and more effective way of analyzing cells for the presence of cancer, HIV/ AIDS, and other diseases, using a fully automated software system. Using Magnetic Gating, Probability Clustering, Subtractive Cluster Analysis, Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), Tree Star software will analyze the cell samples from patients at a much faster rate and with fewer false positives and negatives than the manual method now in use. The FlowDx Project 1) Fits the ""translational medicine"" model of the NIH Roadmap 2) Reduces error in the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases 3) Speeds results to physicians. Patients learn the outcome more quickly. Therapeutic intervention is faster. 4) Accommodates large-scale research by allowing greater volumes of complex data to be much more quickly examined, compared, and quantified 5) Reduces the expense of cell analysis by as much as 50% 6) Conforms to 21CFR Part 11 guidance           Narrative FlowDx, a Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software Project is designed to create a new, more efficient, and more effective way of analyzing cells for the presence of cancer, HIV/ AIDS, and other diseases, using a fully automated software system.

"ISMB 2011 Conference Support for Students & Young Scientists    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ISMB 2011 Conference Travel Support for Students and Young Scientists.  The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in 2011 will be held in Vienna, Austria, as a conference of approximately 1,500-1,700 attendees, including 33-38% students/post doctoral researchers. ISMB brings together graduate students, post doctoral researchers, faculty, research staff and senior scientists of many different nationalities, all of whom are studying or working in computer science, molecular biology, mathematics and/or statistics. The conference brings biologists and computational scientists together to focus on research centered on actual biological problems rather than simply theoretical calculations. The combined focus on ""intelligent systems"" and actual biological data makes ISMB a highly relevant meeting, and many years of producing the event has resulted in a well organized, well attended, and respected annual conference. The ISMB conference presents the latest research methods and results developed through the application of computer programming to the study of biological sciences, including advances in sequencing genomes that may lead to a better understanding of how, for instance, cells interact for the treatment of diseases such as cancer. Additionally, presentations may describe methods and advances associated with the analysis of existing biological literature, including benchmarking experiments, to create a better public understanding of scientific research reports. Overall, ISMB serves to educate attendees on the latest developments that will further drive the research methods and results of the field of computational biology. Students and scientists are able to return to their labs to apply what they have learned as they advance their own research efforts. The scientific program for each ISMB meeting comprises parallel presentation tracks of original research papers, highlights of recently published research, topically focused special sessions on emerging topics, technology demos, tutorial workshops, special interest group meetings and a student symposium organized by and for students. As an example, for ISMB 2010, 234 original research papers were submitted and 48 selected for the Proceedings Track; 126 published papers were submitted and 42 selected for the Highlights Track; nine proposals were submitted and four selected for presentation along with two invited for the Special Sessions Track. In all, well over 200 talks were presented during the course of the 2010 conference, and similar numbers are anticipated for 2011. In all cases, submissions are rigorously reviewed, typically by three members of each track's committee before approval by the track chair, insuring the highest possible quality of work is presented. The specific areas represented in the conference vary each year depending on the areas that researchers find most interesting and innovative, and therefore submit as papers and proposals. This proposal seeks funding to assist students and junior researchers in attending the conference, thus exposing them to the latest research of their own areas as well as areas that may be new to them.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems. The widespread recognition of bioinformatics has been largely driven by genomic sequence efforts, because laboratory scientists recognize that the usefulness of genomic data in the quest to develop new and improved treatments for and prevention of disease is highly dependent on one's ability to electronically access and manipulate it. Biologists are routinely integrating computational tools into their research programs and creating large predictive models based on information found in databases and other electronic resources. The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference series directly addresses these questions by showcasing the latest advances in the field, as well as exposing what's on the horizon of future discoveries.           Relevance Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems.

"A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis SUMMARY The requirement for a trained user to interact with tissue and images is a long-standing impediment to higher throughput analysis of biological microstructures using unbiased stereology, the state-of-the-art method for accurate quantification of biological structure. Phase 1 studies addressed this limitation with Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis (VCS), an innovative approach for automatic stereological analysis that improves throughput efficiency by 6-9 fold compared to conventional computerized stereology. Work in Phase 2 integrated VCS into the Stereologer"", an integrated hardware-software-microscopy system for stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images. Validation studies of first-order stereological parameters. i.e., volume, surface area, length, number, confirmed that the color-based detection methods in the VCS approach achieve accurate results for automatic stereological analysis of high S:N biological microstructures. These studies indicate that fully automatic stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images can be realized by elimination of two remaining barriers, which will be addressed in this Phase II Continuation Competing Renewal. In Aim 1, applications for feature extraction and microstructure classification, developed in part with funding from the Office of Naval Research, will be integrated into the VCS program. The new application (VCS II) will use these approaches to automatically detect and classify polymorphic microstructures of biological interest using a range of feature calculations, including size, color, border, shape, and texture, with support from active learning and Support Vector Machines. Work in Aim 2 will eliminate physical handling of glass slides during computerized stereology studies by equipping the Stereologer system with automatic slide loading/unloading technology controlled by the Stereologer system. This technology will approximately double the throughput efficiency of the current VCS program and support ""human-in-the-loop"" interaction for sample microstructures on the border between two or more adjacent classes. The studies in Aim 3 will rigorously test the hypothesis that fully automatic VCS can quantify first- and second-order stereological parameters, without a loss of accuracy compared to the current gold-standard - non-automatic computerized stereology, e.g., manual Stereologer. If these studies validate the accuracy of VCS II, then commercialization of the fully automatic program will facilitate the throughout efficiency for testing scientific hypotheses in a wide variety of biomedical research projects; reduce labor costs for computerized stereology studies; hasten the growth of our understanding of biological processes that underlie health, longevity, and disease; and accelerate the development of novel approaches for the therapeutic management of human disease. Solid evidence that the SRC and its strategic partners can effectively commercialize this technology is demonstrated by their worldwide sales and support of the Stereologer system for the past 13 years.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials. We propose to study novel methods for analyzing the large-scale biomedical data to realize their full potential of molecular diagnosis and prognosis of transplant rejection prediction for critical early treatment.          n/a",Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data,8079474,R01GM083345,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Experimental Designs', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Graft Rejection', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Oncogene Activation', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer microarray', 'cancer type', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney allograft', 'method development', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'theories', 'transplant database', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2011,250488,-0.06873887134185583
"Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this grant project is the development and pre-validation of the Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt), a tiered testing strategy consisting of a battery of four alternative ocular irritancy assays, which will replace regulatory mandated acute ocular irritation testing using the Draize Rabbit Eye test. ROBatt consists of the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Assay (BCOP), the Chorioallantoic Membrane Vascular Assay using 10-day fertile chicken eggs (CAMVA), the Porcine Corneal Reversibility Assay (PorCORA) and the Porcine Confocal Assay (PorFocal). This tiered strategy follows a decision tree that allows for a thorough interrogation of possible ocular irritants. Although four assays are recommended, in most cases only two or three will be used depending on the degree of irritation. The Specific Aim of the ROBatt project is to validate the decision tree variables using at least 50 chemicals listed in the European Center for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) data bank, including Corrosive (EEC R41, GHS/EPA Cat 1), Severe (EEC R36, GHS CaL 2, HMIS 2), Moderate (EPA Cat. 3, HMIS 2), Mild (HMIS 1) and Non-irritating (EPA Cat 4, HMIS 0). The long-term project goal is to submit the ROBatt testing strategy to iCCVAM/ECVAM for consideration as a standalone alternative to the Draize Rabbit Eye test. Validation and acceptance of the ROBatt testing strategy will significantly reduce the number of rabbits used in the toxicological assessment of consumer products, chemicals and raw materials by replacing rabbits with four robust alternative assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ocular irritation testing is extremely relevant to assuring adequate safety levels of public health as new formulations of chemicals and products are introduced. In most cases, these safety assessments are performed using the Draize Rabbit Eye test, resulting in thousands of rabbits used in testing every year.

"Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this three-year project, we aim to apply state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine (EBM) and comparative effectiveness reviews. We plan to develop a human guided computerized abstract screening tool to greatly reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. This tool will combine proven machine learning techniques with a new open source tool that enables management of the screening process. This new technology will enable investigators to screen abstracts in a small fraction of the time compared to the current manual process. It will reduce the time and cost of producing systematic reviews, provide clear documentation of the process and potentially perform the task more accurately. With the acceptance of EBM and increasing demands for systematic reviews, there is a great need for tools to assist in generating new systematic reviews and in updating them. This need cannot be more pressing. The recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the $1.1 billion allocated for comparative effectiveness research have created an unprecedented need for systematic reviews and opportunities to improve the methodologies and efficiency of their conduct.   We herein propose the development of novel, open-source software to help systematic reviewers better   cope with these torrents of data. The research and development of this tool will be carried out by a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators with computer scientists at Tufts University who began to collaborate last year as a result of Tufts being awarded one of the NIH Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We will pursue dissemination of the new technology through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, Cochrane Collaboration, CTSA network, and other groups conducting systematic reviews, and production of tutorial material. Our aims are:   1. Conduct research to design and implement a semi-automated system using machine learning and   information retrieval methods to identify relevant abstracts in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of systematic reviews.   2. Develop Abstrackr, an open-source system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for screening abstracts, that applies the methods developed in Aim 1 to automatically exclude irrelevant abstracts/articles.   3. Evaluate the performance of the active learning model developed in Aim 1 and the functionality of   Abstrackr developed in Aim 2 through application to a collection of manually screened datasets of   biomedical abstracts that will subsequently be made publicly available for use as a repository to spur   research in the machine learning and information retrieval communities.           Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making. Systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming.

The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium is an international collaboration of model organism database and genome annotation groups who have joined together to establish standards for describing genomes and gene products and to provide tools and support for the consistent application of these standards for functional annotations that facilitate and enable biological research. The GO provides specific classifications including well-defined, biologically descriptive terms that are organized into specialization and part-of hierarchies for the domains of genome feature, molecular function, biological process and cellular component. The GO classifications are independent of any particular technology, an uncoupling of terminology from technology that encourages application of these semantic standards by organism annotation groups that utilize a wide range of technical environments. The GO has been widely adopted and used for representation of complex biological information for model organism genomes, and is increasingly used for the functional annotation of emerging genomes. With the increased use of the GO, the Consortium must actively work to ensure both the accuracy of the ontologies as well as consistency and quality of annotations so that these resources may be reliably used to draw inferences and make biological predictions. We will do so by focusing on four key aims: 1) We will maintain logically rigorous and biologically precise ontologies; 2) We will ensure comprehensive annotation of reference genomes, including human, using the GO; 3) We will support GO annotation efforts for emerging genomes and for those specialized sets of genes and proteins of particular community interest; and 4) We will provide annotations and tools to the research community thus supporting experimental biologists, genome informaticists, and computational biologists who are using GO annotations in their research particularly in the areas of functional genomics and comparative biology. The relevance of this work for public health is that comprehensive integration and standardization of biomedical and genomics information is an essential component of advancing the understanding of the molecular systems underlying human health and disease outcomes.             n/a",Gene Ontology Consortium,8061704,P41HG002273,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comparative Biology', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'EST Library', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Translating', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'comparative', 'data format', 'empowered', 'functional genomics', 'genetic element', 'human disease', 'information model', 'interest', 'model organisms databases', 'repository', 'tool']",NHGRI,JACKSON LABORATORY,P41,2011,2923298,-0.031129998557510967
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies. We plan to extend the Protigi ontology editor-the most widely used ontology editor today, with almost 100,000 registered users-to support collaborative development of ontologies and to evaluate the new tools by deploying them at the World Health Organization for the development of ICD-11 and in other settings.             n/a",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,8039246,R01GM086587,"['Adopted', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Published Comment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Systems Development', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'conflict resolution', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forging', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,526649,-0.01700930584690811

"HealthMap: Knowledge Management for Emerging Infectious Disease Intelligence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Even as many developed countries strengthen their traditional clinically-based surveillance capacity, a basic level of health information infrastructure is still lacking in many parts of the developing world, including areas that are most vulnerable to emerging health threats. To help fill this gap, electronic news outlets, disease reporting networks, discussion sites, and blogs are proving to be invaluable data sources for a new generation of public health surveillance systems that operate across international borders- almost all major outbreaks investigated by WHO, including SARS, are first identified by these informal online sources. These data sources provide local and timely information about disease outbreaks and related events around the world, including areas relatively invisible to day-to-day global public health efforts due to lack of infrastructure or political suppression of information. However, since this information is dispersed and largely unstructured, there is lack of organization and integration between sources, precluding a global view of all ongoing disease threats. In order to construct such an integrated view of current emerging infections, we deployed an early prototype called Health Map, a freely available multi-stream real-time knowledge management system that aggregates and maps health alerts across numerous key data sources, including WHO alerts, newswires, mailing lists. Leveraging our previous National Library of Medicine funded work in real-time health monitoring; we propose extensive development of this new digital resource to address technological and methodological barriers to achieving a synthesized, comprehensive, and customized view of global health. The principal objective of Health Map development is to provide access to the greatest amount of possibly useful information across the widest variety of geographical areas and disease agents, without overwhelming the user with an excess of information, or obscuring important and urgent elements. We will specifically address the challenge of providing structure to unstructured data while still enabling the astute user to notice the subtle pattern that could be an early indication of a significant outbreak. Development of Health Map will proceed along the four key components of surveillance: (1) data acquisition (evaluation and integration of multiple electronic sources) (2) information characterization (disease and location categorization and severity rating of unstructured data), (3) signal interpretation (multi-stream signal detection, spatiotemporal modeling and risk assessment) and (4) knowledge dissemination (tiered dissemination of global infectious disease alerts and flexible data visualization tools). In each area, we will make critical enhancements to the existing prototype. We plan rigorous evaluation to ensure that Health Map successfully leverages electronic sources for surveillance, communication, and intervention. We will also conduct comprehensive user testing, usability studies, user behavior analysis as part of our effort. Our goal is to make Health Map a vital knowledge resource tailored for both the general public and public health decision-makers.        Although an enormous amount of information about current infectious disease outbreaks is found in Web- accessible information sources, this information is dispersed and not well-organized, making it almost impossible for public health officials and concerned citizens to know about all ongoing emerging disease threats.

"Automated Salivary Gland Dissection for Manufacture of Malaria PfSPZ Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sanaria was founded in 2003 to develop and commercialize an attenuated sporozoite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) (PfSPZ) vaccine against malaria. Since then Sanaria has established a manufacturing process, manufactured the PfSPZ Vaccine under cGMPs, submitted an investigational new drug application (IND) to the FDA, received clearance from the FDA to proceed to clinical trials, and initiated the first Phase 1 clinical trial to assess safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of SANARIA PfSPZ Vaccine in May 2009. The PfSPZ vaccine is comprised of Pf sporozoites extracted from infected mosquitoes and a short term challenge for Sanaria involves the optimization of this extraction step in its manufacturing process. Currently, human operators manually carry out the critical task of isolating the sporozoites by serially dissecting salivary glands from individual mosquitoes. Sanaria has established this procedure as a reliable, reproducible, consistent, and efficient process. In the next phase of development, as we optimize the efficiency and expand the scale of vaccine manufacturing, automation of mosquito dissection will prove to be beneficial on several fronts. It will enable us to cut the costs of supporting a large taskforce of skilled technicians, the time taken to train and qualify them and the dedicated space necessary for a scaled-up manual operation. Therefore in this SBIR proposal, we focus on successfully developing strategies to mechanize the process of dissection and collection of mosquito salivary glands. In collaboration with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University we propose to develop novel instrumentation and innovative technologies to meet this goal. These will be addressed in three specific aims in which we will develop procedures that will allow batch processing of mosquitoes to isolate intact salivary glands with minimal manual involvement. This will be achieved using mechanical engineering and physical chemistry principles. First, in specific aim 1 we will create ordered arrays of mosquitoes and in specific aim 2 we will develop methods to decapitate mosquitoes and to extract and collect the salivary glands without losing sporozoites. The technology described here is expected to achieve very high throughput and process scalability. In specific aim 3 we propose a direct substitution of our current dissection configuration with robotic arms and vision guided microscope systems. This serial processing approach will circumvent the need to create mosquito assemblies and involves limited, if any, manual operation. The end-product from the advanced automated techniques however must match or exceed Sanaria's current standards for vaccine yield and potency and will drive the decision to translate our current method of mosquito salivary gland dissection to an automated platform.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria causes >300 million clinical cases and 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel. Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize a >90% protective malaria vaccine for three primary markets with a potential for >$1 billion annual revenues: 1) Travelers from the developed world to malaria endemic areas. 2) Infants and young children in the developing world. 3) Adolescent girls in the developing world. Success in this Phase I SBIR will lead to a significant increase in the efficiency of manufacture of the PfSPZ Vaccine that will facilitate scale-up of manufacturing and significantly reduce the cost of goods.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Malaria causes >300 million clinical cases and 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel.

"Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Classification methods applied to microarray data have largely been those developed by the machine learning community, since the large p (number of covariates) problem is inherent in high-throughput genomic experiments. The random forest (RF) methodology has been demonstrated to be competitive with other machine learning approaches (e.g., neural networks and support vector machines). Apart from improved accuracy, a clear advantage of the RF method in comparison to most machine learning approaches is that variable importance measures are provided by the algorithm. Therefore, one can assess the relative importance each gene has on the predictive model. In a large number of applications, the class to be predicted may be inherently ordinal. Examples of ordinal responses include TNM stage (I,II,III, IV); drug toxicity (none, mild, moderate, severe); or response to treatment classified as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. These responses are ordinal; while there is an inherent ordering among the responses, there is no known underlying numerical relationship between them. While one can apply standard nominal response methods to ordinal response data, in so doing one loses the ordered information inherent in the data. Since ordinal classification methods have been largely neglected in the machine learning literature, the specific aims of this proposal are to (1) extend the recursive partitioning and RF methodologies for predicting an ordinal response by developing computational tools for the R programming environment; (2) evaluate the proposed ordinal classification methods against alternative methods using simulated, benchmark, and gene expression datasets; (3) develop and evaluate methods for assessing variable importance when interest is in predicting an ordinal response. Novel splitting criteria for classification tree growing and methods for estimating variable importance are proposed, which appropriately take the nature of the ordinal response into consideration. In addition, the Generalized Gini index and ordered twoing methods will be studied under the ensemble learning framework, which has not been previously conducted. This project is significant to the scientific community since the ordinal classification methods to be made available from this project will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect responses on an ordinal scale.           n/a",Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response,8049892,R03LM009347,"['Algorithms', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Drug toxicity', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Image Analysis', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Northern Blotting', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Relative (related person)', 'Simulate', 'Stable Disease', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Trees', 'computerized tools', 'forest', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'neglect', 'novel', 'partial response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tumor']",NLM,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R03,2010,5742,-0.013006647967483902
"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The common goals to many, if not all, biomedical research programs are the development of tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. These programs often rely on new types of data that have an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Our goal is to produce software for the analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies to enable researchers who are dependent on computational tools to have the ability to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data.          n/a",Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing,8013208,R44GM083965,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arts', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cations', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Grouping', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Program Development', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Scheme', 'Simulate', 'Software Design', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Voting', 'Work', 'base', 'computer cluster', 'computerized tools', 'data mining', 'design', 'forest', 'improved', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'parallel computing', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'response', 'software development', 'sound', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,INSILICOS,R44,2010,376899,0.01479563576556501
"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software. Furthermore, computational strategies will be explored based on global optimization techniques, particularly convex programming and difference convex programming.           n/a",New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data,7881671,R01GM081535,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'information classification', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2010,264640,-0.010537516222821874
"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC) proposal aims to provide a flexible analysis resource for the ENCODE project. The ENCODE project is a large multi center project which aims to define all the functional elements in the human genome. This will be achieved using many different experimental techniques coupled with numerous computational techniques. A critical part in delivering this set of functional elements is the integration of data from multiple sources. The ED AC proposal aims to provide this integration. As proscribed by the RFA for this proposal, the precise prioritization for the EDAC's work will be set by an external group, the Analysis Working Group (AWG). Based on previous experience, these analysis methods will require a variety of techniques. We expect to have to apply sophisticated statistical models to the integration of the data, in particular mitigating the problems of the extensive heterogeneity and correlation of variables on the human genome. We have statistical experts who can use the large size of the human genome, coupled with a limited number of sensible assumptions to produce statistical techniques which are robust to this considerable heterogeneity.

"National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions.         n/a",National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI),8110238,U54CA121852,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genomics', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Pathway', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'graphical user interface', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'software systems', 'structural biology', 'tool', 'usability']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2010,29814,-0.01165943131229927
"Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use light/fluorescence microscopes to image cells and other biological samples. There is strong and growing demand for software to analyze these images, as automated microscopes collect images faster than can be examined by eye and the information sought from images is increasingly quantitative and complex.  We have begun to address this demand with CellProfiler, a versatile, open-source software tool for quantifying data from biological images, particularly in high-throughput experiments (www.cellprofiler.org). CellProfiler can extract valuable biological information from images quickly while increasing the objectivity and statistical power of assays. In the three years since its release, it has become widely used, having been downloaded more than 8,000 times by users in over 60 countries. Using CellProfiler's point-and-click interface, researchers build a customized chain of image analysis modules to identify and measure biological objects in images. The software evolved in an intensely collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment with dozens of ongoing projects and has been successfully applied to a wide range of biological samples and assays, from counting cells to scoring complex phenotypes by machine learning.  To enable further biological imaging research, meet the needs of the growing user base, and expand the community that benefits from CellProfiler, we propose to improve its capabilities, interface, and support:  First, we will add user-requested capabilities, leveraging existing open-source projects by interoperating with them where feasible. These new features will include object tracking in time-lapse movies, compatibility with additional file formats, new image processing algorithms, and expanded tools for quality control, performance evaluation, cluster computing, and workflow management.  Second, we will improve the interface, increase processing speed, and simplify the addition of new features by refactoring and porting the MATLAB-based code to an open-source language and instituting proven software development practices.  Third, we will provide user, educator, and developer support and outreach for CellProfiler. These activities will facilitate research in the scientific community and help guide usability improvements.  These improvements to the only open-source software for modular, high-throughput biological image analysis will enable hundreds of NIH-funded laboratories to make high-impact biological discoveries from cell images across all disciplines within biology. Most laboratories studying biological processes and human disease use microscopy to analyze cells and  other samples. We will enable these researchers to rapidly and accurately extract numerical data from  microscopy images by continuing to develop and support our user-friendly, open-source cell image  analysis software, CellProfiler (www.cellprofiler.org).",Continued development of CellProfiler cell image analysis software,7761085,R01GM089652,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Process Measure', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'cluster computing', 'file format', 'fluorescence microscope', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'movie', 'open source', 'outreach', 'processing speed', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'research study', 'resource guides', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2010,463608,-0.01260977076305516
"Stochastic dynamics for multiscale biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Complex biological systems are increasingly subject to investigation by mathematical modeling in general and stochastic simulation in particular. Advanced mathematical methods will be used to generate next-generation computational methods and algorithms for (1) formulating these models, (2) simulating or sampling their stochastic dynamics, (3) reducing them to simpler approximating models for use in multiscale simulation, and (4) optimizing their unknown or partly known parameters to fit observed behaviors and/or measurements. The proposed methods are based on advances in applied statistical and stochastic mathematics, including advances arising from operator algebra, quantum field theory, stochastic processes, statistical physics, machine learning, and related mathematically grounded fields. A central technique in this work will be the use of the operator algebra formulation of the chemical master equation.       The biological systems to be studied include and are representative of high-value biomedical target systems whose complexity and spatiotemporal scale requires improved mathematical and computational methods, to obtain the scientific understanding underlying future medical intervention. Cancer research is broadly engaged in signal transduction systems and complexes with feedback, for which the yeast Ste5 MARK pathway is a model system. DNA damage sensing (through ATM) and repair control (though p53 and Mdm2) are at least equally important to cancer research owing to the central role that failure of these systems play in many cancers. The dendritic spine synapse system is central to neuroplasticity and therefore human learning and memory. It is critical to understand this neurobiological system well enough to protect it against neurodegenerative diseases and environmental insults. The project seeks fundamental mathematical breakthroughs in stochastic and multiscale modeling that will enable the scientific understanding of these complex systems necessary to create effective medical interventions of the future.           n/a",Stochastic dynamics for multiscale biology,7912919,R01GM086883,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Damage', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Formulations', 'Equation', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Future', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'M cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reaction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological systems', 'complex biological systems', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'models and simulation', 'multi-scale modeling', 'next generation', 'novel', 'quantum', 'reaction rate', 'repaired', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'syntax', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2010,304151,-0.010847132782544046
"Rational design of cytokine releasing angiogenic constructs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of organized vascular networks necessitates a tightly regulated interplay between variable cells, growth factors and soluble mediators. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop therapeutic angiogenic strategies based on the rational design of cytokine releasing constructs that promote vascular patterning and vessel stability. The objective of this proposal is to i) develop electrospun, three-dimensional constructs with patterned architecture, ii) demonstrate that the spatial and temporal delivery of two model angiogenic growth factors promotes the formation of an organized capillary network and iii) develop a computational model that can predict the biological effect of a growth factor releasing construct as a function of specified fabrication parameters.

"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide. The continuity of the system will be ensured by codifying human subjects-sensitive policies and procedures into Departmental regulations and by charging researchers modest fees for specimens, data and other research services.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a research-ready pregnancy and newborn biobank in California This proposal funds infrastructure development to create a research-ready, efficient, high- throughput, and low-cost prenatal and newborn biobank in California.

"Prediction of influenza antigenic variants using a novel sparse multitask learnin    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza and influenza related complication lead to more than 200,000 hospitalizations and approximately 36,000 deaths in the United States each year, and vaccination is the primary option for reducing influenza effect. A large amount of global efforts has to be made each year to identify antigenic variants and decide whether new vaccine strains are needed. Current laboratory based antigenic characterization processes are labor intensive and time consuming, and it has been the bottleneck for generating an effective influenza vaccination program. A robust method without such a laboratory characterization is demanding for rapid identification of influenza antigenic variants. This project proposes to develop a novel sparse multitask learning method in predicting influenza antigenic variants solely based on the input of protein sequences, and further to apply this method in mapping antigenic drift pathway of A/H3N2 influenza viruses and studying antigenic drift patterns leading to influenza outbreaks. This method is based on the assumption that influenza antigenicity would be determined by certain features in hemagglutinin (HA) protein sequence and tertiary structure. This assumption was well evidenced that the viruses with conserved HAs generated cross-reactions in serological reactions and also provided cross- protection in both laboratory experiments and field practices. The proposed method is novel since it combines multitask learning and sparse learning. Therefore not only this project will develop significant technology for antigenic variant screen, but also new machine learning methods. This project will facilitate vaccine strain selection since the proposed method can potentially reduce and even eliminate serological assay, one of the most labor intensive procedures, in influenza surveillance. In addition, the antigenicity specific features and the drift patterns causing influenza outbreaks to be identified in this study will enhance our understanding about antigen-antibody interaction thus enhance our knowledge in influenza immunology and serology. Furthermore, the proposed method is potentially applicable in characterizing antigenic properties of other pathogens with significant antigenic variations, for example, rotavirus. The specific aims are the following: (1) Development of a novel sparse multitask learning method in generating antigenic distance matrix using hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) data; (2) Development of a quantitative method for predicting antigenic variants in silicon; (3) Application of this method in studying seasonal influenza antigenic drift pathway and antigenic drift patterns leading to influenza outbreaks. This nature of this study is to address a novel predictive method for measuring antigenic divergence between influenza viruses, which is critical in influenza vaccine strain selection. Thus, we are submitting this project to the broad challenge area (06) Enabling Technologies and fit for the Specific Challenge 06-GM-103: development of predictive method for molecular structure, recognition, and ligand interaction.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is to develop a novel computational method for influenza antigenic variant prediction, which is very useful in influenza vaccine strain selection.

"Efficient software and algorithms for analyzing markers data on general pedigree    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to develop an efficient, extensible, modular, and accessible software toolbox that facilitates statistical methods for analyzing complex pedigrees. The toolbox will consist of novel algorithms that extend state of the art algorithms from graph theory, statistics, artificial intelligence, and genetics. This tool will enhance capabilities to analyze genetic components of inherited diseases. The specific aim of this project is to develop an extensible software system for efficiently computing pedigree likelihood for complex diseases in the presence of multiple polymorphic markers, and SNP markers, in fully general pedigrees taking into account qualitative (discrete) and quantitative traits and a variety of disease models. Our experience shows that by building on top of the insight gained within the last decade from the study of computational probability, in particular, from the theory of probabilistic networks, we can construct a software system whose functionality, speed, and extensibility is unmatched by current linkage software. We plan to integrate these new methods into an existing linkage analysis software, called superlink, which is already gaining momentum for analyzing large pedigrees. We will also continue to work with several participating genetic units in research hospitals and improve the software quality and reliability as we proceed with algorithmic improvements. In this project we will develop novel algorithms for more efficient likelihood calculations and more efficient maximization algorithms for the most general pedigrees. These algorithms will remove redundancy due to determinism, use cashing of partial results effectively, and determine close-to-optimal order of operations taking into account these enhancements. Time-space trade-offs will be computed that allow to use memory space in the most effective way, and to automatically determine on which portions of a complex pedigree exact computations are infeasible. In such cases, a combination of exact computations with intelligent use of approximation techniques, such as variational methods and sampling, will be employed. In particular we will focus on advancing sampling schemes such as MCMC used in the Morgan program and integrating it with exact computation. A serious effort will be devoted for quality control, interface design, and integration with complementing available software with the active help of current users of Superlink and Morgan. PUBLIC SUMMARY: The availability of extensive DMA measurements and new computational techniques provides the opportunity to decipher genetic components of inherited diseases.

"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          n/a",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,7929664,R01LM009719,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Human Genome Project', 'Improve Access', 'International', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Writing', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'repository', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,277200,-0.022080245470145147
"A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis SUMMARY The requirement for a trained user to interact with tissue and images is a long-standing impediment to higher throughput analysis of biological microstructures using unbiased stereology, the state-of-the-art method for accurate quantification of biological structure. Phase 1 studies addressed this limitation with Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis (VCS), an innovative approach for automatic stereological analysis that improves throughput efficiency by 6-9 fold compared to conventional computerized stereology. Work in Phase 2 integrated VCS into the Stereologer"", an integrated hardware-software-microscopy system for stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images. Validation studies of first-order stereological parameters. i.e., volume, surface area, length, number, confirmed that the color-based detection methods in the VCS approach achieve accurate results for automatic stereological analysis of high S:N biological microstructures. These studies indicate that fully automatic stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images can be realized by elimination of two remaining barriers, which will be addressed in this Phase II Continuation Competing Renewal. In Aim 1, applications for feature extraction and microstructure classification, developed in part with funding from the Office of Naval Research, will be integrated into the VCS program. The new application (VCS II) will use these approaches to automatically detect and classify polymorphic microstructures of biological interest using a range of feature calculations, including size, color, border, shape, and texture, with support from active learning and Support Vector Machines. Work in Aim 2 will eliminate physical handling of glass slides during computerized stereology studies by equipping the Stereologer system with automatic slide loading/unloading technology controlled by the Stereologer system. This technology will approximately double the throughput efficiency of the current VCS program and support ""human-in-the-loop"" interaction for sample microstructures on the border between two or more adjacent classes. The studies in Aim 3 will rigorously test the hypothesis that fully automatic VCS can quantify first- and second-order stereological parameters, without a loss of accuracy compared to the current gold-standard - non-automatic computerized stereology, e.g., manual Stereologer. If these studies validate the accuracy of VCS II, then commercialization of the fully automatic program will facilitate the throughout efficiency for testing scientific hypotheses in a wide variety of biomedical research projects; reduce labor costs for computerized stereology studies; hasten the growth of our understanding of biological processes that underlie health, longevity, and disease; and accelerate the development of novel approaches for the therapeutic management of human disease. Solid evidence that the SRC and its strategic partners can effectively commercialize this technology is demonstrated by their worldwide sales and support of the Stereologer system for the past 13 years.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software with Automated Gating    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flow cytometry is used to rapidly gather large quantities of data on cell type and function. The manual process of classifying hundreds of thousands of cells forms a bottleneck in diagnostics, high-throughput screening, clinical trials, and large-scale research experiments. The process currently requires a trained technician to identify populations on a digital graph of the data by manually drawing regions. As the complexity of the data increases, this gating task becomes more lengthy and laborious, and it is increasingly clear that minimizing human processing is essential to increasing both throughput and consistency. In clinical tests and diagnostic environments, automated gating would eliminate a complex set of human instructions and decisions in the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), thereby reducing error and speeding results to the doctor. In many cases, the software will be able to recognize the need for additional tests before the doctor has an opportunity to look at the first report. Currently no software is available to perform complex multi-parameter analyses in an automated and rigorously validated manner. FlowDx will fill an important gap in the evolution of the technology and pave the way for ever larger phenotypic studies and for the translation of this research process to a clinical environment. Specific Aims 1) Fully define the experimental protocol, whereby a researcher can compare two or more classifications of identical data sets to study the differences, biases and effectiveness of human and algorithmic classifiers. 2) Describe and evaluate metrics that compare the performance of classification algorithms. 3) Conduct analytical experiments on our identified use cases, illustrating the potential of this technique to affect clinical analysis. 4) Iteratively implement the tools to automate these experiments, improve the experimental capabilities, and collaborate in new use cases. These aims will be satisfied while maintaining quantitative standards of software quality, establishing measurements in system uptime, throughput and robustness to set the baseline for subsequent iterations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FlowDx, a Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software Project is designed to create a new, more efficient, and more effective way of analyzing cells for the presence of cancer, HIV/ AIDS, and other diseases, using a fully automated software system.

"Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this grant project is the development and pre-validation of the Replacement Ocular Battery (ROBatt), a tiered testing strategy consisting of a battery of four alternative ocular irritancy assays, which will replace regulatory mandated acute ocular irritation testing using the Draize Rabbit Eye test. ROBatt consists of the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Assay (BCOP), the Chorioallantoic Membrane Vascular Assay using 10-day fertile chicken eggs (CAMVA), the Porcine Corneal Reversibility Assay (PorCORA) and the Porcine Confocal Assay (PorFocal). This tiered strategy follows a decision tree that allows for a thorough interrogation of possible ocular irritants. Although four assays are recommended, in most cases only two or three will be used depending on the degree of irritation. The Specific Aim of the ROBatt project is to validate the decision tree variables using at least 50 chemicals listed in the European Center for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) data bank, including Corrosive (EEC R41, GHS/EPA Cat 1), Severe (EEC R36, GHS CaL 2, HMIS 2), Moderate (EPA Cat. 3, HMIS 2), Mild (HMIS 1) and Non-irritating (EPA Cat 4, HMIS 0). The long-term project goal is to submit the ROBatt testing strategy to iCCVAM/ECVAM for consideration as a standalone alternative to the Draize Rabbit Eye test. Validation and acceptance of the ROBatt testing strategy will significantly reduce the number of rabbits used in the toxicological assessment of consumer products, chemicals and raw materials by replacing rabbits with four robust alternative assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ocular irritation testing is extremely relevant to assuring adequate safety levels of public health as new formulations of chemicals and products are introduced. In most cases, these safety assessments are performed using the Draize Rabbit Eye test, resulting in thousands of rabbits used in testing every year.

"Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this three-year project, we aim to apply state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine (EBM) and comparative effectiveness reviews. We plan to develop a human guided computerized abstract screening tool to greatly reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. This tool will combine proven machine learning techniques with a new open source tool that enables management of the screening process. This new technology will enable investigators to screen abstracts in a small fraction of the time compared to the current manual process. It will reduce the time and cost of producing systematic reviews, provide clear documentation of the process and potentially perform the task more accurately. With the acceptance of EBM and increasing demands for systematic reviews, there is a great need for tools to assist in generating new systematic reviews and in updating them. This need cannot be more pressing. The recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the $1.1 billion allocated for comparative effectiveness research have created an unprecedented need for systematic reviews and opportunities to improve the methodologies and efficiency of their conduct.   We herein propose the development of novel, open-source software to help systematic reviewers better   cope with these torrents of data. The research and development of this tool will be carried out by a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators with computer scientists at Tufts University who began to collaborate last year as a result of Tufts being awarded one of the NIH Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We will pursue dissemination of the new technology through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, Cochrane Collaboration, CTSA network, and other groups conducting systematic reviews, and production of tutorial material. Our aims are:   1. Conduct research to design and implement a semi-automated system using machine learning and   information retrieval methods to identify relevant abstracts in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of systematic reviews.   2. Develop Abstrackr, an open-source system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for screening abstracts, that applies the methods developed in Aim 1 to automatically exclude irrelevant abstracts/articles.   3. Evaluate the performance of the active learning model developed in Aim 1 and the functionality of   Abstrackr developed in Aim 2 through application to a collection of manually screened datasets of   biomedical abstracts that will subsequently be made publicly available for use as a repository to spur   research in the machine learning and information retrieval communities.           Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making. Systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to build a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care.",Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews,7933715,R01HS018494,[' '],AHRQ,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2010,388462,-0.004364798521262574
"Gene Ontology Consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our objective is to provide the scientific community with a consistent, robust information environment for describing, sharing, integrating and comparing the functional roles of genes, proteins and functional RNAs within and across all organisms. The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium is an international collaboration of model organism database and genome annotation groups who have joined together to establish standards for describing genomes and gene products and to provide tools and support for the consistent application of these standards for functional annotations that facilitate and enable biological research. The GO provides specific classifications including well-defined, biologically descriptive terms that are organized into specialization and part-of hierarchies for the domains of genome feature, molecular function, biological process and cellular component. The GO classifications are independent of any particular technology, an uncoupling of terminology from technology that encourages application of these semantic standards by organism annotation groups that utilize a wide range of technical environments. The GO has been widely adopted and used for representation of complex biological information for model organism genomes, and is increasingly used for the functional annotation of emerging genomes. With the increased use of the GO, the Consortium must actively work to ensure both the accuracy of the ontologies as well as consistency and quality of annotations so that these resources may be reliably used to draw inferences and make biological predictions. We will do so by focusing on four key aims: 1) We will maintain logically rigorous and biologically precise ontologies; 2) We will ensure comprehensive annotation of reference genomes, including human, using the GO; 3) We will support GO annotation efforts for emerging genomes and for those specialized sets of genes and proteins of particular community interest; and 4) We will provide annotations and tools to the research community thus supporting experimental biologists, genome informaticists, and computational biologists who are using GO annotations in their research particularly in the areas of functional genomics and comparative biology.

"Enhancing 3dsvm to improve its interoperability and dissemination    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research plan outlines crucial software enhancements to a program called 3dsvm, which is a command line program and graphical user interface (gui) plugin for AFNI (Cox, 1996). 3dsvm performs support vector machine (SVM) analysis on fMRI data, which constitutes one important approach to performing multivariate supervised learning of neuroimaging data. 3dsvm originally provided the ability to analyze fMRI data as described in (LaConte et al., 2005). Since its first distribution as a part of AFNI, it has been steadily extended to provide new functionality including regression and non-linear kernels, as well as multiclass classification capabilities. In addition to its integration into AFNI, features that make 3dsvm particularly well suited for fMRI analysis are that it is easy to spatially mask voxels (to include/exclude them in the SVM analysis) as well as to flexibly select subsets of a dataset to use as training or testing samples. It has been used to generate results for our own work and for collaborative efforts and has been cited as a resource by others (Mur et al. 2009; Hanke et al. 2009). Despite many positive aspects of 3dsvm, the priorities of PAR-07-417 address a genuine need that this software project has - the ability to focus on improvements that will increase its dissemination and interoperability. A major motivation for PAR-07-417 is to facilitate the improved interface, characterization, and documentation to enhance the extent of sharing and to provide the groundwork for future extensions. Our aims are well aligned with this program announcement. Further, there is a growing need in the neuroimaging community for tools such as 3dsvm. Since 3dsvm is not a new project, is tightly integrated into the software environment of AFNI, and can be further integrated to enable better functionality to support needs as diverse as NIfTI format capabilities to rtFMRI, this proposed project will help to further the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research by supporting its need for wide-spread adoption of high-quality neuroimaging tools.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal focuses on improving, characterizing, and documenting an existing neuroinformatics software tool.

"A Resource for Biomedical Ontologies and Knowledge Bases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       For more than two decades, our laboratory has been studying technology to develop, manage, and use formal descriptions of biomedical concepts. The result of this work is Protege, a workbench that allows users to edit and apply controlled terminologies, ontologies, and knowledge bases to a wide range of information-management problems. To date, more than 50,000 people have registered as users of the system. Many diverse projects in biomedicine-supported by nearly every institute and center at NIH-have become critically dependent on this software and the knowledge-engineering principles that it supports. This P41 competing renewal application seeks to continue support for Protege, as a biomedical informatics resource that will benefit the system's entire user community.      We propose technology research and development to expand the capabilities of the Protege system to meet the current and anticipated needs of the user community. We will re-engineer Protege with a service-oriented architecture that can adapt to the requirements of new ontology languages, large ontology repositories, and cutting-edge ontology-management-services, such as reasoning, alignment, and evolution. We will create support for collaborative ontology development, in the context of both large, centralized projects and open, decentralized efforts. We also will develop advanced support for using ontologies in application software development and as integral parts of software systems.      As a biomedical informatics resource, we will expand our collaborative research projects with other Prot¿g¿ users. We will provide service to the Protege user community through enhanced technical support, user documentation, tutorials, and workshops.

"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies. We plan to extend the Protigi ontology editor-the most widely used ontology editor today, with almost 100,000 registered users-to support collaborative development of ontologies and to evaluate the new tools by deploying them at the World Health Organization for the development of ICD-11 and in other settings.             n/a",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,7774343,R01GM086587,"['Adopted', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Outsourcing', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Published Comment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'conflict resolution', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forging', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,525262,-0.01700930584690811
"DEVELOPMENT OF DATA ONTOLOGIES FOR INTEGRATING MULTI-CENTER CARDIOVASCULAR STUDIE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia constitute a major public-health burden due to increased mortality and morbidity and rising health care costs. Massive epidemiological data are needed to detect the small effects of many individual genes and the environment on these traits. However, sample sizes needed to make powerful inferences may only be reached by integrating multiple epidemiological studies. Meaningful integration of information from multiple studies requires the development of data ontologies which make it possible to integrate information across studies in an optimum manner so as to maximize the information content and hence the statistical power for detecting small effect sizes. A second compounding problem of data integration is that software applications that manage such study data are typically non-interoperable, i.e. “silos” of data, and are incapable of being shared in a syntactically and semantically meaningful manner. Consequently, an infrastructure that integrates across studies in an interoperable manner is needed to ensure that epidemiological cardiovascular research remains a viable and major player in the biomedical informatics revolution which is currently underway. The cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIGTM) is addressing these problems in the cancer domain by developing software systems that are able to exchange information or that are syntactically interoperable by accessing metadata that is semantically annotated using controlled vocabularies. Our overarching goal is to develop ontologies for integrating cardiovascular epidemiological data from multiple studies. Specifically, we propose three Aims: First, develop cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies for each of three disparate multi-center epidemiological studies that facilitate data integration across the studies and data mining for various phenotypes. Second, adopt a technology infrastructure that leverages the cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies using Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and caBIGTM tools to facilitate the integration and widespread sharing of cardiovascular data sets. Third, facilitate seamless data sharing and promote widespread data dissemination among research communities cutting across clinical, translational and epidemiological domains, primarily through collaboration with the established CardioVascular Research Grid (CVRG). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity which contributes substantially to rising health care costs and consequently constitutes a major public health burden. Therefore, understanding the genetic and environmental effects on these CVD traits is important. Massive epidemiological study data are needed to detect the small individual effects of genes and their interactions, and integration of multiple epidemiological studies are necessary for generating large sample sizes. Unfortunately, integrating information from multiple studies in a meaningful manner requires the development of data ontologies (language and grammar). Our proposal addresses this need, and does this in a way that is informative and user-friendly from the End User’s point of view.",DEVELOPMENT OF DATA ONTOLOGIES FOR INTEGRATING MULTI-CENTER CARDIOVASCULAR STUDIE,7851333,R01HL094286,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Belief', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Family Study', 'Ferrets', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'design', 'experience', 'mortality', 'software development', 'software systems', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,474912,-0.014489198641286614

"National Center: Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet) A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions.   n/a",National Center: Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet),8012947,U54CA121852,[' '],NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2010,3757192,-0.011765732858848783
"HealthMap: Knowledge Management for Emerging Infectious Disease Intelligence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Even as many developed countries strengthen their traditional clinically-based surveillance capacity, a basic level of health information infrastructure is still lacking in many parts of the developing world, including areas that are most vulnerable to emerging health threats. To help fill this gap, electronic news outlets, disease reporting networks, discussion sites, and blogs are proving to be invaluable data sources for a new generation of public health surveillance systems that operate across international borders- almost all major outbreaks investigated by WHO, including SARS, are first identified by these informal online sources. These data sources provide local and timely information about disease outbreaks and related events around the world, including areas relatively invisible to day-to-day global public health efforts due to lack of infrastructure or political suppression of information. However, since this information is dispersed and largely unstructured, there is lack of organization and integration between sources, precluding a global view of all ongoing disease threats. In order to construct such an integrated view of current emerging infections, we deployed an early prototype called Health Map, a freely available multi-stream real-time knowledge management system that aggregates and maps health alerts across numerous key data sources, including WHO alerts, newswires, mailing lists. Leveraging our previous National Library of Medicine funded work in real-time health monitoring; we propose extensive development of this new digital resource to address technological and methodological barriers to achieving a synthesized, comprehensive, and customized view of global health. The principal objective of Health Map development is to provide access to the greatest amount of possibly useful information across the widest variety of geographical areas and disease agents, without overwhelming the user with an excess of information, or obscuring important and urgent elements. We will specifically address the challenge of providing structure to unstructured data while still enabling the astute user to notice the subtle pattern that could be an early indication of a significant outbreak. Development of Health Map will proceed along the four key components of surveillance: (1) data acquisition (evaluation and integration of multiple electronic sources) (2) information characterization (disease and location categorization and severity rating of unstructured data), (3) signal interpretation (multi-stream signal detection, spatiotemporal modeling and risk assessment) and (4) knowledge dissemination (tiered dissemination of global infectious disease alerts and flexible data visualization tools). In each area, we will make critical enhancements to the existing prototype. We plan rigorous evaluation to ensure that Health Map successfully leverages electronic sources for surveillance, communication, and intervention. We will also conduct comprehensive user testing, usability studies, user behavior analysis as part of our effort. Our goal is to make Health Map a vital knowledge resource tailored for both the general public and public health decision-makers.        Although an enormous amount of information about current infectious disease outbreaks is found in Web- accessible information sources, this information is dispersed and not well-organized, making it almost impossible for public health officials and concerned citizens to know about all ongoing emerging disease threats. Through rigorous development of our online HealthMap system, we plan to provide a synthesized, timely and comprehensive view of current global infectious disease outbreaks by acquiring, integrating and disseminating a wide variety of Internet-based information sources.

"Automated Salivary Gland Dissection for Manufacture of Malaria PfSPZ Vaccine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sanaria was founded in 2003 to develop and commercialize an attenuated sporozoite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) (PfSPZ) vaccine against malaria. Since then Sanaria has established a manufacturing process, manufactured the PfSPZ Vaccine under cGMPs, submitted an investigational new drug application (IND) to the FDA, received clearance from the FDA to proceed to clinical trials, and initiated the first Phase 1 clinical trial to assess safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of SANARIA PfSPZ Vaccine in May 2009. The PfSPZ vaccine is comprised of Pf sporozoites extracted from infected mosquitoes and a short term challenge for Sanaria involves the optimization of this extraction step in its manufacturing process. Currently, human operators manually carry out the critical task of isolating the sporozoites by serially dissecting salivary glands from individual mosquitoes. Sanaria has established this procedure as a reliable, reproducible, consistent, and efficient process. In the next phase of development, as we optimize the efficiency and expand the scale of vaccine manufacturing, automation of mosquito dissection will prove to be beneficial on several fronts. It will enable us to cut the costs of supporting a large taskforce of skilled technicians, the time taken to train and qualify them and the dedicated space necessary for a scaled-up manual operation. Therefore in this SBIR proposal, we focus on successfully developing strategies to mechanize the process of dissection and collection of mosquito salivary glands. In collaboration with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University we propose to develop novel instrumentation and innovative technologies to meet this goal. These will be addressed in three specific aims in which we will develop procedures that will allow batch processing of mosquitoes to isolate intact salivary glands with minimal manual involvement. This will be achieved using mechanical engineering and physical chemistry principles. First, in specific aim 1 we will create ordered arrays of mosquitoes and in specific aim 2 we will develop methods to decapitate mosquitoes and to extract and collect the salivary glands without losing sporozoites. The technology described here is expected to achieve very high throughput and process scalability. In specific aim 3 we propose a direct substitution of our current dissection configuration with robotic arms and vision guided microscope systems. This serial processing approach will circumvent the need to create mosquito assemblies and involves limited, if any, manual operation. The end-product from the advanced automated techniques however must match or exceed Sanaria's current standards for vaccine yield and potency and will drive the decision to translate our current method of mosquito salivary gland dissection to an automated platform.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria causes >300 million clinical cases and 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel. Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize a >90% protective malaria vaccine for three primary markets with a potential for >$1 billion annual revenues: 1) Travelers from the developed world to malaria endemic areas. 2) Infants and young children in the developing world. 3) Adolescent girls in the developing world. Success in this Phase I SBIR will lead to a significant increase in the efficiency of manufacture of the PfSPZ Vaccine that will facilitate scale-up of manufacturing and significantly reduce the cost of goods.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Malaria causes >300 million clinical cases and 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel.

"Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Bioconductor project provides an open resource for the development and distribution of innovative reliable software for computational biology and bioinformatics. The range of available software is broad and rapidly growing as are both the user community and the developer community. The project maintains a web portal for delivering software and documentation to end users as well as an active mailing list. Additional services for developers include a software archive, mailing list and assistance and advice program development and design      We propose an active development strategy designed to meet new challenges while simultaneously providing user and developer support for existing tools and methods. In particular we emphasize a design strategy that accommodates the imperfect, yet evolving nature of biological knowledge and the relatively rapid development of new experimental technologies. Software solutions must be able to rapidly adapt and to facilitate new problems when they arise.      CRITQUE 1:      The Bioconductor project began in 2001. In 2002 it was awarded a BISTI grant for three years 2003-2006). During this time the project has expanded and provided support for a world wide community of researchers. This is a proposal for continued development for Bioconductor, which is a set of statistical programs which are specifically tailored to the computatational biology community. Bioconductor is composed of over 130 R packages that have been contributed by a large number of developers. The software packages range from state of the art statistical methods which typically are used in microarray analysis, to annotation tools, to plotting functions, GUIs, to sequence alignment and data management packages. Contributions to and usage of Bioconductor is growing rapidly and the applicants are requesting support to continue its development as well as general logistical support for software distribution and quality assurance. The proposal includes a research component for Bioconductor which will involve the development of analysis techniques. This will include optimization of the R statistical analyses, statistical processing of Affymetrix data, analysis of SNP data, improved standards, data storage, retreivals from NCBI, sequence management, machine learning, web services and distributed computing.      SCIENTIFIC MERIT   The applicants address many issues that are crucial to the success of a large open source project with multiple contributors. Examples of training, scientific publication, documentation and resource development run throughout the proposal. Many tangible examples were given on the usage of the system by the scientific community.        EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN   This is a description of their management workflow for the project which does a good job of demonstrating the technical excellence brought to the project by this group. 1) Build annotation packages every three months, Integrate changes in annotation source data structure into annotation package building code. 2) Maintain project website, mailing lists, source control archive. Organize web resources for short course and conferences. 3) Improve existing software. 4) Sustain automated nightly builds. Work with developers whose packages fail to pass QA. 5) Resolve cross-platform issues. 6) Review new submissions. Answer questions on the mailing lists. 7) Use software engineering best practices. Develop unit testing strategies. Design appropriate classes and methods for new data types. Refactor existing code for better interoperability and extensibility. 8) Develop and organize training materials and documentation.      Extensive detail on testing, build procedures, interoperability, quality assurance and project management is given elsewhere in the document. They clearly have dealt with many issues necessary for a project of this size. They state that one of the biggest cost items is support of this package to run on multiple platforms. They point out that many contributors focus on a single platform, much of their work is track down cross-platform bugs. This is time well-spent, given the platforms used are in sync with the needs of the greater bioinformatics community.        ORIGINALITY   While a high degree of originality is not a particularly critical element of open source software development project, there are certainly areas in the proposal that are unique. Most importantly, it is safe to say that there is not another project which has this blend of statistical analysis systems specifically tailored to a important research bioinformatics area that can be deployed on a number of different computer environments.      INVESTIGATOR AND CO-INVESTIGATORS   Dr. Gentleman is the founder and leader of the Bioconductor project. Dr. Gentlemen was an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health and Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute. In 2004 he became Program Head, Computational Biology, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He has on the order of ten publications relating to Bioconductor or related statistical analysis. He implemented the original versions of the R programming language jointly with another co-founder. He is PI or Investigator of a number of research grants, at least two are directly related to this work. He and other members of the proposal have taught a number of courses and given lectures on Bioconductor, the amount of these courses certainly indicate significant dedication to the project.  A review of the PI and Co-PI activities related to this project are shown on Table 3 on page 42 of the application. The roles and time allocations assigned to each participant appear to be reasonable.  Dr. Gentleman will serve as project leader and will manage the programmers, coordinating the project, and investigating new computational methods and approaches.  Dr. Vincent Carey, as co Principal Investigator has 20% time allocated for the project.  In 2005 he became Associate Professor of Medicine (Biostatistics). Carey is a senior member of the Bioconductor development core. He will improve interoperability to allow Bioconductor reuse of external modules in Java, Perl and other languages as well as strengthen interfaces between high throughput experimental workflows and machine learning tools, and ontology capture.  An administrative assistant will assist Dr. Carey with administrative requirements, including call coordination, manuscript preparation and distribution, scheduling and budget management.  Dr. Rafael Irizarry as co-PI will spend 30% effort on the project.  Dr. Irizarry has four years experience developing methods for microarray data analysis and in the Department of Biostatistics serving as faculty liaison to the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution's Microarray Core.  He will supervize all efforts to support preprocessing on all platforms and support for microarray related consortiums such as the ERCC, GEO, and ArrayExpress.      Programmers will be responsible for the project website, managing email lists, maintaining training materials, upgrading software, refactoring and other code enhancements, managing the svn archive, and Bioconductor releases. They will handle checking all submitted packages, developing unit tests, and simplifying downloads, nightly build procedures, cross-platform issues, data technologies as well as integrating resources found in other languages (e.g. large C libraries of routines for string handling, machine learning and so on). Programmers have familiarity with R packages and systems for database management and for parallel and distributed computing. They will be responsible for managing the annotation data including package building and liaising with organism specific and other data providers.      SIGNIFICANCE   Given the scope of the proposal, and the size of the Bioconductor project in general the request for the above resources is appropriate. There is an excellent mix of grounded project management along with development of newer state of the art techniques that will benifit many members of the bioinformatics community. There is a high probability that funding this project will help to maintain and advance this important community resource.      ENVIRONMENT   The computer infrastructure, and the local departments of the PI and Co-PIs, as well as the work with the larger scientific community are all excellent environments to support this project.      IN SUMMARY   This is a terrific resource.  It is a well managed large open source project with very well crafted QA testing, documentation and training.  Continuation of this is a three year project. Beyond that period, a statement of long term stated goals is needed. The PI should articulate the strategic goals, as well as their research motivation and translate that into an action plan. They should also use that context to describe how they would go about choosing packages that are put into the Bioconductor system; Table 3 only listed the names of the packages made by the applicants, it could have gone further to give the reader more information for choosing packages.  A simple example would have been if they stated in the document: ""Given our assessment of the microarray state of the art, we ultimately aim to overlay annotation data, ontological information, and other forms of meta data onto a statistical framework for expression data."" The resulting research plan would then justify a five year project, but it was not strong enough in this application.       It should be noted that many of the benificiaries to this system are not just users that download the system.  In many cases a centralized informatics service downloads their system and then performs analysis for other members of the campus or the wider www community. While that type of ""success measure"" is hard to assess, more effort in this area in subsequent proposals would be helpful.           n/a",Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics,7910730,P41HG004059,[' '],NHGRI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,P41,2010,1093220,-0.015014428522375289
"Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Classification methods applied to microarray data have largely been those developed by the machine learning community, since the large p (number of covariates) problem is inherent in high-throughput genomic experiments. The random forest (RF) methodology has been demonstrated to be competitive with other machine learning approaches (e.g., neural networks and support vector machines). Apart from improved accuracy, a clear advantage of the RF method in comparison to most machine learning approaches is that variable importance measures are provided by the algorithm. Therefore, one can assess the relative importance each gene has on the predictive model. In a large number of applications, the class to be predicted may be inherently ordinal. Examples of ordinal responses include TNM stage (I,II,III, IV); drug toxicity (none, mild, moderate, severe); or response to treatment classified as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. These responses are ordinal; while there is an inherent ordering among the responses, there is no known underlying numerical relationship between them. While one can apply standard nominal response methods to ordinal response data, in so doing one loses the ordered information inherent in the data. Since ordinal classification methods have been largely neglected in the machine learning literature, the specific aims of this proposal are to (1) extend the recursive partitioning and RF methodologies for predicting an ordinal response by developing computational tools for the R programming environment; (2) evaluate the proposed ordinal classification methods against alternative methods using simulated, benchmark, and gene expression datasets; (3) develop and evaluate methods for assessing variable importance when interest is in predicting an ordinal response. Novel splitting criteria for classification tree growing and methods for estimating variable importance are proposed, which appropriately take the nature of the ordinal response into consideration. In addition, the Generalized Gini index and ordered twoing methods will be studied under the ensemble learning framework, which has not been previously conducted. This project is significant to the scientific community since the ordinal classification methods to be made available from this project will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect responses on an ordinal scale.           n/a",Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response,7670456,R03LM009347,"['Algorithms', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Drug toxicity', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Image Analysis', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Northern Blotting', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Relative (related person)', 'Simulate', 'Stable Disease', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Trees', 'computerized tools', 'forest', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'neglect', 'novel', 'partial response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tumor']",NLM,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R03,2009,74750,-0.013006647967483902
"Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The work proposed in this new investigator initiated project studies the hypothesis that machine learning-based text classification techniques can add significant efficiencies to the process of updating systematic reviews (SRs). Because new information constantly becomes available, medicine is constantly changing, and SRs must undergo periodic updates in order to correctly represent the best available medical knowledge at a given time.       To support studying this hypothesis, the work proposed here will undertake four specific aims:   1. Refinement and further development of text classification algorithms optimized for use in classifying   literature for the update of systematic reviews on a variety of therapeutic domains. Comparative analysis using several different machine learning techniques and strategies will be studied, as well as various means of representing the journal articles as feature vectors input to the process.   2. Identification and evaluation of systematic review expert preferences and trade offs between high recall and high precision classification systems. There are several opportunities for including this technology in the process of creating SRs. Each of these applications has separate and unique precision and recall tradeoff thresholds that will be studied based on the benefit to systematic reviews.   3. Prospective evaluation of text classification algorithms. We will verify that our approach performs as   expected on future data.   4. Development of comprehensive gold standard test and training sets to motivate and evaluate the   proposed and future work in this area.      The long term relevance of this research to public health is that automated document classification will   enable more efficient use of expert resources to create systematic reviews. This will increase both the   number and quality of reviews for a given level of public support. Since up-to-date systematic reviews are essential for establishing widespread high quality practice standards and guidelines, the overall public health will benefit from this work.          n/a",Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification,7664538,R01LM009501,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'expectation', 'journal article', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'vector']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,318898,-0.02032126200890105
"Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is submitted in response to NOT-OD-09-058 NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications. Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. Examples include scoring methods for liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, including the Knodell hepatic activity index, the Ishak score, and the METAVIR score. In addition, tumor-node-metasis stage for cancer patients is an ordinal scaled measure. Moreover, the more recently advocated method for evaluating response to treatment in target tumor lesions is the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors method, with ordinal outcomes defined as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. Traditional ordinal response modeling methods assume independence among the predictor variables and require that the number of samples (n) exceed the number of covariates (p). These are both violated in the context of high-throughput genomic studies. Our currently funded R03 grant, ""Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response,"" consists of the following three specific aims (SA.1) extend the recursive partitioning and random forest classification methodologies for predicting an ordinal response by developing computational tools for the R programming environment including implementing our ordinal impurity criteria in rpart and implementing the ordinal impurity criteria in randomForest; (SA.2) evaluate the proposed ordinal classification methods in comparison to existing nominal and continuous response methods using simulated, benchmark, and gene expression datasets; and (SA.3) develop and evaluate methods for assessing variable importance when interest is in predicting an ordinal response. Recently, penalized models have been successfully applied to high-throughput genomic datasets in fitting linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards models with excellent performance. However, extension of penalized models to the ordinal response setting has not been described. Herein we propose to extend the L1 penalized method to ordinal response models to enable modeling of common ordinal response data when a high-dimensional genomic data comprise the predictor space. This study will expand the scope of our current research by providing a model-based ordinal classification methodology applicable for high-dimensional datasets to accompany the heuristic based classification tree and random forest ordinal methodologies considered in the parent grant. The specific aims of this competitive revision application are to: Aim 1) Extend the L1 penalized methodology to enable predicting an ordinal response by developing computational tools for the R programming environment; Aim 2) Using simulated, benchmark, and gene expression datasets, evaluate L1 penalized ordinal response models by comparing error rates from our L1 fitting algorithm to those obtained when using a forward variable selection modeling strategy and our ordinal random forest approach; and Aim 3) Evaluate methods for assessing important covariates from L1 penalized ordinal response models.           This project will develop L1 penalized ordinal response models and implement them in the R programming environment. By conducting extensive comparisons of various ordinal response modeling methods using simulated, benchmark, and gene expression datasets, we will be able to make a recommendation regarding ordinal response modeling to the scientific community. This research is significant since the ordinal response modeling methods developed during the project period will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect responses on an ordinal scale.",Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response,7805045,R03LM009347,"['Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioconductor', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Drug toxicity', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health Surveys', 'Hepatic', 'Human', 'In complete remission', 'Informatics', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scoring Method', 'Simulate', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stable Disease', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Translational Research', 'Travel', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'forest', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'liver biopsy', 'meetings', 'neglect', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'partial response', 'preference', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'social', 'software development', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor']",NLM,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R03,2009,75000,-0.025175197442414067
"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software. Furthermore, computational strategies will be explored based on global optimization techniques, particularly convex programming and difference convex programming.           n/a",New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data,7651387,R01GM081535,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Outcome', 'Pan Genus', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'information classification', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2009,267801,-0.010537516222821874
"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC) proposal aims to provide a flexible analysis resource for the ENCODE project. The ENCODE project is a large multi center project which aims to define all the functional elements in the human genome. This will be achieved using many different experimental techniques coupled with numerous computational techniques. A critical part in delivering this set of functional elements is the integration of data from multiple sources. The ED AC proposal aims to provide this integration. As proscribed by the RFA for this proposal, the precise prioritization for the EDAC's work will be set by an external group, the Analysis Working Group (AWG). Based on previous experience, these analysis methods will require a variety of techniques. We expect to have to apply sophisticated statistical models to the integration of the data, in particular mitigating the problems of the extensive heterogeneity and correlation of variables on the human genome. We have statistical experts who can use the large size of the human genome, coupled with a limited number of sensible assumptions to produce statistical techniques which are robust to this considerable heterogeneity. We also expect to apply machine learning techniques to build integration methods combining datasets. These included Bayesian based inference methods and the robust computer science technique of Support Vector Machines. Each of these methods have performed well in the ENCODE pilot project and we expect them to be even more useful in the full ENCODE project. We will also provide quality assurance and summary metrics of genome-wide multiple alignments. This area has a number of complex statistical, algorithmic and engineering issues, which we will solve using state of the art techniques. Overall we aim to provide deep integration of the ENCODE data, under the direction of the AWG and in tight collaboration with the other members of the ENCODE consortium.           n/a",EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center,7622614,U01HG004695,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Be++ element', 'Behavior', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Publications', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Transcript', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'experience', 'experimental analysis', 'flexibility', 'foot', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'meetings', 'member', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'working group']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U01,2009,1224323,-0.009112614917858586
"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.) The predictions will be available through a searchable and constantly updated Web server. We will also develop a method to detect functional misannotations and apply it to all public metabolic databases. 4.) In collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. Uwe Sauer (ETH Zurich) and Dr. George Church (Harvard) we will experimentally test at least 50 of the predicted genes without close sequence homologs in E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae.           n/a",Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities,7653790,R01GM079759,"['Animal Model', 'Arts', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Church', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Orphan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Sequence Homology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'metabolomics', 'protein function', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,397297,-0.030790197264714353
"Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Metabolic pathway databases provide a biological framework in which relationships among an organism's genes may be revealed. This context can be exploited to boost the accuracy of genome annotation, to discover new targets for therapeutics, or to engineer metabolic pathways in bacteria to produce a historically expensive drug cheaply and quickly. But, knowledge of metabolism in ill-characterized species is limited and dependent on computational predictions of pathways. Our ultimate target is to develop methods for the prediction of novel metabolic pathways in any organism, coupled with robust assessment of the validity of any predicted pathway. We hypothesize that integrating evidence from multiple levels of an organism's metabolic network - from the fit of a pathway within the network to evolutionary relationships between pathways - will allow us to assess pathway validity and to predict novel metabolic pathways. We have successfully applied machine learning methods to the problem of identifying missing enzymes in metabolic pathways and believe similar methods will prove fruitful in this application. Our preliminary studies have identified several properties of predicted metabolic pathways that differ between sets of true positive pathway predictions (i.e., pathways known to occur in an organism) and sets of false positive pathway predictions. We will expand on these features and develop methods to address the following specific aims:      1) Identify features that are informative in distinguishing between correct and incorrect pathway predictions in computationally-generated pathway/genome databases based on predictions for highly-curated organisms (e.g., Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis thaliana).   2) Develop methods for computing the probability that a pathway is correctly predicted. Informative features identified in Specific Aim #1 will be integrated into a classifier that will compute the probability that a predicted pathway is correct given the associated evidence.   3) Extend the Pathologic program (the Pathway Tools algorithm used to infer the metabolic network of an organism) to predict alternate, previously unknown pathways in an organism. We will search the MetaCyc reaction space (comprising almost 6000 reactions) for novel subpathways, explicitly constraining our search using organism-specific evidence (i.e., homology, experimental evidence, etc.) at each step.          n/a",Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types,7685518,R01LM009651,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antimalarials', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia', 'Escherichia coli', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mouse-ear Cress', 'Organism', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Prodrugs', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'genome database', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pathway tools', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NLM,SRI INTERNATIONAL,R01,2009,175647,-0.010856348605739806
"The Statistical and Computational Analysis of Flow Cytometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Flow cytometry is a data-rich technology that plays a critical role in basic research and clinical therapy for a variety of human diseases.

"National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases.

"Stochastic dynamics for multiscale biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Complex biological systems are increasingly subject to investigation by mathematical modeling in general and stochastic simulation in particular. Advanced mathematical methods will be used to generate next-generation computational methods and algorithms for (1) formulating these models, (2) simulating or sampling their stochastic dynamics, (3) reducing them to simpler approximating models for use in multiscale simulation, and (4) optimizing their unknown or partly known parameters to fit observed behaviors and/or measurements. The proposed methods are based on advances in applied statistical and stochastic mathematics, including advances arising from operator algebra, quantum field theory, stochastic processes, statistical physics, machine learning, and related mathematically grounded fields. A central technique in this work will be the use of the operator algebra formulation of the chemical master equation.       The biological systems to be studied include and are representative of high-value biomedical target systems whose complexity and spatiotemporal scale requires improved mathematical and computational methods, to obtain the scientific understanding underlying future medical intervention. Cancer research is broadly engaged in signal transduction systems and complexes with feedback, for which the yeast Ste5 MARK pathway is a model system. DNA damage sensing (through ATM) and repair control (though p53 and Mdm2) are at least equally important to cancer research owing to the central role that failure of these systems play in many cancers.

"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide.

"Efficient software and algorithms for analyzing markers data on general pedigree    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to develop an efficient, extensible, modular, and accessible software toolbox that facilitates statistical methods for analyzing complex pedigrees. The toolbox will consist of novel algorithms that extend state of the art algorithms from graph theory, statistics, artificial intelligence, and genetics. This tool will enhance capabilities to analyze genetic components of inherited diseases. The specific aim of this project is to develop an extensible software system for efficiently computing pedigree likelihood for complex diseases in the presence of multiple polymorphic markers, and SNP markers, in fully general pedigrees taking into account qualitative (discrete) and quantitative traits and a variety of disease models. Our experience shows that by building on top of the insight gained within the last decade from the study of computational probability, in particular, from the theory of probabilistic networks, we can construct a software system whose functionality, speed, and extensibility is unmatched by current linkage software. We plan to integrate these new methods into an existing linkage analysis software, called superlink, which is already gaining momentum for analyzing large pedigrees. We will also continue to work with several participating genetic units in research hospitals and improve the software quality and reliability as we proceed with algorithmic improvements. In this project we will develop novel algorithms for more efficient likelihood calculations and more efficient maximization algorithms for the most general pedigrees. These algorithms will remove redundancy due to determinism, use cashing of partial results effectively, and determine close-to-optimal order of operations taking into account these enhancements. Time-space trade-offs will be computed that allow to use memory space in the most effective way, and to automatically determine on which portions of a complex pedigree exact computations are infeasible. In such cases, a combination of exact computations with intelligent use of approximation techniques, such as variational methods and sampling, will be employed. In particular we will focus on advancing sampling schemes such as MCMC used in the Morgan program and integrating it with exact computation.

"Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Bioconductor project provides an open resource for the development and distribution of innovative reliable software for computational biology and bioinformatics. The range of available software is broad and rapidly growing as are both the user community and the developer community. The project maintains a web portal for delivering software and documentation to end users as well as an active mailing list. Additional services for developers include a software archive, mailing list and assistance and advice program development and design      We propose an active development strategy designed to meet new challenges while simultaneously providing user and developer support for existing tools and methods. In particular we emphasize a design strategy that accommodates the imperfect, yet evolving nature of biological knowledge and the relatively rapid development of new experimental technologies. Software solutions must be able to rapidly adapt and to facilitate new problems when they arise.      CRITQUE 1:      The Bioconductor project began in 2001. In 2002 it was awarded a BISTI grant for three years 2003-2006). During this time the project has expanded and provided support for a world wide community of researchers. This is a proposal for continued development for Bioconductor, which is a set of statistical programs which are specifically tailored to the computatational biology community. Bioconductor is composed of over 130 R packages that have been contributed by a large number of developers. The software packages range from state of the art statistical methods which typically are used in microarray analysis, to annotation tools, to plotting functions, GUIs, to sequence alignment and data management packages. Contributions to and usage of Bioconductor is growing rapidly and the applicants are requesting support to continue its development as well as general logistical support for software distribution and quality assurance. The proposal includes a research component for Bioconductor which will involve the development of analysis techniques. This will include optimization of the R statistical analyses, statistical processing of Affymetrix data, analysis of SNP data, improved standards, data storage, retreivals from NCBI, sequence management, machine learning, web services and distributed computing.      SCIENTIFIC MERIT   The applicants address many issues that are crucial to the success of a large open source project with multiple contributors. Examples of training, scientific publication, documentation and resource development run throughout the proposal. Many tangible examples were given on the usage of the system by the scientific community.        EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN   This is a description of their management workflow for the project which does a good job of demonstrating the technical excellence brought to the project by this group. 1) Build annotation packages every three months, Integrate changes in annotation source data structure into annotation package building code. 2) Maintain project website, mailing lists, source control archive. Organize web resources for short course and conferences. 3) Improve existing software. 4) Sustain automated nightly builds. Work with developers whose packages fail to pass QA. 5) Resolve cross-platform issues. 6) Review new submissions. Answer questions on the mailing lists. 7) Use software engineering best practices. Develop unit testing strategies. Design appropriate classes and methods for new data types. Refactor existing code for better interoperability and extensibility. 8) Develop and organize training materials and documentation.      Extensive detail on testing, build procedures, interoperability, quality assurance and project management is given elsewhere in the document. They clearly have dealt with many issues necessary for a project of this size. They state that one of the biggest cost items is support of this package to run on multiple platforms. They point out that many contributors focus on a single platform, much of their work is track down cross-platform bugs. This is time well-spent, given the platforms used are in sync with the needs of the greater bioinformatics community.        ORIGINALITY   While a high degree of originality is not a particularly critical element of open source software development project, there are certainly areas in the proposal that are unique. Most importantly, it is safe to say that there is not another project which has this blend of statistical analysis systems specifically tailored to a important research bioinformatics area that can be deployed on a number of different computer environments.      INVESTIGATOR AND CO-INVESTIGATORS   Dr. Gentleman is the founder and leader of the Bioconductor project. Dr. Gentlemen was an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health and Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute. In 2004 he became Program Head, Computational Biology, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He has on the order of ten publications relating to Bioconductor or related statistical analysis. He implemented the original versions of the R programming language jointly with another co-founder. He is PI or Investigator of a number of research grants, at least two are directly related to this work. He and other members of the proposal have taught a number of courses and given lectures on Bioconductor, the amount of these courses certainly indicate significant dedication to the project.  A review of the PI and Co-PI activities related to this project are shown on Table 3 on page 42 of the application. The roles and time allocations assigned to each participant appear to be reasonable.  Dr. Gentleman will serve as project leader and will manage the programmers, coordinating the project, and investigating new computational methods and approaches.  Dr. Vincent Carey, as co Principal Investigator has 20% time allocated for the project.  In 2005 he became Associate Professor of Medicine (Biostatistics). Carey is a senior member of the Bioconductor development core. He will improve interoperability to allow Bioconductor reuse of external modules in Java, Perl and other languages as well as strengthen interfaces between high throughput experimental workflows and machine learning tools, and ontology capture.  An administrative assistant will assist Dr. Carey with administrative requirements, including call coordination, manuscript preparation and distribution, scheduling and budget management.  Dr. Rafael Irizarry as co-PI will spend 30% effort on the project.  Dr. Irizarry has four years experience developing methods for microarray data analysis and in the Department of Biostatistics serving as faculty liaison to the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution's Microarray Core.  He will supervize all efforts to support preprocessing on all platforms and support for microarray related consortiums such as the ERCC, GEO, and ArrayExpress.      Programmers will be responsible for the project website, managing email lists, maintaining training materials, upgrading software, refactoring and other code enhancements, managing the svn archive, and Bioconductor releases. They will handle checking all submitted packages, developing unit tests, and simplifying downloads, nightly build procedures, cross-platform issues, data technologies as well as integrating resources found in other languages (e.g. large C libraries of routines for string handling, machine learning and so on). Programmers have familiarity with R packages and systems for database management and for parallel and distributed computing. They will be responsible for managing the annotation data including package building and liaising with organism specific and other data providers.      SIGNIFICANCE   Given the scope of the proposal, and the size of the Bioconductor project in general the request for the above resources is appropriate. There is an excellent mix of grounded project management along with development of newer state of the art techniques that will benifit many members of the bioinformatics community. There is a high probability that funding this project will help to maintain and advance this important community resource.      ENVIRONMENT   The computer infrastructure, and the local departments of the PI and Co-PIs, as well as the work with the larger scientific community are all excellent environments to support this project.      IN SUMMARY   This is a terrific resource.  It is a well managed large open source project with very well crafted QA testing, documentation and training.  Continuation of this is a three year project. Beyond that period, a statement of long term stated goals is needed. The PI should articulate the strategic goals, as well as their research motivation and translate that into an action plan. They should also use that context to describe how they would go about choosing packages that are put into the Bioconductor system; Table 3 only listed the names of the packages made by the applicants, it could have gone further to give the reader more information for choosing packages.  A simple example would have been if they stated in the document: ""Given our assessment of the microarray state of the art, we ultimately aim to overlay annotation data, ontological information, and other forms of meta data onto a statistical framework for expression data."" The resulting research plan would then justify a five year project, but it was not strong enough in this application.       It should be noted that many of the benificiaries to this system are not just users that download the system.  In many cases a centralized informatics service downloads their system and then performs analysis for other members of the campus or the wider www community. While that type of ""success measure"" is hard to assess, more effort in this area in subsequent proposals would be helpful.           n/a",Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics,7669241,P41HG004059,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Award', 'Bioconductor', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Building Codes', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Database Management Systems', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Documentation', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Faculty', 'Familiarity', 'FarGo', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Motivation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Participant', 'Policies', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Programming Languages', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Reader', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Services', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'cluster computing', 'computer infrastructure', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'member', 'model development', 'open source', 'originality', 'professor', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'research study', 'software development', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web site', 'web-accessible']",NHGRI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,P41,2009,829379,-0.015014428522375289

"Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent and continuing technological advances are producing large amounts of disparate data about cell structure, function and activity. This is driving the development of tools for storing, mining, analyzing, visualizing and integrating data. This proposal describes the VisANT system: a tool for visual data mining that operates on a local database which includes results from our lab, as well as automatically updated proteomics data from web accessible databases such as MIPS and BIND. In addition to accessing its own database, a name normalization table (i.e. a dictionary of identifiers), permits the system to seamlessly retrieve sequence, disease and other data from sources such as GenBank and OMIM. The visualization tool is able to reversibly group related sets of nodes, and display and duplicate their internal structure, providing an approach to hierarchical representation and modeling. We propose to build further on these unique features by including capabilities for mining and representing chemical reactions, orthologous networks, combinatorially regulated transcriptional networks, splice variants and functional hierarchies. Software is open source, and the system also allows users to exchange and integrate the networks that they discover with those of others.           n/a","Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis",7663288,R01RR022971,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Genbank', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Information Systems', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Technology', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'data mining', 'improved', 'meetings', 'models and simulation', 'open source', 'outreach', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web-accessible', 'wiki']",NCRR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2009,437938,-0.0067238657438045985
"Optimal Micro-Data Switching: An Enhanced Framework and Decision Tool for Confid    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is the development of an innovative technique to avoid disclosure of confidential data in public use tabular data. Our proposed technique, called Optimal Data Switching (OS), overcomes the limitations and disadvantages found in currently deployed disclosure limitation methods. Statistical databases for public use pose a critical problem of identifying how to make the data available for analysis without disclosing information that would infringe on privacy, violate confidentiality, or endanger national security. Organizations in both the public and private sectors have a major stake in this confidentiality protection problem, given the fact that access to data is essential for advancing research and formulating policy. Yet, the possibility of extracting certain sensitive elements of information from the data can jeopardize the welfare of these organizations and potentially, in some instances, the welfare of the society in which they operate. The challenge is, therefore, to represent the data in a form that permits accurate analysis for supporting research, decision-making and policy initiatives, while preventing an unscrupulous or ill-intentioned party from exploiting the data for harmful consequences. Our goal is to build on the latest advances in optimization, to which the OptTek Systems, Inc. (OptTek) research team has made pioneering contributions, to provide a framework based on optimal data switching, enabling the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other organizations to effectively meet the challenge of confidentiality protection. The framework we propose is structured to be easy to use in a wide array of application settings and diverse user environments, from client-server to web-based, regardless of whether the micro-data is continuous, ordinal, binary, or any combination of these types. The successful development of such a framework, and the computer-based method for implementing it, is badly needed and will be of value to many types of organizations, not only in the public sector but also in the private sector, for whom the incentive to publish data is both economic as well as scientific. Examples in the public sector are evident, where organizations like CDC and the U.S. Census Bureau exist for the purpose of collecting, analyzing and publishing data for analysis by other parties. Numerous examples are also encountered in the private sector, notably in banking and financial services, healthcare (including drug companies and medical research institutions), market research, oil exploration, computational biology, renewable and sustainable energy, retail sales, product development, and a wide variety of other areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the process of accumulating and disseminating public health data for reporting purposes, various uses, and statistical analysis, we must guarantee that individual records describing each person or establishment are protected. Organizations in both the public and private sectors have a major stake in this confidentiality protection problem, given the fact that access to data is essential for advancing research and formulating policy. This project proposes the development of a robust methodology and practical framework to deliver an efficient and effective tool to protect the confidentiality in published tabular data.                      n/a",Optimal Micro-Data Switching: An Enhanced Framework and Decision Tool for Confid,7790821,R43MH086138,"['Accounting', 'American', 'Area', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Client', 'Computational Biology', 'Confidentiality', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disclosure', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Institution', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Security', 'Oils', 'Online Systems', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Policy Making', 'Privacy', 'Private Sector', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Support', 'Respondent', 'Sales', 'Services', 'Social Welfare', 'Societies', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'prevent', 'product development', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIMH,"OPTTEK SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2009,4047,-0.00036773140750709116
"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          n/a",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,7693803,R01LM009719,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Human Genome Project', 'Improve Access', 'International', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Writing', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'repository', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,280000,-0.022080245470145147
"Integrated Analysis of Genome-Wide Array Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an integrated desktop application to combine data from expression array, RNA transcript array, proteomics, SNP array (for polymorphism an analysis, as well as LOH and copy number determination), methylation array, histone modification array, promoter array, and microRNA array and metabolomics technologies. Current approaches to analysis of individual `omic' technologies suffer from problems of fragmentation, that present an incomplete view of the workings of the cell. However, effective integration into a single analytic platform is non-trivial. There is a need for a consistent approach, infrastructure, and interface between array types, to maximize ease of use, while recognizing and accommodating the specific computational and statistical requirements, and biological context, of each array. A central challenge is the need to create and work with lists of genomic regions of interest (GROIs) for each sample: we propose three novel approaches to aid in identification of GROIs. These lists must then be integrated with rectangular (sample by feature) data arrays to facilitate statistical analysis. Integration between array types occurs at the computational level, through a unified software package, statistically, through tools that seek statistical relationships between features from different arrays, biologically, through use of annotations (particularly gene ontology, protein- protein and protein-DNA interactions, and pathway membership) that document functional relationships between features, and through genomic interactions that suggest relationships between features that map to the same regions of the genome. The end product will support analysis of each platform separately, with a comprehensive suite of data management, statistical and heuristic analytic tools and the means to place findings of interest into a meaningful biological context through cross-reference to extensive biobases. Beyond that, a range of methods - statistical, biological and genomic - will be available to explore interactions and associations between platforms.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While the large-scale array technologies have provided an unprecedented capability to model cellular processes, both in normal functioning and disease states, this capability is utterly dependent on the availability of complex data management, computational, statistical and informatic software tools.  The utility of the next generation of arrays - which focus on critical regulation and control functions of the cell - will be stymied by an initial lack of suitable bioinformatic tools.  This proposal initiates an accelerated development of an integrated software package intended to empower biologists in the application and analysis of these powerful new technologies, with broadly reaching impact at all levels of biological and clinical research, and across every discipline.          n/a",Integrated Analysis of Genome-Wide Array Data,7788875,R43HG004677,"['Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bite', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA copy number', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heating', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Transcript', 'Work', 'base', 'data management', 'empowered', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'heuristics', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'interest', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,EPICENTER SOFTWARE,R43,2009,142123,-0.03467175024411744
"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently a gap exists between the explosion of high-throughput data generation in molecular biology and the relatively slower growth of reliable functional information extracted from the data. This gap is largely due to the lack of specificity necessary for accurate gene function prediction in the currently available large-scale experimental technologies for rapid protein function assessment. Bioinformatics methods that integrate diverse data sources in their analysis achieve higher accuracy and thus alleviate this lack of specificity, but there's a paucity of generalizable, efficient, and accurate methods for data integration. In addition, no efficient methods exist to effectively display diverse genomic data, even though visualization has been very valuable for analysis of data from large scale technologies such as gene expression microarrays. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop an accurate and generalizable bioinformatics framework for integrated analysis and visualization of heterogeneous biological data.      We propose to address the data integration problem with a Bayesian network approach and effective visualization methods. We have shown the efficacy of this method in a proof-of-principle system that increased the accuracy of gene function prediction for Saccharomyces cerevisiae compared to individual data sources. Building on our previous work, we present a two-part plan to improve and expand our system and to develop novel visualization methods for genomic data based on the scalable display technology. First, we will investigate the computational and theoretical issues behind accurate integration, analysis and effective visualization of heterogeneous high-throughput data. Then, leveraging our existing system and algorithmic improvements developed in the first part of the project, we will design and implement a full-scale data integration and function prediction system for Saccharomyces cerevisiae that will be incorporated with the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), a model organism database for yeast.      The proposed system would provide highly accurate automatic function prediction that can accelerate genomic functional annotation through targeted experimental testing. Furthermore, our system will perform general integration and will offer researchers a unified view of the diverse high-throughput data through effective integration and visualization tools, thereby facilitating hypothesis generation and data analysis. Our scalable visualization methods will enable teams of researchers to examine biological data interactively and thus support the highly collaborative nature of genomic research. In addition to contributing to S. cerevisiae genomics, the technology for efficient and accurate heterogeneous data integration and visualization developed as a result of this proposal will form a basis for systems that address the same set of issues for other organisms, including the human. n/a",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,7595813,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Explosion', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteomics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Saccharomyces', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data integration', 'design', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome database', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'parallel computing', 'programs', 'protein function', 'prototype', 'research study', 'software development', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'ultra high resolution', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,243004,-0.012007764559782062
"National Alliance-Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC)(RMI) The National Alliance for Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC) is a multiinstitutional, interdisciplinary team of  computer scientists, software engineers, and medical investigators who develop computational tools for the  analysis and visualization of medical image data. The purpose of the center is to provide the infrastructure  and environment for the development of computational algorithms and open source technologies, and then  oversee the training and dissemination of these tools to the medical research community. This world-class  software and development environment serves as a foundation for accelerating the development and  deployment of computational tools that are readily accessible to the medical research community. The team  combines cutting-edge computer vision research (to create medical imaging analysis algorithms) with state  of the art software engineering techniques (based on ""extreme"" programming techniques in a distributed,  open-source environment) to enable computational examination of both basic neurosience and neurologicat  disorders. In developing this infrastructure resource, the team will significantly expand upon proven open  systems technology and platforms. The driving biological projects will come initially from the study of  schizophrenia, but the methods will be applicable to many other diseases. The computational tools and open  systems technologies and platforms developed by NAMIC will initially be used to study anatomical structures  and connectivity patterns in the brain, derangements of which have long been thought to play a role in the  etiology of schizophrenia. The overall analysis will occur at a range of scales, and will occur across a range  of modalities including diffusion MRI, quantitative EGG, and metabolic and receptor PET, but potentially  including microscopic, genomic, and other image data. It will apply to image data from individual  )atients,and to studies executed across large poplulations.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials.

"A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A Fully Automatic System For Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis SUMMARY The requirement for a trained user to interact with tissue and images is a long-standing impediment to higher throughput analysis of biological microstructures using unbiased stereology, the state-of-the-art method for accurate quantification of biological structure. Phase 1 studies addressed this limitation with Verified Computerized Stereoanalysis (VCS), an innovative approach for automatic stereological analysis that improves throughput efficiency by 6-9 fold compared to conventional computerized stereology. Work in Phase 2 integrated VCS into the Stereologer"", an integrated hardware-software-microscopy system for stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images. Validation studies of first-order stereological parameters. i.e., volume, surface area, length, number, confirmed that the color-based detection methods in the VCS approach achieve accurate results for automatic stereological analysis of high S:N biological microstructures. These studies indicate that fully automatic stereological analysis of tissue sections and stored images can be realized by elimination of two remaining barriers, which will be addressed in this Phase II Continuation Competing Renewal. In Aim 1, applications for feature extraction and microstructure classification, developed in part with funding from the Office of Naval Research, will be integrated into the VCS program. The new application (VCS II) will use these approaches to automatically detect and classify polymorphic microstructures of biological interest using a range of feature calculations, including size, color, border, shape, and texture, with support from active learning and Support Vector Machines. Work in Aim 2 will eliminate physical handling of glass slides during computerized stereology studies by equipping the Stereologer system with automatic slide loading/unloading technology controlled by the Stereologer system. This technology will approximately double the throughput efficiency of the current VCS program and support ""human-in-the-loop"" interaction for sample microstructures on the border between two or more adjacent classes. The studies in Aim 3 will rigorously test the hypothesis that fully automatic VCS can quantify first- and second-order stereological parameters, without a loss of accuracy compared to the current gold-standard - non-automatic computerized stereology, e.g., manual Stereologer. If these studies validate the accuracy of VCS II, then commercialization of the fully automatic program will facilitate the throughout efficiency for testing scientific hypotheses in a wide variety of biomedical research projects; reduce labor costs for computerized stereology studies; hasten the growth of our understanding of biological processes that underlie health, longevity, and disease; and accelerate the development of novel approaches for the therapeutic management of human disease. Solid evidence that the SRC and its strategic partners can effectively commercialize this technology is demonstrated by their worldwide sales and support of the Stereologer system for the past 13 years.

"Detection of Drug Effects in Small Groups Using PET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop optimized image analysis pipelines for pharmaceutical evaluation based on functional neuroimaging, in particular based on positron emission tomography (PET). Strength of drug effect will be assessed using statistical measures of detection power, reproducibility of spatial activation patterns, and regional power estimates. Spatial parametric images will be computed for each of the prediction models investigated. A wide range of predictive models, including many that are new to the functional neuroimaging field, will be implemented and evaluated within a sophisticated statistical resampling framework. A grid-aware software package will be developed based on the results obtained. This software is intended to be run in-house in a distributed computing environment at Predictek to provide state-of-the-art optimized image analysis services to its customers. A scaled-down user-friendly Java implementation of some of the best- performing methods (based on evaluations performed in the project) will also be developed for distribution to end users wishing to perform advanced analyses themselves.

"Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs) are a group of structurally diverse compounds that include pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants.  They can elicit a number of adverse health effects such as hormone dependent cancers, reproductive tract abnormalities, compromised reproductive fitness, and impaired cognitive abilities.  In order to fully assess the potential adverse effects of synthetic and natural EEDs, a more comprehensive understanding of their molecular, metabolic, and tissue level effects is required within the context of a whole organism.  This collaborative proposal will elucidate the pathways, networks and signaling cascades perturbed by EEDs using the complementary multidisciplinary expertise of its team members in the areas of toxicology, molecular biology, endocrinology, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, data management and advanced data analysis.  The comparative effects of ethynyl estradiol (EE), genistein (GEN), and o, p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) on metabolite levels will be assessed in urine, serum and liver extracts by multinuclear (i. e., 1H, 13C, 31P) NMR spectroscopy, and complemented with histopathology examination and gene expression data from ongoing microarray studies in both mouse and rat models.  All data will be stored and archived in dbZach, a MIAME-compliant toxicogenomic supportive database that facilitates data analysis, the integration of disparate data sets, the exchange of data between investigators, and the deposition of data into public repositories.  Advanced statistical approaches, modeling and data integration tools such as neural networks, data fusion, and Baysean inference will be used to fuse these disparate data sets in order to elucidate the conserved biological networks that are of importance in response to endogenous estrogens.  Moreover, EED perturbed pathways associated with elicited effects will be further defined.  Results from these studies will not only further define the physiologic and toxic mechanisms of action of estrogenic compounds but will also demonstrate the synergy of fusing complementary microarray, metabolomic and histopathology data into a comprehensive integrative computational model.  This approach will also demonstrate the ability to maximize knowledge extraction from all disparate data available within the proposed innovative data management system when used with the advanced information tools that will be developed.            n/a",Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor,7625039,R01ES013927,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Base Management', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endocrinology', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genistein', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Histopathology', 'Hormones', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver Extract', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Multinuclear NMR', 'Mus', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ Weight', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Whole Organism', 'aqueous', 'comparative', 'data exchange', 'data format', 'data integration', 'data management', 'dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane', 'dietary supplements', 'estrogenic endocrine disruptor', 'experience', 'fitness', 'innovation', 'member', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'tool']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,536571,-0.019127938120422926
"Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this three-year project, we aim to apply state-of-the-art information analysis technologies to assist the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that are increasingly being used as a foundation for evidence-based medicine (EBM) and comparative effectiveness reviews. We plan to develop a human guided computerized abstract screening tool to greatly reduce the need to perform a tedious but crucial step of manually screening many thousands of abstracts generated by literature searches in order to retrieve a small fraction potentially relevant for further analysis. This tool will combine proven machine learning techniques with a new open source tool that enables management of the screening process. This new technology will enable investigators to screen abstracts in a small fraction of the time compared to the current manual process. It will reduce the time and cost of producing systematic reviews, provide clear documentation of the process and potentially perform the task more accurately. With the acceptance of EBM and increasing demands for systematic reviews, there is a great need for tools to assist in generating new systematic reviews and in updating them. This need cannot be more pressing. The recent passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the $1.1 billion allocated for comparative effectiveness research have created an unprecedented need for systematic reviews and opportunities to improve the methodologies and efficiency of their conduct.   We herein propose the development of novel, open-source software to help systematic reviewers better   cope with these torrents of data. The research and development of this tool will be carried out by a highly experienced team of systematic review investigators with computer scientists at Tufts University who began to collaborate last year as a result of Tufts being awarded one of the NIH Clinical Translational Science Awards (CTSA). We will pursue dissemination of the new technology through numerous channels including, but not limited to publication, presentation at conferences, exploring interest in its adoption by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) Program, Cochrane Collaboration, CTSA network, and other groups conducting systematic reviews, and production of tutorial material. Our aims are:   1. Conduct research to design and implement a semi-automated system using machine learning and   information retrieval methods to identify relevant abstracts in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of systematic reviews.   2. Develop Abstrackr, an open-source system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for screening abstracts, that applies the methods developed in Aim 1 to automatically exclude irrelevant abstracts/articles.   3. Evaluate the performance of the active learning model developed in Aim 1 and the functionality of   Abstrackr developed in Aim 2 through application to a collection of manually screened datasets of   biomedical abstracts that will subsequently be made publicly available for use as a repository to spur   research in the machine learning and information retrieval communities.           Systematic reviewing is a scientific approach to objectively summarizing the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments for diseases, a prerequisite for informed healthcare decision-making. Systematic reviewers must read many thousands of medical study abstracts, the vast majority of which are completely irrelevant to the review at hand. This is hugely laborious and time consuming. We propose to build a computerized system that automatically excludes a large number of the irrelevant abstracts, thereby accelerating the process and expediting the application of the systematic review findings to patient care.",Semi-Automated Abstract Screening for Comparative Effectiveness Reviews,7786337,R01HS018494,[' '],AHRQ,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2009,362692,-0.004364798521262574
"Gene Ontology Consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our objective is to provide the scientific community with a consistent, robust information environment for describing, sharing, integrating and comparing the functional roles of genes, proteins and functional RNAs within and across all organisms. The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium is an international collaboration of model organism database and genome annotation groups who have joined together to establish standards for describing genomes and gene products and to provide tools and support for the consistent application of these standards for functional annotations that facilitate and enable biological research. The GO provides specific classifications including well-defined, biologically descriptive terms that are organized into specialization and part-of hierarchies for the domains of genome feature, molecular function, biological process and cellular component. The GO classifications are independent of any particular technology, an uncoupling of terminology from technology that encourages application of these semantic standards by organism annotation groups that utilize a wide range of technical environments. The GO has been widely adopted and used for representation of complex biological information for model organism genomes, and is increasingly used for the functional annotation of emerging genomes. With the increased use of the GO, the Consortium must actively work to ensure both the accuracy of the ontologies as well as consistency and quality of annotations so that these resources may be reliably used to draw inferences and make biological predictions.

"Gene Ontology Consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our objective is to provide the scientific community with a consistent, robust information environment for describing, sharing, integrating and comparing the functional roles of genes, proteins and functional RNAs within and across all organisms. The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium is an international collaboration of model organism database and genome annotation groups who have joined together to establish standards for describing genomes and gene products and to provide tools and support for the consistent application of these standards for functional annotations that facilitate and enable biological research. The GO provides specific classifications including well-defined, biologically descriptive terms that are organized into specialization and part-of hierarchies for the domains of genome feature, molecular function, biological process and cellular component. The GO classifications are independent of any particular technology, an uncoupling of terminology from technology that encourages application of these semantic standards by organism annotation groups that utilize a wide range of technical environments. The GO has been widely adopted and used for representation of complex biological information for model organism genomes, and is increasingly used for the functional annotation of emerging genomes. With the increased use of the GO, the Consortium must actively work to ensure both the accuracy of the ontologies as well as consistency and quality of annotations so that these resources may be reliably used to draw inferences and make biological predictions. We will do so by focusing on four key aims: 1) We will maintain logically rigorous and biologically precise ontologies; 2) We will ensure comprehensive annotation of reference genomes, including human, using the GO; 3) We will support GO annotation efforts for emerging genomes and for those specialized sets of genes and proteins of particular community interest; and 4) We will provide annotations and tools to the research community thus supporting experimental biologists, genome informaticists, and computational biologists who are using GO annotations in their research particularly in the areas of functional genomics and comparative biology.

"A Resource for Biomedical Ontologies and Knowledge Bases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       For more than two decades, our laboratory has been studying technology to develop, manage, and use formal descriptions of biomedical concepts. The result of this work is Protege, a workbench that allows users to edit and apply controlled terminologies, ontologies, and knowledge bases to a wide range of information-management problems. To date, more than 50,000 people have registered as users of the system. Many diverse projects in biomedicine-supported by nearly every institute and center at NIH-have become critically dependent on this software and the knowledge-engineering principles that it supports. This P41 competing renewal application seeks to continue support for Protege, as a biomedical informatics resource that will benefit the system's entire user community.      We propose technology research and development to expand the capabilities of the Protege system to meet the current and anticipated needs of the user community. We will re-engineer Protege with a service-oriented architecture that can adapt to the requirements of new ontology languages, large ontology repositories, and cutting-edge ontology-management-services, such as reasoning, alignment, and evolution. We will create support for collaborative ontology development, in the context of both large, centralized projects and open, decentralized efforts. We also will develop advanced support for using ontologies in application software development and as integral parts of software systems.      As a biomedical informatics resource, we will expand our collaborative research projects with other Prot¿g¿ users. We will provide service to the Protege user community through enhanced technical support, user documentation, tutorials, and workshops.

"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies. We plan to extend the Protigi ontology editor-the most widely used ontology editor today, with almost 100,000 registered users-to support collaborative development of ontologies and to evaluate the new tools by deploying them at the World Health Organization for the development of ICD-11 and in other settings.             n/a",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,7565504,R01GM086587,"['Adopted', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Outsourcing', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Published Comment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forging', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,529858,-0.01700930584690811
"National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions.         n/a",National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI),7676864,U54CA121852,[' '],NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2009,3464579,-0.01165943131229927
"HealthMap: Knowledge Management for Emerging Infectious Disease Intelligence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Even as many developed countries strengthen their traditional clinically-based surveillance capacity, a basic level of health information infrastructure is still lacking in many parts of the developing world, including areas that are most vulnerable to emerging health threats. To help fill this gap, electronic news outlets, disease reporting networks, discussion sites, and blogs are proving to be invaluable data sources for a new generation of public health surveillance systems that operate across international borders- almost all major outbreaks investigated by WHO, including SARS, are first identified by these informal online sources. These data sources provide local and timely information about disease outbreaks and related events around the world, including areas relatively invisible to day-to-day global public health efforts due to lack of infrastructure or political suppression of information. However, since this information is dispersed and largely unstructured, there is lack of organization and integration between sources, precluding a global view of all ongoing disease threats. In order to construct such an integrated view of current emerging infections, we deployed an early prototype called Health Map, a freely available multi-stream real-time knowledge management system that aggregates and maps health alerts across numerous key data sources, including WHO alerts, newswires, mailing lists. Leveraging our previous National Library of Medicine funded work in real-time health monitoring; we propose extensive development of this new digital resource to address technological and methodological barriers to achieving a synthesized, comprehensive, and customized view of global health. The principal objective of Health Map development is to provide access to the greatest amount of possibly useful information across the widest variety of geographical areas and disease agents, without overwhelming the user with an excess of information, or obscuring important and urgent elements. We will specifically address the challenge of providing structure to unstructured data while still enabling the astute user to notice the subtle pattern that could be an early indication of a significant outbreak. Development of Health Map will proceed along the four key components of surveillance: (1) data acquisition (evaluation and integration of multiple electronic sources) (2) information characterization (disease and location categorization and severity rating of unstructured data), (3) signal interpretation (multi-stream signal detection, spatiotemporal modeling and risk assessment) and (4) knowledge dissemination (tiered dissemination of global infectious disease alerts and flexible data visualization tools). In each area, we will make critical enhancements to the existing prototype. We plan rigorous evaluation to ensure that Health Map successfully leverages electronic sources for surveillance, communication, and intervention. We will also conduct comprehensive user testing, usability studies, user behavior analysis as part of our effort. Our goal is to make Health Map a vital knowledge resource tailored for both the general public and public health decision-makers.        Although an enormous amount of information about current infectious disease outbreaks is found in Web- accessible information sources, this information is dispersed and not well-organized, making it almost impossible for public health officials and concerned citizens to know about all ongoing emerging disease threats.

"DEVELOPMENT OF DATA ONTOLOGIES FOR INTEGRATING MULTI-CENTER CARDIOVASCULAR STUDIE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia constitute a major public-health burden due to increased mortality and morbidity and rising health care costs. Massive epidemiological data are needed to detect the small effects of many individual genes and the environment on these traits. However, sample sizes needed to make powerful inferences may only be reached by integrating multiple epidemiological studies. Meaningful integration of information from multiple studies requires the development of data ontologies which make it possible to integrate information across studies in an optimum manner so as to maximize the information content and hence the statistical power for detecting small effect sizes. A second compounding problem of data integration is that software applications that manage such study data are typically non-interoperable, i.e. “silos” of data, and are incapable of being shared in a syntactically and semantically meaningful manner. Consequently, an infrastructure that integrates across studies in an interoperable manner is needed to ensure that epidemiological cardiovascular research remains a viable and major player in the biomedical informatics revolution which is currently underway. The cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIGTM) is addressing these problems in the cancer domain by developing software systems that are able to exchange information or that are syntactically interoperable by accessing metadata that is semantically annotated using controlled vocabularies. Our overarching goal is to develop ontologies for integrating cardiovascular epidemiological data from multiple studies. Specifically, we propose three Aims: First, develop cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies for each of three disparate multi-center epidemiological studies that facilitate data integration across the studies and data mining for various phenotypes. Second, adopt a technology infrastructure that leverages the cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies using Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and caBIGTM tools to facilitate the integration and widespread sharing of cardiovascular data sets. Third, facilitate seamless data sharing and promote widespread data dissemination among research communities cutting across clinical, translational and epidemiological domains, primarily through collaboration with the established CardioVascular Research Grid (CVRG). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity which contributes substantially to rising health care costs and consequently constitutes a major public health burden. Therefore, understanding the genetic and environmental effects on these CVD traits is important. Massive epidemiological study data are needed to detect the small individual effects of genes and their interactions, and integration of multiple epidemiological studies are necessary for generating large sample sizes. Unfortunately, integrating information from multiple studies in a meaningful manner requires the development of data ontologies (language and grammar). Our proposal addresses this need, and does this in a way that is informative and user-friendly from the End User’s point of view.",DEVELOPMENT OF DATA ONTOLOGIES FOR INTEGRATING MULTI-CENTER CARDIOVASCULAR STUDIE,7558424,R01HL094286,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Family Study', 'Ferrets', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'interest', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'software development', 'software systems', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'working group']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,488000,-0.014489198641286614
"Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Classification methods applied to microarray data have largely been those developed by the machine learning community, since the large p (number of covariates) problem is inherent in high-throughput genomic experiments. The random forest (RF) methodology has been demonstrated to be competitive with other machine learning approaches (e.g., neural networks and support vector machines). Apart from improved accuracy, a clear advantage of the RF method in comparison to most machine learning approaches is that variable importance measures are provided by the algorithm. Therefore, one can assess the relative importance each gene has on the predictive model. In a large number of applications, the class to be predicted may be inherently ordinal. Examples of ordinal responses include TNM stage (I,II,III, IV); drug toxicity (none, mild, moderate, severe); or response to treatment classified as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. These responses are ordinal; while there is an inherent ordering among the responses, there is no known underlying numerical relationship between them. While one can apply standard nominal response methods to ordinal response data, in so doing one loses the ordered information inherent in the data. Since ordinal classification methods have been largely neglected in the machine learning literature, the specific aims of this proposal are to (1) extend the recursive partitioning and RF methodologies for predicting an ordinal response by developing computational tools for the R programming environment; (2) evaluate the proposed ordinal classification methods against alternative methods using simulated, benchmark, and gene expression datasets; (3) develop and evaluate methods for assessing variable importance when interest is in predicting an ordinal response. Novel splitting criteria for classification tree growing and methods for estimating variable importance are proposed, which appropriately take the nature of the ordinal response into consideration. In addition, the Generalized Gini index and ordered twoing methods will be studied under the ensemble learning framework, which has not been previously conducted. This project is significant to the scientific community since the ordinal classification methods to be made available from this project will be broadly applicable to a variety of health, social, and behavioral research fields, which commonly collect responses on an ordinal scale.           n/a",Recursive partitioning and ensemble methods for classifying an ordinal response,7470967,R03LM009347,"['Algorithms', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Drug toxicity', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Image Analysis', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Northern Blotting', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Relative (related person)', 'Simulate', 'Stable Disease', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Trees', 'computerized tools', 'forest', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'neglect', 'novel', 'partial response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tumor']",NLM,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,74521,-0.013006647967483902
"Predicting Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric Critical Illness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad purpose of this proposal is to create a framework for bedside decision support to predict life threatening events before they happen. The specific hypothesis is that models predicting cardiac arrest can be generated from physiologic and laboratory data obtained in the 12 hours preceding the event using logistic regression analysis (LR) and data mining techniques such as support vector machines (SVM), neural networks (NN), Bayesian networks (BN) and decision tree classification (DTC). We further hypothesize that a support vector machine technique will yield the model with the best performance. Specific Aim 1 is to acquire and prepare data for eligible patients by merging information from physiologic, laboratory, and clinical databases and selecting data from twelve hours prior to either a cardiac arrest or the maximum severity of illness. Noise will be removed with automated methods that can be used in real time. Missing data elements will be imputed by statistical methods that are regarded as state of the art. Since the optimum time window to investigate before an arrest has not been established, and since there is no standard process of abstracting trend information, we will generate multiple candidate data sets in an effort to determine the optimum combination of parameters. Data dimensionality will be reduced by three separate feature selection methods, each of which will be used in subsequent modeling procedures. Specific Aim 2 is to create cardiac arrest prediction models from the candidate data sets using LR, SVM, NN, BN and DTC. We will assess model performance with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUROC) using 10- fold cross validation. We will then assess the ability to generalize by testing the model on unseen data. We will determine the impact of training sample size on model performance by varying the percentage of data used during the 10-fold cross validation for each modeling technique's best performing model. We will then perform a false prediction analysis to determine the etiology of the false prediction. Specific Aim 3 is to determine which modeling process and configuration parameters performs the best, and to determine optimum timing windows for: time to analyze pre-arrest and size of feature window. The significance of this proposal is that successful prediction and early intervention could save thousands of lives annually.          n/a",Predicting Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric Critical Illness,7363692,K22LM008389,"['Adverse event', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hour', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Performance', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Sciences', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'inclusion criteria', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'size', 'tool', 'trend', 'vector']",NLM,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K22,2008,135000,-0.02047847665611499
"Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The work proposed in this new investigator initiated project studies the hypothesis that machine learning-based text classification techniques can add significant efficiencies to the process of updating systematic reviews (SRs). Because new information constantly becomes available, medicine is constantly changing, and SRs must undergo periodic updates in order to correctly represent the best available medical knowledge at a given time.       To support studying this hypothesis, the work proposed here will undertake four specific aims:   1. Refinement and further development of text classification algorithms optimized for use in classifying   literature for the update of systematic reviews on a variety of therapeutic domains. Comparative analysis using several different machine learning techniques and strategies will be studied, as well as various means of representing the journal articles as feature vectors input to the process.   2. Identification and evaluation of systematic review expert preferences and trade offs between high recall and high precision classification systems. There are several opportunities for including this technology in the process of creating SRs. Each of these applications has separate and unique precision and recall tradeoff thresholds that will be studied based on the benefit to systematic reviews.   3. Prospective evaluation of text classification algorithms. We will verify that our approach performs as   expected on future data.   4. Development of comprehensive gold standard test and training sets to motivate and evaluate the   proposed and future work in this area.      The long term relevance of this research to public health is that automated document classification will   enable more efficient use of expert resources to create systematic reviews. This will increase both the   number and quality of reviews for a given level of public support. Since up-to-date systematic reviews are essential for establishing widespread high quality practice standards and guidelines, the overall public health will benefit from this work.          n/a",Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification,7468470,R01LM009501,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review, Systematic (PT)', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'expectation', 'journal article', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'text searching', 'vector']",NLM,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,286582,-0.02032126200890105
"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data.

"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software.

"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC) proposal aims to provide a flexible analysis resource for the ENCODE project. The ENCODE project is a large multi center project which aims to define all the functional elements in the human genome. This will be achieved using many different experimental techniques coupled with numerous computational techniques. A critical part in delivering this set of functional elements is the integration of data from multiple sources. The ED AC proposal aims to provide this integration. As proscribed by the RFA for this proposal, the precise prioritization for the EDAC's work will be set by an external group, the Analysis Working Group (AWG). Based on previous experience, these analysis methods will require a variety of techniques. We expect to have to apply sophisticated statistical models to the integration of the data, in particular mitigating the problems of the extensive heterogeneity and correlation of variables on the human genome. We have statistical experts who can use the large size of the human genome, coupled with a limited number of sensible assumptions to produce statistical techniques which are robust to this considerable heterogeneity. We also expect to apply machine learning techniques to build integration methods combining datasets. These included Bayesian based inference methods and the robust computer science technique of Support Vector Machines. Each of these methods have performed well in the ENCODE pilot project and we expect them to be even more useful in the full ENCODE project. We will also provide quality assurance and summary metrics of genome-wide multiple alignments. This area has a number of complex statistical, algorithmic and engineering issues, which we will solve using state of the art techniques. Overall we aim to provide deep integration of the ENCODE data, under the direction of the AWG and in tight collaboration with the other members of the ENCODE consortium.           n/a",EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center,7499147,U01HG004695,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Be++ element', 'Behavior', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Publications', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Transcript', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'experience', 'experimental analysis', 'foot', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'size', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U01,2008,1200000,-0.009112614917858586
"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,7469442,R01GM072740,"['Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Class', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Dependence', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear RNA', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Introns', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'falls', 'genetic selection', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'size', 'solid state']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2008,291756,-0.03683923335646692
"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.) The predictions will be available through a searchable and constantly updated Web server. We will also develop a method to detect functional misannotations and apply it to all public metabolic databases. 4.) In collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. Uwe Sauer (ETH Zurich) and Dr. George Church (Harvard) we will experimentally test at least 50 of the predicted genes without close sequence homologs in E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae.           n/a",Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities,7496031,R01GM079759,"['Animal Model', 'Arts', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Church', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Orphan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Sequence Homology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'metabolomics', 'protein function', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,383732,-0.030790197264714353
"Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Metabolic pathway databases provide a biological framework in which relationships among an organism's genes may be revealed. This context can be exploited to boost the accuracy of genome annotation, to discover new targets for therapeutics, or to engineer metabolic pathways in bacteria to produce a historically expensive drug cheaply and quickly. But, knowledge of metabolism in ill-characterized species is limited and dependent on computational predictions of pathways. Our ultimate target is to develop methods for the prediction of novel metabolic pathways in any organism, coupled with robust assessment of the validity of any predicted pathway. We hypothesize that integrating evidence from multiple levels of an organism's metabolic network - from the fit of a pathway within the network to evolutionary relationships between pathways - will allow us to assess pathway validity and to predict novel metabolic pathways. We have successfully applied machine learning methods to the problem of identifying missing enzymes in metabolic pathways and believe similar methods will prove fruitful in this application. Our preliminary studies have identified several properties of predicted metabolic pathways that differ between sets of true positive pathway predictions (i.e., pathways known to occur in an organism) and sets of false positive pathway predictions. We will expand on these features and develop methods to address the following specific aims:      1) Identify features that are informative in distinguishing between correct and incorrect pathway predictions in computationally-generated pathway/genome databases based on predictions for highly-curated organisms (e.g., Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis thaliana).   2) Develop methods for computing the probability that a pathway is correctly predicted. Informative features identified in Specific Aim #1 will be integrated into a classifier that will compute the probability that a predicted pathway is correct given the associated evidence.   3) Extend the Pathologic program (the Pathway Tools algorithm used to infer the metabolic network of an organism) to predict alternate, previously unknown pathways in an organism. We will search the MetaCyc reaction space (comprising almost 6000 reactions) for novel subpathways, explicitly constraining our search using organism-specific evidence (i.e., homology, experimental evidence, etc.) at each step.          n/a",Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types,7504002,R01LM009651,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antimalarials', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia', 'Escherichia coli', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mouse-ear Cress', 'Organism', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Prodrugs', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'genome database', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NLM,SRI INTERNATIONAL,R01,2008,176002,-0.010856348605739806

"A Simulation Tool to Enable Identification of Critical Network Interactions Using    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the main challenges in the discovery of intracellular biomarkers and identification of therapeutic targets is the lack of a mechanistic understanding of the complex underlying pathways. The tremendous increase in both the quantity and diversity of cellular data represents a significant challenge to researchers seeking to construct biologically relevant interaction maps, and objectively extract specific actionable information. Machine learning based clustering algorithms serve as a preliminary statistical data analysis metric, but they fail to capture the data in the proper biological context. While chemical kinetics based models have proved to be effective in elucidating the pathway mechanisms, accurate estimates for the model parameters are severely lacking and are often impossible to obtain owing to the inherent difficulties involved in making dynamic measurements of specific intracellular phenomena. Additionally, methods for rational prioritization and selection of critical intracellular interactions (in the absence of kinetic information) are sorely lacking. Therefore, there is a clear need for innovative software tools that enable quantitative analysis of available microarray data in a biological pathway context, ultimately leading to the objective identification of critical biological interactions, providing a direction for more focused future efforts. We propose to address this challenge by developing an automated software platform that utilizes microarray data to select and merge relevant canonical biological pathway models thereby placing significantly expressed genes in their biological context. The analysis software will utilize a microarray expression-weighted metric to objectively rank the most critical interactions within the network model using a novel chemical kinetics-free Boolean dynamics algorithm. In the Phase I effort, we will develop a software tool composed of an R library that enables the automated generation of a pathway model from a given microarray dataset. Additionally, a methodology, and associated R library will be developed to objectively rank critical interactions in the pathway model, using a microarray data expression-weighted metric. Demonstration and validation of proposed algorithm will be carried out using a well characterized lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage system. In Phase II, we will extend the scope of the algorithmic framework to include proteomic and metabolomic weighting in the objective ranking of critical interactions, and add workflow improvements through the addition of a graphical user interface (GUI). Experimental verification and validation of critical interactions identified in Phase I will be carried out using gene-silencing techniques. We also intend to establish collaborative partnerships with commercial entities. The proposing team has extensive experience in the areas of systems biology and bioinformatics (CFDRC) and microarray data analysis (Shawn Levy, University of Vanderbilt). CFDRC has a strong track record in the commercialization of software and hardware. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Recently, there has been a tremendous increase in both the amount and diversity of cellular data available to researchers, representing a clear need for the development of advanced computational analysis software to enable the discovery of biomarkers of disease states, and identification of new therapeutic targets. However, currently available analysis tools do not consider the data in a proper biological context.

"Stochastic dynamics for multiscale biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Complex biological systems are increasingly subject to investigation by mathematical modeling in general and stochastic simulation in particular. Advanced mathematical methods will be used to generate next-generation computational methods and algorithms for (1) formulating these models, (2) simulating or sampling their stochastic dynamics, (3) reducing them to simpler approximating models for use in multiscale simulation, and (4) optimizing their unknown or partly known parameters to fit observed behaviors and/or measurements. The proposed methods are based on advances in applied statistical and stochastic mathematics, including advances arising from operator algebra, quantum field theory, stochastic processes, statistical physics, machine learning, and related mathematically grounded fields. A central technique in this work will be the use of the operator algebra formulation of the chemical master equation.       The biological systems to be studied include and are representative of high-value biomedical target systems whose complexity and spatiotemporal scale requires improved mathematical and computational methods, to obtain the scientific understanding underlying future medical intervention. Cancer research is broadly engaged in signal transduction systems and complexes with feedback, for which the yeast Ste5 MARK pathway is a model system. DNA damage sensing (through ATM) and repair control (though p53 and Mdm2) are at least equally important to cancer research owing to the central role that failure of these systems play in many cancers.

"Nation Center: Multi-Scale Study- Cellular Networks(RMI) A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genomewide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 1 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 2 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions. n/a",Nation Center: Multi-Scale Study- Cellular Networks(RMI),7674889,U54CA121852,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genomics', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Published Comment', 'Range', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Signal Pathway', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Work', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'response', 'software systems', 'structural biology', 'tool', 'usability']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2008,113826,-0.01287271378016687

"Efficient software and algorithms for analyzing markers data on general pedigree    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to develop an efficient, extensible, modular, and accessible software toolbox that facilitates statistical methods for analyzing complex pedigrees. The toolbox will consist of novel algorithms that extend state of the art algorithms from graph theory, statistics, artificial intelligence, and genetics. This tool will enhance capabilities to analyze genetic components of inherited diseases. The specific aim of this project is to develop an extensible software system for efficiently computing pedigree likelihood for complex diseases in the presence of multiple polymorphic markers, and SNP markers, in fully general pedigrees taking into account qualitative (discrete) and quantitative traits and a variety of disease models. Our experience shows that by building on top of the insight gained within the last decade from the study of computational probability, in particular, from the theory of probabilistic networks, we can construct a software system whose functionality, speed, and extensibility is unmatched by current linkage software. We plan to integrate these new methods into an existing linkage analysis software, called superlink, which is already gaining momentum for analyzing large pedigrees. We will also continue to work with several participating genetic units in research hospitals and improve the software quality and reliability as we proceed with algorithmic improvements. In this project we will develop novel algorithms for more efficient likelihood calculations and more efficient maximization algorithms for the most general pedigrees. These algorithms will remove redundancy due to determinism, use cashing of partial results effectively, and determine close-to-optimal order of operations taking into account these enhancements. Time-space trade-offs will be computed that allow to use memory space in the most effective way, and to automatically determine on which portions of a complex pedigree exact computations are infeasible. In such cases, a combination of exact computations with intelligent use of approximation techniques, such as variational methods and sampling, will be employed. In particular we will focus on advancing sampling schemes such as MCMC used in the Morgan program and integrating it with exact computation. A serious effort will be devoted for quality control, interface design, and integration with complementing available software with the active help of current users of Superlink and Morgan. PUBLIC SUMMARY: The availability of extensive DMA measurements and new computational techniques provides the opportunity to decipher genetic components of inherited diseases.

"Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of this application is to continue our challenge to empower faculty at institutions with high minority enrollment to develop and submit competitive research proposals. Building on our past experience, the competing renewal has three facets which will take place concurrently: 1) up-dating current modules (14) and the development, testing, and evaluation of two new internet course modules; 2) recruitment and training of participants through 5 workshops at remote sites and subsequent participation in the web-based course; 3) continuing evaluation of the training modules for the purpose of technological and content versions. Significant changes from the original program include moving the pre-course conference off-site to maximize the number of faculty participating from contiguous institutions and the introduction of machine language technology to aid in the editing and packaging of participants' grant writing efforts. At the conclusion of the initiative, each participant should be both motivated and empowered to submit a competitive proposal. Thus, our continuing partnership with NIGMS should improve the skills and abilities of researchers/grant writers at minority institutions, increase the number of minorities engaged in biomedical research, and strengthen minority institution's overall research environment. n/a",Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals,7459910,U13GM058252,"['Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects Database', 'Computer software', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grant Review Process', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Progress Reports', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'impression', 'improved', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'skills', 'symposium', 'training project']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,U13,2008,118789,-0.015664782566452397
"Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent and continuing technological advances are producing large amounts of disparate data about cell structure, function and activity. This is driving the development of tools for storing, mining, analyzing, visualizing and integrating data. This proposal describes the VisANT system: a tool for visual data mining that operates on a local database which includes results from our lab, as well as automatically updated proteomics data from web accessible databases such as MIPS and BIND. In addition to accessing its own database, a name normalization table (i.e. a dictionary of identifiers), permits the system to seamlessly retrieve sequence, disease and other data from sources such as GenBank and OMIM. The visualization tool is able to reversibly group related sets of nodes, and display and duplicate their internal structure, providing an approach to hierarchical representation and modeling. We propose to build further on these unique features by including capabilities for mining and representing chemical reactions, orthologous networks, combinatorially regulated transcriptional networks, splice variants and functional hierarchies. Software is open source, and the system also allows users to exchange and integrate the networks that they discover with those of others.           n/a","Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis",7457647,R01RR022971,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genbank', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Information Systems', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Numbers', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Score', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'data mining', 'improved', 'models and simulation', 'open source', 'outreach', 'protein protein interaction', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web-accessible', 'wiki']",NCRR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2008,437938,-0.0067238657438045985
"Optimal Micro-Data Switching: An Enhanced Framework and Decision Tool for Confid    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is the development of an innovative technique to avoid disclosure of confidential data in public use tabular data. Our proposed technique, called Optimal Data Switching (OS), overcomes the limitations and disadvantages found in currently deployed disclosure limitation methods. Statistical databases for public use pose a critical problem of identifying how to make the data available for analysis without disclosing information that would infringe on privacy, violate confidentiality, or endanger national security. Organizations in both the public and private sectors have a major stake in this confidentiality protection problem, given the fact that access to data is essential for advancing research and formulating policy. Yet, the possibility of extracting certain sensitive elements of information from the data can jeopardize the welfare of these organizations and potentially, in some instances, the welfare of the society in which they operate. The challenge is, therefore, to represent the data in a form that permits accurate analysis for supporting research, decision-making and policy initiatives, while preventing an unscrupulous or ill-intentioned party from exploiting the data for harmful consequences. Our goal is to build on the latest advances in optimization, to which the OptTek Systems, Inc. (OptTek) research team has made pioneering contributions, to provide a framework based on optimal data switching, enabling the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other organizations to effectively meet the challenge of confidentiality protection. The framework we propose is structured to be easy to use in a wide array of application settings and diverse user environments, from client-server to web-based, regardless of whether the micro-data is continuous, ordinal, binary, or any combination of these types. The successful development of such a framework, and the computer-based method for implementing it, is badly needed and will be of value to many types of organizations, not only in the public sector but also in the private sector, for whom the incentive to publish data is both economic as well as scientific. Examples in the public sector are evident, where organizations like CDC and the U.S. Census Bureau exist for the purpose of collecting, analyzing and publishing data for analysis by other parties. Numerous examples are also encountered in the private sector, notably in banking and financial services, healthcare (including drug companies and medical research institutions), market research, oil exploration, computational biology, renewable and sustainable energy, retail sales, product development, and a wide variety of other areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the process of accumulating and disseminating public health data for reporting purposes, various uses, and statistical analysis, we must guarantee that individual records describing each person or establishment are protected. Organizations in both the public and private sectors have a major stake in this confidentiality protection problem, given the fact that access to data is essential for advancing research and formulating policy. This project proposes the development of a robust methodology and practical framework to deliver an efficient and effective tool to protect the confidentiality in published tabular data.                      n/a",Optimal Micro-Data Switching: An Enhanced Framework and Decision Tool for Confid,7535414,R43MH086138,"['Accounting', 'American', 'Area', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Client', 'Computational Biology', 'Confidentiality', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disclosure', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Institution', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Security', 'Oils', 'Online Systems', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Policy Making', 'Privacy', 'Private Sector', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Respondent', 'Sales', 'Services', 'Social Welfare', 'Societies', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'desire', 'innovation', 'interest', 'prevent', 'tool']",NIMH,"OPTTEK SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2008,99843,-0.00036773140750709116
"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          n/a",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,7467204,R01LM009719,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Human Genome Project', 'Improve Access', 'International', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Text', 'Time', 'Today', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Writing', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'biomedical informatics', 'concept', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'repository', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,280000,-0.022080245470145147
"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently a gap exists between the explosion of high-throughput data generation in molecular biology and the relatively slower growth of reliable functional information extracted from the data. This gap is largely due to the lack of specificity necessary for accurate gene function prediction in the currently available large-scale experimental technologies for rapid protein function assessment. Bioinformatics methods that integrate diverse data sources in their analysis achieve higher accuracy and thus alleviate this lack of specificity, but there's a paucity of generalizable, efficient, and accurate methods for data integration. In addition, no efficient methods exist to effectively display diverse genomic data, even though visualization has been very valuable for analysis of data from large scale technologies such as gene expression microarrays. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop an accurate and generalizable bioinformatics framework for integrated analysis and visualization of heterogeneous biological data.      We propose to address the data integration problem with a Bayesian network approach and effective visualization methods. We have shown the efficacy of this method in a proof-of-principle system that increased the accuracy of gene function prediction for Saccharomyces cerevisiae compared to individual data sources. Building on our previous work, we present a two-part plan to improve and expand our system and to develop novel visualization methods for genomic data based on the scalable display technology. First, we will investigate the computational and theoretical issues behind accurate integration, analysis and effective visualization of heterogeneous high-throughput data. Then, leveraging our existing system and algorithmic improvements developed in the first part of the project, we will design and implement a full-scale data integration and function prediction system for Saccharomyces cerevisiae that will be incorporated with the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), a model organism database for yeast.      The proposed system would provide highly accurate automatic function prediction that can accelerate genomic functional annotation through targeted experimental testing. Furthermore, our system will perform general integration and will offer researchers a unified view of the diverse high-throughput data through effective integration and visualization tools, thereby facilitating hypothesis generation and data analysis. Our scalable visualization methods will enable teams of researchers to examine biological data interactively and thus support the highly collaborative nature of genomic research. In addition to contributing to S. cerevisiae genomics, the technology for efficient and accurate heterogeneous data integration and visualization developed as a result of this proposal will form a basis for systems that address the same set of issues for other organisms, including the human. n/a",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,7404447,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Compatible', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Explosion', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Phenotype', 'Pliability', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteomics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Saccharomyces', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer based statistical methods', 'concept', 'data integration', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome database', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'parallel computing', 'programs', 'protein function', 'prototype', 'research study', 'software development', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'ultra high resolution', 'web interface']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,243004,-0.012007764559782062
"Integrated Analysis of Genome-Wide Array Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop an integrated desktop application to combine data from expression array, RNA transcript array, proteomics, SNP array (for polymorphism an analysis, as well as LOH and copy number determination), methylation array, histone modification array, promoter array, and microRNA array and metabolomics technologies. Current approaches to analysis of individual `omic' technologies suffer from problems of fragmentation, that present an incomplete view of the workings of the cell. However, effective integration into a single analytic platform is non-trivial. There is a need for a consistent approach, infrastructure, and interface between array types, to maximize ease of use, while recognizing and accommodating the specific computational and statistical requirements, and biological context, of each array. A central challenge is the need to create and work with lists of genomic regions of interest (GROIs) for each sample: we propose three novel approaches to aid in identification of GROIs. These lists must then be integrated with rectangular (sample by feature) data arrays to facilitate statistical analysis. Integration between array types occurs at the computational level, through a unified software package, statistically, through tools that seek statistical relationships between features from different arrays, biologically, through use of annotations (particularly gene ontology, protein- protein and protein-DNA interactions, and pathway membership) that document functional relationships between features, and through genomic interactions that suggest relationships between features that map to the same regions of the genome. The end product will support analysis of each platform separately, with a comprehensive suite of data management, statistical and heuristic analytic tools and the means to place findings of interest into a meaningful biological context through cross-reference to extensive biobases. Beyond that, a range of methods - statistical, biological and genomic - will be available to explore interactions and associations between platforms.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While the large-scale array technologies have provided an unprecedented capability to model cellular processes, both in normal functioning and disease states, this capability is utterly dependent on the availability of complex data management, computational, statistical and informatic software tools.  The utility of the next generation of arrays - which focus on critical regulation and control functions of the cell - will be stymied by an initial lack of suitable bioinformatic tools.  This proposal initiates an accelerated development of an integrated software package intended to empower biologists in the application and analysis of these powerful new technologies, with broadly reaching impact at all levels of biological and clinical research, and across every discipline.          n/a",Integrated Analysis of Genome-Wide Array Data,7538527,R43HG004677,"['Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bite', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA copy number', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'GDF15 gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heating', 'Histones', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'PLAB Protein', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Regulation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Software Tools', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Transcript', 'Work', 'base', 'data management', 'genome-wide analysis', 'heuristics', 'high throughput technology', 'interest', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,EPICENTER SOFTWARE,R43,2008,157474,-0.03467175024411744
"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials. We propose to study novel methods for analyzing the large-scale biomedical data to realize their full potential of molecular diagnosis and prognosis of transplant rejection prediction for critical early treatment.          n/a",Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data,7386333,R01GM083345,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Experimental Designs', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Graft Rejection', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Oncogene Activation', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer microarray', 'cancer type', 'design', 'desire', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney allograft', 'method development', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'theories', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2008,255036,-0.06873887134185583

"Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs), namely ulcerative colitis (DC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic, lifelong, relapsing illnesses, affecting close to 1 million Americans. Despite the many clues that a dysbiosis may exist in IBD, the specific changes in the microflora of IBD patients are largely unknown. Amplicon length heterogeneity (ALH) is a sophisticated and well established PCR based technology that can be used as a screening tool to identify changes in the Bacterial microflora of IBD patients. We therefore have hypothesized that the ileocolonic microflora in IBD has an altered microbial composition compared to normal microflora. We have gathered preliminary data that shows statistical differences between controls and IBD as well as within IBD patients. Therefore, to test the above hypothesis, we are proposing the following 2 inter-related scientific aims: AIM 1. Identify bacterial fingerprint patterns associated with IBD using ALH. ALH patterns will be determined in a total of 160 IBD patients and health controls and will be analyzed using diversity indeces, multivariate reduction analysis and cluster analysis. ALH patterns associated with IBD will be determined using histograms, ecological software in conjunction with custom PERL scripts as well as supervised and unsupervised automated pattern recognition systems. AIM 2.Determine the bacterial contents of putatively IBD associated ALH fingerprint patterns using molecular cloning and sequencing. Cloning and sequencing of targeted samples will be linked to bacterial identities by employing multiple bioinformatics tools. Significance. This proposal involves the first time use of a sophisticated and highly reproducible molecular biology tool, ALH, in the study of microflora in the Gl tract. There is a growing recognition of the importance of microflora in health and disease, including IBD. Studies that characterized microflora in human using powerful techniques from environmental microbiology such as ALH can bring about significant advances in the understanding of Gl tract illnesses. ALH may enable a real-time survey of microfloral changes for the first time in medicine and may provide the first evidence linking IBD with specific microbial patterns.           n/a",Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,7434510,R21DK071838,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bispecific Antibody 2B1', 'Celiac Disease', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cloning', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal part of ileum', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Environmental Microbiology', 'Feces', 'Fingerprint', 'Flare', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genus Cola', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intestines', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Cloning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pattern Recognition Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Probiotics', 'Procedures', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Soil', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visual', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disabling disease', 'ileum', 'indexing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prebiotics', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIDDK,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2008,181300,-0.021949076396513455
"Detection of Drug Effects in Small Groups Using PET    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop optimized image analysis pipelines for pharmaceutical evaluation based on functional neuroimaging, in particular based on positron emission tomography (PET). Strength of drug effect will be assessed using statistical measures of detection power, reproducibility of spatial activation patterns, and regional power estimates. Spatial parametric images will be computed for each of the prediction models investigated. A wide range of predictive models, including many that are new to the functional neuroimaging field, will be implemented and evaluated within a sophisticated statistical resampling framework. A grid-aware software package will be developed based on the results obtained. This software is intended to be run in-house in a distributed computing environment at Predictek to provide state-of-the-art optimized image analysis services to its customers. A scaled-down user-friendly Java implementation of some of the best- performing methods (based on evaluations performed in the project) will also be developed for distribution to end users wishing to perform advanced analyses themselves.

"Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to conduct basic and applied biomedical research is becoming increasingly dependent on data produced by new and emerging technologies. This data has an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Researchers are therefore dependent on computing and computational tools to be able to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data. Tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are common goals of many, if not all, biomedical research programs. Sound analytical and statistical theory and methodology for class pre- diction and class discovery lay the foundation for building these tools, of which the machine learning techniques of classification (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised learning) are crucial. Our goal is to produce software for analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies. Ensemble techniques are recent advances in machine learning theory and methodology leading to great improvements in accuracy and stability in data set analysis and interpretation. The results from a committee of primary machine learners (classifiers or clusterers) that have been trained on different instance or feature subsets are combined through techniques such as voting. The high prediction accuracy of classifier ensembles (such as boosting, bagging, and random forests) has generated much excitement in the statistics and machine learning communities. Recent research extends the ensemble methodology to clustering, where class information is unavailable, also yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy and stability. In theory, most ensemble techniques are inherently parallel. However, existing implementations are generally serial and assume the data set is memory resident. Therefore current software will not scale to the large data sets produced in today's biomedical research. We propose to take two approaches to scale ensemble techniques to large data sets: data partitioning approaches and parallel computing. The focus of Phase I will be to prototype scalable classifier ensembles using parallel architectures. We intend to: establish the parallel computing infrastructures; produce a preliminary architecture and software design; investigate a wide range of ensemble generation schemes using data partitioning strategies; and implement scalable bagging and random forests based on the preliminary design. The focus of Phase II will be to complete the software architecture and implement the scalable classifier ensembles and scalable clusterer ensembles within this framework. We intend to: complete research and development of classifier ensembles; extend the classification framework to clusterer ensembles; research and develop a unified interface for building ensembles with differing generation mechanisms and combination strategies; and evaluate the effectiveness of the software on simulated and real data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The common goals to many, if not all, biomedical research programs are the development of tools for disease detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. These programs often rely on new types of data that have an unprecedented amount of detail and volume. Our goal is to produce software for the analysis and interpretation of large data sets using ensemble machine learning techniques and parallel computing technologies to enable researchers who are dependent on computational tools to have the ability to visualize, analyze, model, and interpret these large and complex sets of data.          n/a",Scalable Learning with Ensemble Techniques and Parallel Computing,7748401,R44GM083965,"['Learning', 'Techniques', 'parallel computing']",NIGMS,INSILICOS,R44,2008,143361,0.01479563576556501
"Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software with Automated Gating    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software Project described in this grant application is designed to create a new, more efficient and effective way of analyzing cells for the presence of cancer, HIV/AIDS and other disease, using a fully automated software system. Using modern data mining techniques (pattern recognition, feature recognition, image analysis) we will design software which will analyze data (the cell samples from patients) at a much faster rate and with fewer false positives and negatives than the manual method now in use. Objectives: Assemble and validate algorithms in software that can automatically classify regions of interest in flow cytometry data. We will demonstrate that the particular populations required by our use cases can be validly, rigorously and repeatably identified automatically. Develop and validate graphical and statistical results that satisfy FDA requirements for medical device software, simplify regulatory compliance by the clinical user, and automatically deliver analysis results to diagnostic expert systems and/or LIMS systems. Satisfy the  translational medicine  goals outlined in the NIH Roadmap. This software will bring the clinician streamlined testing currently only available in research labs. Methods: Four use cases have been selected, one employing synthetic data and three clinical data; Leukemia/Lymphoma test, Analysis of longitudinal Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD) in bone marrow transplant specimens for predictive markers and HIV/AIDS - Gag-specific T cell cytokine response profile assay. For each we have access to a substantial body of existing data, analyzed by experts. Beginning with the autogating routines in our own FlowJo software, we will test and expand the application of Magnetic gating, Probability Clustering, Subtractive Cluster Analysis, Artificial Neural and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Using a sampling of human operators to establish a control range, we will test each of these five techniques against the four use cases in cooperation with our collaborators. Events in the manually classified samples are given a weighted score based on the frequency with which they are included by all the operators. A single operator's score or the gating algorithm's score is compared with the cumulative score of the expert group and a match rating is computed. Additional validation techniques include combinatory validation on internal measures with respect to Pareto optimality, and Predictive Power/Stability self consistency checks using resampled or perturbed data measured with external indices such as the adjusted Rand index and the Variation of Information index.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By eliminating the operator's time, we estimate that the cost of clinical flow cytometry analysis can be reduced to half the current figure while delivering the results much faster. By eliminating the subjectivity and human error of manually created regions and reducing the range of variability of the so created, there would result fewer false positives and false negatives, improving the clinical outcome for those patients needing therapy but undetected by current methods. An order of magnitude increase in speed means faster therapeutic intervention.  A less expensive test improves outcome by making the test accessible to more patients.          n/a",Clinical Cytometry Analysis Software with Automated Gating,7482923,R43RR024094,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Files', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gagging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Voting', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data mining', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NCRR,"TREE STAR, INC.",R43,2008,100854,-0.024586317863409927
"Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal seeks to establish a universally applicable and robust predictive ADME-Tox modeling framework based on rigorous Quantitative Structure Activity/Property Relationships (QSAR/QSPR) modeling. The framework has been refined in the course of many years of our research in the areas of QSPR methodology development and application to experimental datasets that led to novel analytical approaches, descriptors, model validation schemes, overall QSPR workflow design, and multiple end-point studies. This proposal focuses on the design of optimized QSPR protocols for the development of reliable predictors of critically important ADME-Tox properties. The ADME properties will include, but not limited to, water solubility, membrane permeability, P450 metabolism inhibition and induction, metabolic stability, human intestinal absorption, bioavailability, transporters and PK data; a variety of toxicological end-points vital to human health will be explored; they are available from recent initiatives on development and standardization of toxicity data, such as the US FDA, NIEHS, and EPA DSS-Tox and other database projects. The ultimate goal of this project is sharing both modeling software and specialized predictors with the research community via a web-based Predictive ADME-Tox Portal. The project objectives will be achieved via concurrent development of QSPR methodology (Specific Aim 1), building highly predictive, robust QSPR models of known ADME-Tox properties (Specific Aim 2), and the deployment of both modeling software and individual predictors via a specialized web-portal (Specific Aim 3). To achieve the goals of this project focusing on the development and delivery of specialized tools and rigorous predictors, we have assembled a research team of mostly senior investigators with complimentary skills and track records of accomplishment in the areas of computational drug discovery, experimental toxicology, statistical modeling, and software development and integration; two of the team members have had recent industrial experience before transitioning to academia. To the best of our knowledge, the results of this proposal will lead to the first publicly available in silico ADME-Tox modeling framework and predictors that can be used by the research community to analyze any set of chemicals (i.e., virtual and real compound sets).

"Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs) are a group of structurally diverse compounds that include pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants.  They can elicit a number of adverse health effects such as hormone dependent cancers, reproductive tract abnormalities, compromised reproductive fitness, and impaired cognitive abilities.  In order to fully assess the potential adverse effects of synthetic and natural EEDs, a more comprehensive understanding of their molecular, metabolic, and tissue level effects is required within the context of a whole organism.  This collaborative proposal will elucidate the pathways, networks and signaling cascades perturbed by EEDs using the complementary multidisciplinary expertise of its team members in the areas of toxicology, molecular biology, endocrinology, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, data management and advanced data analysis.  The comparative effects of ethynyl estradiol (EE), genistein (GEN), and o, p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) on metabolite levels will be assessed in urine, serum and liver extracts by multinuclear (i. e., 1H, 13C, 31P) NMR spectroscopy, and complemented with histopathology examination and gene expression data from ongoing microarray studies in both mouse and rat models.  All data will be stored and archived in dbZach, a MIAME-compliant toxicogenomic supportive database that facilitates data analysis, the integration of disparate data sets, the exchange of data between investigators, and the deposition of data into public repositories.  Advanced statistical approaches, modeling and data integration tools such as neural networks, data fusion, and Baysean inference will be used to fuse these disparate data sets in order to elucidate the conserved biological networks that are of importance in response to endogenous estrogens.  Moreover, EED perturbed pathways associated with elicited effects will be further defined.  Results from these studies will not only further define the physiologic and toxic mechanisms of action of estrogenic compounds but will also demonstrate the synergy of fusing complementary microarray, metabolomic and histopathology data into a comprehensive integrative computational model.  This approach will also demonstrate the ability to maximize knowledge extraction from all disparate data available within the proposed innovative data management system when used with the advanced information tools that will be developed.            n/a",Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor,7440169,R01ES013927,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endocrinology', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genistein', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Histopathology', 'Hormones', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver Extract', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Multinuclear NMR', 'Mus', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Numbers', 'Organ Weight', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Whole Organism', 'aqueous', 'comparative', 'data integration', 'data management', 'dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane', 'dietary supplements', 'estrogenic endocrine disruptor', 'experience', 'fitness', 'innovation', 'member', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'tool']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,535031,-0.019127938120422926

"System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the NIH call for Exploratory Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing, PAR-06-223, and it will involve a collaboration between Columbia University's MAGNet NCBC and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aim of the proposal is a system-wide tudy of integrated transcriptional and metabolic networks in Eschericia coli K-12 strain, aiming at a similar analysis of a pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, at a later date. LANL hosts an experimental research program on bacterial metabolomics. Metabolites serve several functions. The most common one is being the precursors to various cellular components. They are also regulators of cellular functions by means of modulating metabolic reactions or binding to transcription factors and subsequently regulating gene expression. Conversely, the genes regulated by a transcription factor often encode enzymes, modulating the speed of metabolic reactions. Thus, to understand and ultimately predict the cellular response to an environmental change of interest (e.g., pathogen entry into its host environment), we must integrate the analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. To address this need, we will work with the laboratories of Pat Unkefer and John Dunbar, which will produce data sets of about 300 joint metabolic/transcriptional profiles of E.coli under different steady-state growth conditions. The resources of MAGnet NCBC, specifically the algorithms within the geWorkbench bioinformatics platform produced by the center, will be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. Specifically, we expect that ARACNE, an algorithm originally developed by MAGNet for high-fidelity analysis of transcriptional networks in mammalian cells, is well positioned for reconstruction of metabolic networks from high throughput system-wide metabolic activity data, provide that appropriate modifications to deal with the specifics of the metabolic data are made. We will also adapt the algorithm to discover modulated interactions, that is, metabolic interactions that are conditional on the activity of a modulator gene (enzyme), or transcriptional interactions that require the presence of a metabolite to proceed. Such integrated genome/metabolome analysis has not been attempted yet. It will be a giant leap towards a complete understanding of cellular processes in an important organism. Because of the comparatively small size of bacterial genomes and metabolomes, it will be possible to perform system-wide analyses of interactions for the entire integrated genome and metabolome. While important in its own right, especially in view of the pathogenic nature of B. anthracis, this research would also represent an important test bed for a subsequent study of metabolic diseases in higher animals, including humans.           n/a",System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism,7387471,R21GM080216,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacillus anthracis', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Concentration measurement', 'Condition', 'Crystallography', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Gene', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forging', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2008,220227,-0.029274522378967993
"National Alliance-Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC)(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The National Alliance for Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC) is a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, software engineers, and medical investigators who develop computational tools for the analysis and visualization of medical image data. The purpose of the center is to provide the infrastructure and environment for the development of computational algorithms and open source technologies, and then oversee the training and dissemination of these tools to the medical research community. This world-class software and development environment serves as a foundation for accelerating the development and deployment of computational tools that are readily accessible to the medical research community. The team combines cutting-edge computer vision research (to create medical imaging analysis algorithms) with state-of-the-art software engineering techniques (based on ""extreme"" programming techniques in a distributed, open-source environment) to enable computational examination of both basic neuroscience and neurological disorders. In developing this infrastructure resource, the team will significantly expand upon proven open systems technology and platforms. The driving biological projects will come initially from the study of schizophrenia, but the methods will be applicable to many other diseases. The computational tools and open systems technologies and platforms developed by NAMIC will initially be used to study anatomical structures and connectivity patterns in the brain, derangements of which have long been thought to play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia. The overall analysis will occur at a range of scales, and will occur across a range of modalities including diffusion MRI, quantitative EGG, and metabolic and receptor PET, but potentially including microscopic, genomic, and other image data. It will apply to image data from individual patients, and to studies executed across large populations. The data will be taken from subjects across a wide range of time scales and ultimately apply to a broad range of diseases in a broad range of organs.             n/a",National Alliance-Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC)(RMI),7479786,U54EB005149,[' '],NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U54,2008,3534631,-0.0006478773579626625
"National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions.         n/a",National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI),7502135,U54CA121852,[' '],NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2008,3570137,-0.01165943131229927
"Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Microbial threats, including bioterrorism and naturally emerging infectious diseases, pose a serious challenge to national security in the United States and to health worldwide.  This proposal describes the creation of a center for computational modeling of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with the collaboration of key experts at the Brookings Institution, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the University of Maryland, and Imperial College (London).  The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.  Data analysis will be guided by the insight that epidemic patterns over space and time can be approached as nearly decomposable systems, in which frequency components of the incidence signal can be isolated and studied.  Wavelet transforms, and empiric mode decomposition using Hilbert-Huang Transforms, will be used to sift nonlinear, nonstationary epidemiological data, allowing frequency band patterns to be defined.  Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.  Features of the basic model include variable social network structures, individual susceptibility and immunity, incubation periods, transmission rates, contact rates, and other selectable parameters.  After the agent-based model is calibrated to generate epidemic patterns consistent with real world epidemiology, preventive strategies including vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other public health measures will be systematically introduced and their impact evaluated.  Methods will be developed for assessing the utility of individual models, and for making decisions based on combined results from more than one model.  Infectious diseases to be studied initially include smallpox, SARS, dengue, West Nile, and unknown but hypothetically plausible agents.  As part of a Cooperative Agreement, the Center will work with other research groups, a bioinformatics core group, and the NIGMS to develop data sets, software and methods, agent-based models, and visualization tools.

WormBase will include up-to-date annotation of the genomic data, the current genetic and physical maps and many experimental data such as genome-scale datasets connected to the function and interactions of cells and genes, as well as development, physiology and behavior. Direct access to the sources of biological material, such as the strain collection of the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center and direct links to data sets maintained by others will be provided. Data will be recovered from the existing resources, from direct contribution of the individual laboratories, and from the literature. While WormBase will act as a central forum through which every laboratory will be able to contribute constructively to the global effort to fully comprehend this metazoan organism, WormBase professional curators will ensure detailed attribution of data sources and check consistency and integrity. To facilitate communication, WormBase will use technology, terminology and style concordant with other databases wherever possible. WormBase will maintain ontologies for nematode anatomy and phenotypes. WormBase will be Web-based and easy to use. Multiple relational databases will be used for data management; the object-based Acedb database system will be used for integration, and this integrated database plus ""slave"" relational databases will be used to drive the website. Coordination of the project and the main curation site will be at Caltech under the supervision of a C. elegans biologist. Curation and annotation of genomic sequence will take place at the centers - the Sanger Institute and Washington University - that generated the entire genome sequence. Oxford University will maintain genetic nomenclature.  Nematodes (roundworms) are major parasites of humans, livestock and crops, and extension of WormBase to broader coverage of nematode genomics will facilitate research into the diagnosis and treatment of nematode-based disease. Studies of C. elegans have informed us of basic principles of normal development and the molecular basis of aging, cancer, nicotine addiction, as well as a variety of fundamental biological processes such as cell migration, cell differentiation and cell death.              n/a",WormBase: a core data resource for C elegans and other nematodes,7502984,P41HG002223,"['Ablation', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Base Sequence', 'Behavior', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caenorhabditis', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Comparative Anatomy', 'Compatible', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Processes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Livestock', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nomenclature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic nematode', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Chromosome Mapping', 'Physiology', 'Pliability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Interference', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Slave', 'Source', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Transcript', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cell motility', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'comparative', 'comparative genomic hybridization', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'member', 'migration', 'model organisms databases', 'programs', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability', 'web interface', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NHGRI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,P41,2008,2750000,-0.03264161057602929
"Semantics and Services enabled Problem Solving Environment for Trypanosoma cruzi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of complex biological systems increasingly depends on vast amounts of dynamic information from diverse sources. The scientific analysis of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T.cruzi), the principal causative agent of human Chagas disease, is the driving biological application of this proposal. Approximately 18 million people, predominantly in Latin America, are infected with the T.cruzi parasite. As many as 40 percent of these are predicted eventually to suffer from Chagas disease, which is the leading cause of heart disease and sudden death in middle-aged adults in the region. Research on T. cruzi is therefore an important human disease related effort. It has reached a critical juncture with the quantities of experimental data being generated by labs around the world, due in large part to the publication of the T.cruzi genome in 2005. Although this research has the potential to improve human health significantly, the data being generated exist in independent heterogeneous databases with poor integration and accessibility. The scientific objectives of this research proposal are to develop and deploy a novel ontology-driven semantic problem-solving environment (PSE) for T.cruzi. This is in collaboration with the National Center for Biomedical Ontologies (NCBO) and will leverage its resources to achieve the objectives of this proposal as well as effectively to disseminate results to the broader life science community, including researchers in human pathogens. The PSE allows the dynamic integration of local and public data to answer biological questions at multiple levels of granularity. The PSE will utilize state-of- the-art semantic technologies for effective querying of multiple databases and, just as important, feature an intuitive and comprehensive set of interfaces for usability and easy adoption by biologists. Included in the multimodal datasets will be the genomic data and the associated bioinformatics predictions, functional information from metabolic pathways, experimental data from mass spectrometry and microarray experiments, and textual information from Pubmed. Researchers will be able to use and contribute to a rigorously curated T.cruzi knowledge base that will make it reusable and extensible. The resources developed as part of this proposal will be also useful to researchers in T.cruzi related kinetoplastids, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major (among other pathogenic organisms), which use similar research protocols and face similar informatics challenges. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The scientific objective of this proposal is to develop and deploy a novel ontology-driven semantic problem-solving environment (PSE) for Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that infects approximately 18 million people, predominantly in Latin America. As many as 40 percent of those infected are predicted to eventually suffer from Chagas disease, the leading cause of heart disease and sudden death in middle-aged adults in the region. Facilitating T.cruzi research through the PSE, with the aim of identifying vaccine, diagnostic, and therapeutic targets, is an important human disease related endeavor.          n/a",Semantics and Services enabled Problem Solving Environment for Trypanosoma cruzi,7428761,R01HL087795,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Automobile Driving', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body of uterus', 'Buffaloes', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chagas Disease', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Doctor of Public Health', 'Drops', 'Drosophila genus', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronics', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Imagery', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Information Management', 'Information Resources', 'Information Services', 'Information Technology', 'International', 'Internet', 'Interruption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Organism', 'Language', 'Latin America', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Leishmania major', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oregon', 'Organism', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Philosophy', 'Physiology', 'Prevention strategy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Range', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Sudden Death', 'Sum', 'System', 'TAF8 gene', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trypanosoma brucei brucei', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'USA Georgia', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vaccines', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Victoria Austrailia', 'Virtual Library', 'Virus', 'Western Asia Georgia', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical scientist', 'college', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'computer science', 'concept', 'data integration', 'design', 'desire', 'fundamental research', 'human disease', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovative technologies', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'middle age', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'outreach', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'repository', 'research and development', 'research study', 'syntax', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,393930,-0.013593182484981578
"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: This application responds to RFA: PAR-07-249, ""Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing"". The goal of this project is to develop and widely distribute a software package for robust measurement of brain structure in MR images by using computational neuroanatomy methods. The project will collaborate with the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) to develop the software using the NA-MIC Software Engineering Process, leverage the NA-MIC engineering infrastructure, and integrate this software into the 3D Slicer, a well-architected application environment being developed in NA-MIC. The particular software package will include both a brain image registration and warping algorithm, called HAMMER, and an algorithm for the segmentation of white matter lesions (WMLs), which can arise from a variety of pathologies including vascular pathology and multiple sclerosis. HAMMER received 2006 Best Paper Award from IEEE Signal Processing Society. HAMMER has been successfully applied to many large clinical research studies and clinical trials involving over 5,000 MR brain images and has been downloaded by 318 users from 102 institutions in over 20 countries. The WML segmentation algorithm has been successfully applied to ""Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Memory in Diabetes"" (ACCORD-MIND) sub- study, with data acquired from 4 centers on 650 patients over a period of 8 years. Designing an easy-to-use, robust software package for these two algorithms and incorporating it into the 3D Slicer will benefit a large community of end-users that need access to advanced image analysis methods in various neuroimaging studies. To increase the robustness of the algorithms to the highly variable quality and characteristics of clinical image data, further algorithm development is necessary. To increase ease of use by non-experts in computer analysis methods and integrate this software into the Slicer platform, significant software engineering efforts are planned. Three aims will be investigated. The first aim is to further develop and extend novel image analysis methods aiming at improving the robustness and performance of HAMMER registration and WML segmentation algorithms, so that they can be easily applied to various clinical research studies. The second and third aims are to design separate software modules for these two algorithms, and to incorporate them into the 3D Slicer. These two modules will be designed (1) with consistent cross-platform interactive and scripted interfaces, (2) allowing end-users to interactively explore the suitable parameters for their data, (3) enabling developers to add new functions. The robustness of these two modules will be extensively tested and improved by both software engineering tools and various clinical research data (acquired from different centers). The final software will be freely available in both source code and pre-compiled programs.

"Machine Learning Applied to Automated Planar Patch Clamps    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The introduction of automated planar patch clamp instruments over the past two years has increased the throughput of voltage clamp ion channel assays by a factor of at least ten. This is possible because the automated systems can perform assays in parallel using16 and 384-well plates. While the drug discovery industry has embraced this new technology, the enthusiasm has been tempered by the modest success rates of the assays and by the high cost of the consumable patch substrate. Currently, typical success rates for a standard ion channel assay, using, for example, the Q-Patch from Sophion Biosciences, the Port-a-Patch system from Nanion Biosciences, or the PatchXpress from Molecular Devices Corp., is around 50%. In other words, for every16 channel chip used in these systems, only eight will produce useable data. This effectively doubles the price of each data point over what is ideally possible. In order for a planar patch clamp experiment to succeed, several events need to occur (assuming that the cell expresses the appropriate ion channels in functional states): the cell of interest must form a high-resistance seal with the planar substrate, the whole-cell configuration must be achieved, and fluidic pathways must be intact so that compounds of interest maybe applied to the cell. A failure of anyone of these steps will result in no data collected from that well. We propose to optimize the first two steps in this process, namely, seal formation and entry into whole-cell recording configuration. We will use machine learning approaches to examine how a human patch clamp expert interacts with the patch clamp system in order to develop a model that will provide parameters that can be used to more efficiently and successfully provide useable whole-cell recording configuration. It is important to note that the model that we derive from our approach will not actually copy what the expert does, but will attempt to optimize the process based on cues that mayor may not be consciously monitored by the expert. The Specific Aims of the Phase I component will be to: (1) integrate recording capabilities into existing automated patch clamp software from Nanion, (2) evaluate the success rate of the procedure specified by our machine learning analysis, and (3) develop stand-alone software for use specifically with manual patch clamp setups and for exploration of the potential benefits of using machine learning via expert training in other applications. In Phase II we propose to develop the proof-of-concept software into a user-friendly commercial software module which we will offer to existing and potential automated patch clamp companies. We will also simplify and streamline the user interface of this software as a stand-alone component for manual patch clamp systems. Developing drugs that target ion channels has been hindered by the expense of the consumables used in automated patch clamp screening devices. We propose to develop a method, using machine learning techniques which may increase the success rate of these instruments and therefore lower the overall cost of ion channel drug discovery.          n/a",Machine Learning Applied to Automated Planar Patch Clamps,7220448,R43EB007148,"['Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Employee Strikes', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Ion Channel', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Running', 'Sales', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Suction', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cell type', 'concept', 'cost', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'new technology', 'patch clamp', 'programs', 'research study', 'seal', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'voltage', 'voltage clamp']",NIBIB,BLATZ SCIENTIFIC,R43,2007,199389,-0.03280912704504323
"Predicting Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric Critical Illness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad purpose of this proposal is to create a framework for bedside decision support to predict life threatening events before they happen. The specific hypothesis is that models predicting cardiac arrest can be generated from physiologic and laboratory data obtained in the 12 hours preceding the event using logistic regression analysis (LR) and data mining techniques such as support vector machines (SVM), neural networks (NN), Bayesian networks (BN) and decision tree classification (DTC). We further hypothesize that a support vector machine technique will yield the model with the best performance. Specific Aim 1 is to acquire and prepare data for eligible patients by merging information from physiologic, laboratory, and clinical databases and selecting data from twelve hours prior to either a cardiac arrest or the maximum severity of illness. Noise will be removed with automated methods that can be used in real time. Missing data elements will be imputed by statistical methods that are regarded as state of the art. Since the optimum time window to investigate before an arrest has not been established, and since there is no standard process of abstracting trend information, we will generate multiple candidate data sets in an effort to determine the optimum combination of parameters. Data dimensionality will be reduced by three separate feature selection methods, each of which will be used in subsequent modeling procedures. Specific Aim 2 is to create cardiac arrest prediction models from the candidate data sets using LR, SVM, NN, BN and DTC. We will assess model performance with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUROC) using 10- fold cross validation. We will then assess the ability to generalize by testing the model on unseen data. We will determine the impact of training sample size on model performance by varying the percentage of data used during the 10-fold cross validation for each modeling technique's best performing model. We will then perform a false prediction analysis to determine the etiology of the false prediction. Specific Aim 3 is to determine which modeling process and configuration parameters performs the best, and to determine optimum timing windows for: time to analyze pre-arrest and size of feature window. The significance of this proposal is that successful prediction and early intervention could save thousands of lives annually.          n/a",Predicting Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric Critical Illness,7222736,K22LM008389,"['Adverse event', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hour', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Performance', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Sciences', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'inclusion criteria', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'size', 'tool', 'trend', 'vector']",NLM,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K22,2007,135000,-0.02047847665611499
"Assisting Systematic Review Preparation Using Automated Document Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The work proposed in this new investigator initiated project studies the hypothesis that machine learning-based text classification techniques can add significant efficiencies to the process of updating systematic reviews (SRs). Because new information constantly becomes available, medicine is constantly changing, and SRs must undergo periodic updates in order to correctly represent the best available medical knowledge at a given time.       To support studying this hypothesis, the work proposed here will undertake four specific aims:   1. Refinement and further development of text classification algorithms optimized for use in classifying   literature for the update of systematic reviews on a variety of therapeutic domains. Comparative analysis using several different machine learning techniques and strategies will be studied, as well as various means of representing the journal articles as feature vectors input to the process.   2. Identification and evaluation of systematic review expert preferences and trade offs between high recall and high precision classification systems. There are several opportunities for including this technology in the process of creating SRs. Each of these applications has separate and unique precision and recall tradeoff thresholds that will be studied based on the benefit to systematic reviews.   3. Prospective evaluation of text classification algorithms. We will verify that our approach performs as   expected on future data.   4. Development of comprehensive gold standard test and training sets to motivate and evaluate the   proposed and future work in this area.      The long term relevance of this research to public health is that automated document classification will   enable more efficient use of expert resources to create systematic reviews. This will increase both the   number and quality of reviews for a given level of public support.

"Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid and accurate triage is essential when dealing with acutely injured persons. To that end, a number of trauma triage decision aids have been proposed. Unfortunately, mistriage rates for trauma patients remain high, due in part to aids that lack precision or discrimination, are not used, or are misused or misapplied. Improving the trauma triage process is an important problem because doing so improves trauma triage outcomes by optimizing access to and utilization of specialized resources as well as reducing morbidity and mortality. A promising method for improving this process is to integrate machine learning algorithms as a rapid and accurate clinical decision support technique. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop rules to diagnosis myocardial infarction and to provide rapid and accurate decision support in nonmedical settings. They have also been used to predict mortality following injury. Furthermore, using machine learning algorithms for clinical decision support employs highly accurate predictive models to counter the previously mentioned pitfalls of existing trauma decision aids in the following ways: (1) collecting relevant readily available clinical information, (2) choosing the most accurate predictive model for the situation at hand, and (3) utilizing computational speed and power to optimize predictive accuracy. The goal of this AREA proposal is to test the feasibility of machine learning-based predictive modeling techniques to support trauma triage. We plan to use well-established predictive model development and evaluation techniques to: (1) Compare the existing American College of Surgeons trauma triage decision aid to four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques; (2) Compare the performance of four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques with and without a novel measure of change in physiological status; and (3) Compare the performance of full machine learning models to those derived using information gathered as a byproduct of the workflow. Models will predict persons with severe injury or need for specialized trauma resources. Successful integration of machine learning algorithms is a first step toward developing an adaptive computer assisted trauma triage system that not only helps clinicians make better decisions but also facilitates rapid access to specialized resources.           n/a",Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT),7252385,R15GM080697,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Records', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Numbers', 'Operating Rooms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Speed', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'injured', 'innovation', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,R15,2007,216300,-0.01616656006226241
"A RuleFit Product for Classification and Regression Prediction and data exploration are important aspects of modern commercial and scientific life. Regression methods predict dependent variables (e.g., tumor growth, severity of disease), while classification methods predict class membership (e.g., tumor or disease type). Both use a vector of independent variables to make the predictions. Because they are often superior predictors, can handle large numbers observations and large numbers of variables, can often yield insight into the data not provided by other methods, and because they can adapt to arbitrarily complex relationships, modern machine learning methods based on tree ensembles such as RANDOM FORESTS and MART have become leading modern analytical methods. Here we propose to commercially implement RULEFIT, a recent innovative method extending the RANDOM FORESTS and MART approaches, that shows strong evidence of being consistently more accurate than either ensemble. RULEFIT also includes groundbreaking new methods for variable selection in the face of huge numbers of predictors, and for identifying interactions, and ranking their importance. Optionally, RULEFIT extracts ""rules"" of special interest: succinct statements of conditions under which an outcome is especially likely or unlikely, or especially large or small. The primary output of RULEFIT is a numeric value reecting a prediction of the value of the dependent variable or the probability of a class membership. RULEFIT is likely to become a leading technique in the machine learning and statistics. It builds on RANDOM FORESTS and MART and includes all their useful benefits such as variable selection, data exploration, data reduction, outlier detection, and missing value imputation, while enhancing and extending these benefits.  COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL The market for advanced analytical tools has been growing strongly over the last decade and the growth shows no signs of diminishing. Modelers and data analysts in both university- based and commercial settings are increasingly aware of the power and value of new analytical tools derived from modern statistics and machine learning research. The increased accuracy of the new methods and the acceleration they provide to the analysis of complex data are fueling demand for this new technology. The advances embedded in the proposed product represent substantial improvements to existing technology and include methods to solve vexing problems in contemporary data analysis, and thus should find a welcoming market.  There are further reasons to forecast robust commercial potential for this product. The applicant organization has a strong track record in the industry and is widely recognized as a developer of high quality software. We have been working with consultant Friedman since 1990 and have gained exclusive rights to the proprietary sourcecode for a number of his innovations. These include CART, MARS, MART and PRIM. With the addition of RULEFIT and its associated sub-components, these products represent a unique collection of pedigreed tools. We have also forged a similar relationship with the (late) Leo Breiman and have the exclusive rights to commercialization of Breiman's Random Forests sourcecode. Our proposed package thus occupies a distinctive position in machine learning software which cannot be replicated by other vendors.

"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software. Furthermore, computational strategies will be explored based on global optimization techniques, particularly convex programming and difference convex programming.           n/a",New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data,7299383,R01GM081535,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Class', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Consult', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pan Genus', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'gene discovery', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'information classification', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2007,266852,-0.010537516222821874
"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.) The predictions will be available through a searchable and constantly updated Web server. We will also develop a method to detect functional misannotations and apply it to all public metabolic databases. 4.) In collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. Uwe Sauer (ETH Zurich) and Dr. George Church (Harvard) we will experimentally test at least 50 of the predicted genes without close sequence homologs in E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae.           n/a",Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities,7322388,R01GM079759,"['Animal Model', 'Arts', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Church', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Orphan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Sequence Homology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'metabolomics', 'protein function', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,364130,-0.030790197264714353
"Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Metabolic pathway databases provide a biological framework in which relationships among an organism's genes may be revealed. This context can be exploited to boost the accuracy of genome annotation, to discover new targets for therapeutics, or to engineer metabolic pathways in bacteria to produce a historically expensive drug cheaply and quickly. But, knowledge of metabolism in ill-characterized species is limited and dependent on computational predictions of pathways. Our ultimate target is to develop methods for the prediction of novel metabolic pathways in any organism, coupled with robust assessment of the validity of any predicted pathway. We hypothesize that integrating evidence from multiple levels of an organism's metabolic network - from the fit of a pathway within the network to evolutionary relationships between pathways - will allow us to assess pathway validity and to predict novel metabolic pathways. We have successfully applied machine learning methods to the problem of identifying missing enzymes in metabolic pathways and believe similar methods will prove fruitful in this application. Our preliminary studies have identified several properties of predicted metabolic pathways that differ between sets of true positive pathway predictions (i.e., pathways known to occur in an organism) and sets of false positive pathway predictions. We will expand on these features and develop methods to address the following specific aims:      1) Identify features that are informative in distinguishing between correct and incorrect pathway predictions in computationally-generated pathway/genome databases based on predictions for highly-curated organisms (e.g., Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis thaliana).   2) Develop methods for computing the probability that a pathway is correctly predicted. Informative features identified in Specific Aim #1 will be integrated into a classifier that will compute the probability that a predicted pathway is correct given the associated evidence.   3) Extend the Pathologic program (the Pathway Tools algorithm used to infer the metabolic network of an organism) to predict alternate, previously unknown pathways in an organism. We will search the MetaCyc reaction space (comprising almost 6000 reactions) for novel subpathways, explicitly constraining our search using organism-specific evidence (i.e., homology, experimental evidence, etc.) at each step.          n/a",Pathway Prediction and Assessment Integrating Multiple Evidence Types,7301424,R01LM009651,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antimalarials', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia', 'Escherichia coli', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mouse-ear Cress', 'Organism', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Prodrugs', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Score', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'genome database', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NLM,SRI INTERNATIONAL,R01,2007,173307,-0.010856348605739806
"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening. Antibody-based nanopore devices may also serve as highly sensitive immunosensors. n/a",Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions,7286095,K22LM008794,"['Algorithms', 'Altretamine', 'Antibodies', 'Antigenic Specificity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biophysics', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Buffers', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dissociation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Haptens', 'Hemolysin', 'Immunology', 'Informatics', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pliability', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Semiconductors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Toxin', 'Variant', 'antibody engineering', 'antigen antibody binding', 'antigen binding', 'antimicrobial peptide', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experimental analysis', 'markov model', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanopore', 'programs', 'protein structure function', 'prototype', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'tool', 'vector', 'web interface']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),K22,2007,162000,-0.04496274541487617
"The Use of Mathematic Algorithms in the Prevention of Improper Medical Payments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to create software that uses mathematical algorithms to detect medical billing coding errors prior to payment. The well-publicized failure of current healthcare cost containment technologies to prevent improper payments in both the commercial healthcare market and the federal Medicare program highlights the urgent need for a new approach to the growing problem of out of control medical costs. A recent federal study by the GAO estimated that improper payments by Medicare alone were in excess of 21 billion dollars, a truly staggering 48.1 percent of all improper payments by federal programs. Like SPAM, whose dynamic nature makes static or post hoc remedies ineffective, effective cost containment in one area often merely leads to the creation of new areas of abuse. Clearly, the ideal solution is a system that can evaluate the fairness of payments before they are made, and that can respond to dynamic patterns of abuse. The first step in creating such a system is the creation of robust method for sorting bills for appropriate rule-based analysis on the basis of the type of bill. Currently neither Medicare nor major insurers are capable of making this classification reliably except through the use of inefficient, static rules and the use of manual sorting--a costly and inefficient approach to assuring timely payment to hospitals and medical providers. We propose a novel method for using mathematical algorithms that utilize machine-learning (ML) methods to address the problem of medical bill categorization, the first step in coding error detection. Specifically, we propose the evaluation of a variety of genetic algorithms that are well adapted to the problems of large, dynamic datasets and can be ""trained"" using real world correctly coded datasets in healthcare claims. This work is particularly timely due to recent Medicare contracting reform. Using more than 50 contractors and carriers, bill classification is largely determined by the carrier's contract. Centralizing this process to only four payment centers will require the classification system we propose. [This research is directed toward the development of software applications that will detect billing errors and perform proper edits to payment of medical bills. Current anticipated changes and reforms in the Medicare system will require these systems, which do not currently exist in the public or private sector.]             n/a",The Use of Mathematic Algorithms in the Prevention of Improper Medical Payments,7316071,R43LM009190,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Contractor', 'Contracts', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Fraud', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Industry', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Private Sector', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'college', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'mathematical algorithm', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'payment', 'prevent', 'programs', 'size', 'software development', 'stem', 'success']",NLM,"QMEDTRIX SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2007,92482,-0.014040872015677306

"Efficient software and algorithms for analyzing markers data on general pedigree    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to develop an efficient, extensible, modular, and accessible software toolbox that facilitates statistical methods for analyzing complex pedigrees. The toolbox will consist of novel algorithms that extend state of the art algorithms from graph theory, statistics, artificial intelligence, and genetics. This tool will enhance capabilities to analyze genetic components of inherited diseases. The specific aim of this project is to develop an extensible software system for efficiently computing pedigree likelihood for complex diseases in the presence of multiple polymorphic markers, and SNP markers, in fully general pedigrees taking into account qualitative (discrete) and quantitative traits and a variety of disease models. Our experience shows that by building on top of the insight gained within the last decade from the study of computational probability, in particular, from the theory of probabilistic networks, we can construct a software system whose functionality, speed, and extensibility is unmatched by current linkage software. We plan to integrate these new methods into an existing linkage analysis software, called superlink, which is already gaining momentum for analyzing large pedigrees. We will also continue to work with several participating genetic units in research hospitals and improve the software quality and reliability as we proceed with algorithmic improvements. In this project we will develop novel algorithms for more efficient likelihood calculations and more efficient maximization algorithms for the most general pedigrees. These algorithms will remove redundancy due to determinism, use cashing of partial results effectively, and determine close-to-optimal order of operations taking into account these enhancements. Time-space trade-offs will be computed that allow to use memory space in the most effective way, and to automatically determine on which portions of a complex pedigree exact computations are infeasible. In such cases, a combination of exact computations with intelligent use of approximation techniques, such as variational methods and sampling, will be employed. In particular we will focus on advancing sampling schemes such as MCMC used in the Morgan program and integrating it with exact computation. A serious effort will be devoted for quality control, interface design, and integration with complementing available software with the active help of current users of Superlink and Morgan. PUBLIC SUMMARY: The availability of extensive DMA measurements and new computational techniques provides the opportunity to decipher genetic components of inherited diseases.

"Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Bioconductor project provides an open resource for the development and distribution of innovative reliable software for computational biology and bioinformatics. The range of available software is broad and rapidly growing as are both the user community and the developer community. The project maintains a web portal for delivering software and documentation to end users as well as an active mailing list. Additional services for developers include a software archive, mailing list and assistance and advice program development and design      We propose an active development strategy designed to meet new challenges while simultaneously providing user and developer support for existing tools and methods. In particular we emphasize a design strategy that accommodates the imperfect, yet evolving nature of biological knowledge and the relatively rapid development of new experimental technologies. Software solutions must be able to rapidly adapt and to facilitate new problems when they arise.      CRITQUE 1:      The Bioconductor project began in 2001. In 2002 it was awarded a BISTI grant for three years 2003-2006). During this time the project has expanded and provided support for a world wide community of researchers. This is a proposal for continued development for Bioconductor, which is a set of statistical programs which are specifically tailored to the computatational biology community. Bioconductor is composed of over 130 R packages that have been contributed by a large number of developers. The software packages range from state of the art statistical methods which typically are used in microarray analysis, to annotation tools, to plotting functions, GUIs, to sequence alignment and data management packages. Contributions to and usage of Bioconductor is growing rapidly and the applicants are requesting support to continue its development as well as general logistical support for software distribution and quality assurance. The proposal includes a research component for Bioconductor which will involve the development of analysis techniques. This will include optimization of the R statistical analyses, statistical processing of Affymetrix data, analysis of SNP data, improved standards, data storage, retreivals from NCBI, sequence management, machine learning, web services and distributed computing.      SCIENTIFIC MERIT   The applicants address many issues that are crucial to the success of a large open source project with multiple contributors. Examples of training, scientific publication, documentation and resource development run throughout the proposal. Many tangible examples were given on the usage of the system by the scientific community.        EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN   This is a description of their management workflow for the project which does a good job of demonstrating the technical excellence brought to the project by this group. 1) Build annotation packages every three months, Integrate changes in annotation source data structure into annotation package building code. 2) Maintain project website, mailing lists, source control archive. Organize web resources for short course and conferences. 3) Improve existing software. 4) Sustain automated nightly builds. Work with developers whose packages fail to pass QA. 5) Resolve cross-platform issues. 6) Review new submissions. Answer questions on the mailing lists. 7) Use software engineering best practices. Develop unit testing strategies. Design appropriate classes and methods for new data types. Refactor existing code for better interoperability and extensibility. 8) Develop and organize training materials and documentation.      Extensive detail on testing, build procedures, interoperability, quality assurance and project management is given elsewhere in the document. They clearly have dealt with many issues necessary for a project of this size. They state that one of the biggest cost items is support of this package to run on multiple platforms. They point out that many contributors focus on a single platform, much of their work is track down cross-platform bugs. This is time well-spent, given the platforms used are in sync with the needs of the greater bioinformatics community.        ORIGINALITY   While a high degree of originality is not a particularly critical element of open source software development project, there are certainly areas in the proposal that are unique. Most importantly, it is safe to say that there is not another project which has this blend of statistical analysis systems specifically tailored to a important research bioinformatics area that can be deployed on a number of different computer environments.      INVESTIGATOR AND CO-INVESTIGATORS   Dr. Gentleman is the founder and leader of the Bioconductor project. Dr. Gentlemen was an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health and Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute. In 2004 he became Program Head, Computational Biology, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He has on the order of ten publications relating to Bioconductor or related statistical analysis. He implemented the original versions of the R programming language jointly with another co-founder. He is PI or Investigator of a number of research grants, at least two are directly related to this work. He and other members of the proposal have taught a number of courses and given lectures on Bioconductor, the amount of these courses certainly indicate significant dedication to the project.  A review of the PI and Co-PI activities related to this project are shown on Table 3 on page 42 of the application. The roles and time allocations assigned to each participant appear to be reasonable.  Dr. Gentleman will serve as project leader and will manage the programmers, coordinating the project, and investigating new computational methods and approaches.  Dr. Vincent Carey, as co Principal Investigator has 20% time allocated for the project.  In 2005 he became Associate Professor of Medicine (Biostatistics). Carey is a senior member of the Bioconductor development core. He will improve interoperability to allow Bioconductor reuse of external modules in Java, Perl and other languages as well as strengthen interfaces between high throughput experimental workflows and machine learning tools, and ontology capture.  An administrative assistant will assist Dr. Carey with administrative requirements, including call coordination, manuscript preparation and distribution, scheduling and budget management.  Dr. Rafael Irizarry as co-PI will spend 30% effort on the project.  Dr. Irizarry has four years experience developing methods for microarray data analysis and in the Department of Biostatistics serving as faculty liaison to the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution's Microarray Core.  He will supervize all efforts to support preprocessing on all platforms and support for microarray related consortiums such as the ERCC, GEO, and ArrayExpress.      Programmers will be responsible for the project website, managing email lists, maintaining training materials, upgrading software, refactoring and other code enhancements, managing the svn archive, and Bioconductor releases. They will handle checking all submitted packages, developing unit tests, and simplifying downloads, nightly build procedures, cross-platform issues, data technologies as well as integrating resources found in other languages (e.g. large C libraries of routines for string handling, machine learning and so on). Programmers have familiarity with R packages and systems for database management and for parallel and distributed computing. They will be responsible for managing the annotation data including package building and liaising with organism specific and other data providers.      SIGNIFICANCE   Given the scope of the proposal, and the size of the Bioconductor project in general the request for the above resources is appropriate. There is an excellent mix of grounded project management along with development of newer state of the art techniques that will benifit many members of the bioinformatics community. There is a high probability that funding this project will help to maintain and advance this important community resource.      ENVIRONMENT   The computer infrastructure, and the local departments of the PI and Co-PIs, as well as the work with the larger scientific community are all excellent environments to support this project.      IN SUMMARY   This is a terrific resource.  It is a well managed large open source project with very well crafted QA testing, documentation and training.  Continuation of this is a three year project. Beyond that period, a statement of long term stated goals is needed. The PI should articulate the strategic goals, as well as their research motivation and translate that into an action plan. They should also use that context to describe how they would go about choosing packages that are put into the Bioconductor system; Table 3 only listed the names of the packages made by the applicants, it could have gone further to give the reader more information for choosing packages.  A simple example would have been if they stated in the document: ""Given our assessment of the microarray state of the art, we ultimately aim to overlay annotation data, ontological information, and other forms of meta data onto a statistical framework for expression data."" The resulting research plan would then justify a five year project, but it was not strong enough in this application.       It should be noted that many of the benificiaries to this system are not just users that download the system.  In many cases a centralized informatics service downloads their system and then performs analysis for other members of the campus or the wider www community. While that type of ""success measure"" is hard to assess, more effort in this area in subsequent proposals would be helpful.           n/a",Bioconductor: an open computing resource for genomics,7293650,P41HG004059,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Award', 'Bioconductor', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Building Codes', 'Class', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Database Management Systems', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Documentation', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Faculty', 'Familiarity', 'FarGo', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human Genome', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Motivation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Occupations', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organism', 'Participant', 'Policies', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Programming Languages', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Range', 'Reader', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Services', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'lectures', 'member', 'model development', 'open source', 'originality', 'professor', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'research study', 'size', 'software development', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web-accessible']",NHGRI,FRED HUTCHINSON CAN RES CTR,P41,2007,796910,-0.015014428522375289
"Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely believed that crystallization is the rate-limiting step in most X-ray structure determinations. We have therefore been developing computational tools to facilitate this process, including the XtalGrow suite of programs. Here we propose to improve the power and scope of these tools along two fronts: 1. Initial screening, the (iterative) set of experiments that hopefully, yields one or more preliminary ""hits"" (crystalline material that is demonstrably protein); and 2. Optimization experiments that begin with an initial hit and end with diffraction-quality crystals. A central concept of this proposal is that this tool building requires a knowledge-based foundation. Therefore, one of the broad goals of the proposal is to develop a framework for the acquisition and encoding of knowledge in computationally tractable forms; specifically, forms that will yield more effective crystallization procedures. We are interested in how the data interact and how that can be used to improve the crystallization process. While available data, both in the literature and from other projects in the laboratory will continue to be used wherever possible, our analysis has also demonstrated the need to be pro-active i.e. to gather selected data required to complete the knowledge base. We propose to do this by: I. Deepening the data representations is several areas including additional protein characteristics, incorporating a hierarchy of chemical additives and acquiring detailed response data. 11. Improving the efficiency of crystallization screens: Initial crystallization screens would be improved by applying inductive reasoning to the refinement of Bayesian belief nets; procedures would also be developed for dealing with the absence of promising results by identifying unexplored regions of the parameter space and using additional measurements, such as dynamic light scattering and cloud point determinations to further refine the Bayesian belief nets and steer experimentation in more promising directions. Optimization screens would be improved by applying Case-Based and Bayesian methods here as well as by further developments of automated image analysis. III. Improving the ""user friendliness,"" integration and automation of the entire system. n/a",Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization,7269383,R01RR014477,[' '],NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2007,307022,-0.032803259886955774
"Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of this application is to continue our challenge to empower faculty at institutions with high minority enrollment to develop and submit competitive research proposals. Building on our past experience, the competing renewal has three facets which will take place concurrently: 1) up-dating current modules (14) and the development, testing, and evaluation of two new internet course modules; 2) recruitment and training of participants through 5 workshops at remote sites and subsequent participation in the web-based course; 3) continuing evaluation of the training modules for the purpose of technological and content versions. Significant changes from the original program include moving the pre-course conference off-site to maximize the number of faculty participating from contiguous institutions and the introduction of machine language technology to aid in the editing and packaging of participants' grant writing efforts. At the conclusion of the initiative, each participant should be both motivated and empowered to submit a competitive proposal. Thus, our continuing partnership with NIGMS should improve the skills and abilities of researchers/grant writers at minority institutions, increase the number of minorities engaged in biomedical research, and strengthen minority institution's overall research environment. n/a",Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals,7252088,U13GM058252,"['Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects Database', 'Computer software', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grant Review Process', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Progress Reports', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'impression', 'improved', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'skills', 'symposium', 'training project']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,U13,2007,276104,-0.015664782566452397
"Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent and continuing technological advances are producing large amounts of disparate data about cell structure, function and activity. This is driving the development of tools for storing, mining, analyzing, visualizing and integrating data. This proposal describes the VisANT system: a tool for visual data mining that operates on a local database which includes results from our lab, as well as automatically updated proteomics data from web accessible databases such as MIPS and BIND. In addition to accessing its own database, a name normalization table (i.e. a dictionary of identifiers), permits the system to seamlessly retrieve sequence, disease and other data from sources such as GenBank and OMIM. The visualization tool is able to reversibly group related sets of nodes, and display and duplicate their internal structure, providing an approach to hierarchical representation and modeling. We propose to build further on these unique features by including capabilities for mining and representing chemical reactions, orthologous networks, combinatorially regulated transcriptional networks, splice variants and functional hierarchies. Software is open source, and the system also allows users to exchange and integrate the networks that they discover with those of others.           n/a","Visant-Predictome: A System for Integration, Mining Visualization and Analysis",7287965,R01RR022971,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genbank', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Information Systems', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Numbers', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Score', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'data mining', 'improved', 'models and simulation', 'open source', 'outreach', 'protein protein interaction', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web-accessible', 'wiki']",NCRR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2007,446875,-0.0067238657438045985

"Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently a gap exists between the explosion of high-throughput data generation in molecular biology and the relatively slower growth of reliable functional information extracted from the data. This gap is largely due to the lack of specificity necessary for accurate gene function prediction in the currently available large-scale experimental technologies for rapid protein function assessment. Bioinformatics methods that integrate diverse data sources in their analysis achieve higher accuracy and thus alleviate this lack of specificity, but there's a paucity of generalizable, efficient, and accurate methods for data integration. In addition, no efficient methods exist to effectively display diverse genomic data, even though visualization has been very valuable for analysis of data from large scale technologies such as gene expression microarrays. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop an accurate and generalizable bioinformatics framework for integrated analysis and visualization of heterogeneous biological data.      We propose to address the data integration problem with a Bayesian network approach and effective visualization methods. We have shown the efficacy of this method in a proof-of-principle system that increased the accuracy of gene function prediction for Saccharomyces cerevisiae compared to individual data sources. Building on our previous work, we present a two-part plan to improve and expand our system and to develop novel visualization methods for genomic data based on the scalable display technology. First, we will investigate the computational and theoretical issues behind accurate integration, analysis and effective visualization of heterogeneous high-throughput data. Then, leveraging our existing system and algorithmic improvements developed in the first part of the project, we will design and implement a full-scale data integration and function prediction system for Saccharomyces cerevisiae that will be incorporated with the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), a model organism database for yeast.      The proposed system would provide highly accurate automatic function prediction that can accelerate genomic functional annotation through targeted experimental testing. Furthermore, our system will perform general integration and will offer researchers a unified view of the diverse high-throughput data through effective integration and visualization tools, thereby facilitating hypothesis generation and data analysis. Our scalable visualization methods will enable teams of researchers to examine biological data interactively and thus support the highly collaborative nature of genomic research. In addition to contributing to S. cerevisiae genomics, the technology for efficient and accurate heterogeneous data integration and visualization developed as a result of this proposal will form a basis for systems that address the same set of issues for other organisms, including the human. n/a",Integration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,7214148,R01GM071966,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Compatible', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Explosion', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magic', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Phenotype', 'Pliability', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteomics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Saccharomyces', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer based statistical methods', 'concept', 'data integration', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genome database', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'parallel computing', 'programs', 'protein function', 'prototype', 'research study', 'software development', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'ultra high resolution', 'web interface']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,240927,-0.012007764559782062
"Generation and Description of Dendritic Morphology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This continuing project is directed at describing dendrite structure in a compact yet sufficiently complete and detailed fashion to allow the computer generation of morphologically accurate neuronal models. Dendrite morphology plays a fundamental role in physiological and pathological brain function by subserving and shaping network connectivity and by integrating the complex pattern of synaptic inputs received by the neuron. A parsimonious and algorithmic description of dendritic shape is a crucial step towards the quantitative characterization of the structure-activity relationship in the nervous system and it constitutes an effective way to represent, compress, store, exchange, and amplify extremely complex neuroanatomical data. Neuroanatomical algorithms and models have been developed to simulate and quantitatively analyze the three-dimensional structure of dendritic trees in the same format used to represent experimentally reconstructed neurons.      The specific aims of this project are: (1) to expand and improve neuroanatomically plausible algorithms of dendritic structure and development by including determinants of three-dimensional branch orientation and dependence of growth upon local and global influences (e.g. diameter and neuronal size, respectively); (2) to enhance and distribute the analysis, modeling, and data basing software in order to provide experimental and computational neuroscientists with web-based tools to query, retrieve, measure, classify, and synthesize dendritic morphology data; (3) to continue the experimental reconstruction and analysis of hippocampal pyramidal cells and spinal motoneurons with different experimental protocols and in early postnatal periods; and to integrate these data with detailed biophysical models of neuronal electrophysiology. The informatics and neuroscience components of this research are deeply intertwined and span a variety of scientific approaches, including ""wet"" experiments, computational simulations, statistical analysis and data mining. This will require the design and implementation of novel neuroinformatics tools for data handling and integration, and their distribution to the wider neuroscience community.         n/a",Generation and Description of Dendritic Morphology,7233290,R01NS039600,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Dendrites', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscopic', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neonatal', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Spinal', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'insight', 'models and simulation', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,61912,-0.03746719629849211
"Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs), namely ulcerative colitis (DC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic, lifelong, relapsing illnesses, affecting close to 1 million Americans. Despite the many clues that a dysbiosis may exist in IBD, the specific changes in the microflora of IBD patients are largely unknown. Amplicon length heterogeneity (ALH) is a sophisticated and well established PCR based technology that can be used as a screening tool to identify changes in the Bacterial microflora of IBD patients. We therefore have hypothesized that the ileocolonic microflora in IBD has an altered microbial composition compared to normal microflora. We have gathered preliminary data that shows statistical differences between controls and IBD as well as within IBD patients. Therefore, to test the above hypothesis, we are proposing the following 2 inter-related scientific aims: AIM 1. Identify bacterial fingerprint patterns associated with IBD using ALH. ALH patterns will be determined in a total of 160 IBD patients and health controls and will be analyzed using diversity indeces, multivariate reduction analysis and cluster analysis. ALH patterns associated with IBD will be determined using histograms, ecological software in conjunction with custom PERL scripts as well as supervised and unsupervised automated pattern recognition systems. AIM 2.Determine the bacterial contents of putatively IBD associated ALH fingerprint patterns using molecular cloning and sequencing. Cloning and sequencing of targeted samples will be linked to bacterial identities by employing multiple bioinformatics tools. Significance. This proposal involves the first time use of a sophisticated and highly reproducible molecular biology tool, ALH, in the study of microflora in the Gl tract. There is a growing recognition of the importance of microflora in health and disease, including IBD. Studies that characterized microflora in human using powerful techniques from environmental microbiology such as ALH can bring about significant advances in the understanding of Gl tract illnesses. ALH may enable a real-time survey of microfloral changes for the first time in medicine and may provide the first evidence linking IBD with specific microbial patterns.           n/a",Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,7197734,R21DK071838,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bispecific Antibody 2B1', 'Celiac Disease', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cloning', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal part of ileum', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Environmental Microbiology', 'Feces', 'Fingerprint', 'Flare', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genus Cola', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intestines', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Cloning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pattern Recognition Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Probiotics', 'Procedures', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Soil', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visual', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disabling disease', 'ileum', 'indexing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prebiotics', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIDDK,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2007,222000,-0.021949076396513455
"Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal seeks to establish a universally applicable and robust predictive ADME-Tox modeling framework based on rigorous Quantitative Structure Activity/Property Relationships (QSAR/QSPR) modeling. The framework has been refined in the course of many years of our research in the areas of QSPR methodology development and application to experimental datasets that led to novel analytical approaches, descriptors, model validation schemes, overall QSPR workflow design, and multiple end-point studies. This proposal focuses on the design of optimized QSPR protocols for the development of reliable predictors of critically important ADME-Tox properties. The ADME properties will include, but not limited to, water solubility, membrane permeability, P450 metabolism inhibition and induction, metabolic stability, human intestinal absorption, bioavailability, transporters and PK data; a variety of toxicological end-points vital to human health will be explored; they are available from recent initiatives on development and standardization of toxicity data, such as the US FDA, NIEHS, and EPA DSS-Tox and other database projects. The ultimate goal of this project is sharing both modeling software and specialized predictors with the research community via a web-based Predictive ADME-Tox Portal. The project objectives will be achieved via concurrent development of QSPR methodology (Specific Aim 1), building highly predictive, robust QSPR models of known ADME-Tox properties (Specific Aim 2), and the deployment of both modeling software and individual predictors via a specialized web-portal (Specific Aim 3). To achieve the goals of this project focusing on the development and delivery of specialized tools and rigorous predictors, we have assembled a research team of mostly senior investigators with complimentary skills and track records of accomplishment in the areas of computational drug discovery, experimental toxicology, statistical modeling, and software development and integration; two of the team members have had recent industrial experience before transitioning to academia. To the best of our knowledge, the results of this proposal will lead to the first publicly available in silico ADME-Tox modeling framework and predictors that can be used by the research community to analyze any set of chemicals (i.e., virtual and real compound sets). The framework will have a significant impact on compound prioritization, chemical library design, and candidate selection for preclinical and clinical development.            n/a",Robust computational framework for predictive ADME-Tox modeling,7244058,R21GM076059,"['Academia', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Area', 'Biological Availability', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End Point', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Statistically Significant', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'career', 'cluster computing', 'combinatorial', 'computer framework', 'data mining', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'genotoxicity', 'innovation', 'knowledge of results', 'member', 'method development', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'open source', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'reproductive', 'skills', 'small molecule libraries', 'software development', 'tool', 'virtual', 'water solubility']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2007,328325,-0.010999631084346262
"Bayesian Methods and Experimental Design for Molecular Biology Experiments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to provide a suite of software tools for bioinformatics and systems biology researchers who are using molecular biology (Omics) data to identify the best experimental design and to analyze the resulting experimental data using Bayesian tools. A common problem for most bioinformatics experiments is low power due to low replication. This problem can be alleviated economically when an increase in adoption and use of a specific platform leads to a decrease in associated costs, thereby enabling an increase in samples allocated per treatment. Yet, many bioinformatics experiments remain underpowered as researchers use the offsets of decreased costs to explore more complex questions. When designing an experiment, the allocation of samples to treatment regimens, and the choice of treatments to test, are traditionally the only variables to manipulate. Bayesian experimental design provides a framework to find the optimal design out of n possible designs subject to a utility function that can include such items as time and material costs.      Bayesian statistical methods have been gaining substantial favor in bioinformatics and systems biology as they provide a highly flexible framework for fitting and exploring complex models. Bayesian models also provides to domain experts such as biologists and physicians easily interpretable models through posterior probabilities which are more naturally understood than the traditional p-value. While a number of open source tools based on Bayesian models are available, most are applied best in the context of a specific research data analysis problem or model and are not integrated into a single, complete system for data analysis.      We propose to research and develop a statistical analysis software package S+OBAYES (for S-PLUS and R) with generalized tools for Bayesian design of experiments, empirical and fully Bayesian analysis, and modeling and simulation using modern commercial software development practices. These tools will provide functionality for finding the optimal choice and layout of experimental treatments for molecular biology experiments and for fitting Bayesian linear and non-linear models to a variety of data types including time series.

"Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs) are a group of structurally diverse compounds that include pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants.  They can elicit a number of adverse health effects such as hormone dependent cancers, reproductive tract abnormalities, compromised reproductive fitness, and impaired cognitive abilities.  In order to fully assess the potential adverse effects of synthetic and natural EEDs, a more comprehensive understanding of their molecular, metabolic, and tissue level effects is required within the context of a whole organism.  This collaborative proposal will elucidate the pathways, networks and signaling cascades perturbed by EEDs using the complementary multidisciplinary expertise of its team members in the areas of toxicology, molecular biology, endocrinology, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, data management and advanced data analysis.  The comparative effects of ethynyl estradiol (EE), genistein (GEN), and o, p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) on metabolite levels will be assessed in urine, serum and liver extracts by multinuclear (i. e., 1H, 13C, 31P) NMR spectroscopy, and complemented with histopathology examination and gene expression data from ongoing microarray studies in both mouse and rat models.  All data will be stored and archived in dbZach, a MIAME-compliant toxicogenomic supportive database that facilitates data analysis, the integration of disparate data sets, the exchange of data between investigators, and the deposition of data into public repositories.  Advanced statistical approaches, modeling and data integration tools such as neural networks, data fusion, and Baysean inference will be used to fuse these disparate data sets in order to elucidate the conserved biological networks that are of importance in response to endogenous estrogens.  Moreover, EED perturbed pathways associated with elicited effects will be further defined.  Results from these studies will not only further define the physiologic and toxic mechanisms of action of estrogenic compounds but will also demonstrate the synergy of fusing complementary microarray, metabolomic and histopathology data into a comprehensive integrative computational model.  This approach will also demonstrate the ability to maximize knowledge extraction from all disparate data available within the proposed innovative data management system when used with the advanced information tools that will be developed.            n/a",Metabolomic Assessment of Estrogenic Endocrine Disruptor,7240459,R01ES013927,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endocrinology', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Estradiol', 'Estrogens', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genistein', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Histopathology', 'Hormones', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver Extract', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Multinuclear NMR', 'Mus', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Numbers', 'Organ Weight', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiological', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Whole Organism', 'aqueous', 'comparative', 'data integration', 'data management', 'dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane', 'dietary supplements', 'estrogenic endocrine disruptor', 'experience', 'fitness', 'innovation', 'member', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'tool']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,543226,-0.019127938120422926
"Gene Ontology Consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our objective is to provide the scientific community with a consistent, robust information environment for describing, sharing, integrating and comparing the functional roles of genes, proteins and functional RNAs within and across all organisms. The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium is an international collaboration of model organism database and genome annotation groups who have joined together to establish standards for describing genomes and gene products and to provide tools and support for the consistent application of these standards for functional annotations that facilitate and enable biological research. The GO provides specific classifications including well-defined, biologically descriptive terms that are organized into specialization and part-of hierarchies for the domains of genome feature, molecular function, biological process and cellular component. The GO classifications are independent of any particular technology, an uncoupling of terminology from technology that encourages application of these semantic standards by organism annotation groups that utilize a wide range of technical environments. The GO has been widely adopted and used for representation of complex biological information for model organism genomes, and is increasingly used for the functional annotation of emerging genomes. With the increased use of the GO, the Consortium must actively work to ensure both the accuracy of the ontologies as well as consistency and quality of annotations so that these resources may be reliably used to draw inferences and make biological predictions. We will do so by focusing on four key aims: 1) We will maintain logically rigorous and biologically precise ontologies; 2) We will ensure comprehensive annotation of reference genomes, including human, using the GO; 3) We will support GO annotation efforts for emerging genomes and for those specialized sets of genes and proteins of particular community interest; and 4) We will provide annotations and tools to the research community thus supporting experimental biologists, genome informaticists, and computational biologists who are using GO annotations in their research particularly in the areas of functional genomics and comparative biology. The relevance of this work for public health is that comprehensive integration and standardization of biomedical and genomics information is an essential component of advancing the understanding of the molecular systems underlying human health and disease outcomes.             n/a",Gene Ontology Consortium,7185305,P41HG002273,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology, Other', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comparative Biology', 'Complex', 'Computer information processing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'EST Library', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Translating', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'comparative', 'functional genomics', 'genetic element', 'genome database', 'human disease', 'interest', 'model organisms databases', 'repository', 'size', 'tool']",NHGRI,JACKSON LABORATORY,P41,2007,3146180,-0.031129998557510967
"LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The high cost ($0.8 - $1.7 billion) and long time frames (about 13 years) required to introduce new drugs to the market contributes substantially to spiraling health care costs and diseases persisting without effective cures. A major factor is the high attrition rate of new compounds failing due to toxicity identified years into clinical trials. This particular circumstance cost the pharmaceutical industry approximately $8 billion in 2003. In silico tools generally offer the promise of identifying toxicity issues much more rapidly than clinical methods, however, they are not sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical companies to confidently make definitive early screening and related investment decisions. LiverTox is a highly advanced, self-learning liver toxicity prediction tool that represents a quantum leap over current in silico methods. It offers a highly innovative use of multiple analytical approaches to accurately predict the toxicity of candidate Pharmaceuticals in the liver. A differentiating capability is its self-learning computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets. They rapidly assimilate massive volumes of information from LiverTox's extensive, dynamic, and thoroughly reviewed databases. Initially, LiverTox will generate predictions derived from five independent CNN-based submodules; one trained in advanced computational chemistry methods to make quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses; a second trained with microarray data; a third trained with Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing and Gene Expression (MPSS/GE) data; and fourth and fifth submodules trained with proteomics and metabolomics/metabonomics data, respectively. Challenging LiverTox with new chemical formulations triggers the five independent submodules to each make toxicity endpoint predictions drawing upon its knowledge base and its similarity analysis/fuzzy logic/statistical training. This tool's flexible, highly advanced system architecture and advanced learning capabilities using data obtained from diverse techniques enable it to rapidly digest new data, build upon new data acquisition techniques, and use prior lessons learned to achieve overall toxicity predictions with greater than 95% accuracy. LiverTox's ability to rapidly and accurately predict the toxicity of drug candidates will allow pharmaceutical companies to move from discovery to curing disease faster, at greatly reduced cost, and with less reliance on animal-based tests.         n/a",LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction,7214118,R42ES013321,"['Accounting', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug toxicity', 'End Point', 'Expert Systems', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Gene Expression', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'highly advanced system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'metabolomics', 'quantum', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'subtraction hybridization', 'tool']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R42,2007,257269,-0.021821101415947813

"System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the NIH call for Exploratory Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing, PAR-06-223, and it will involve a collaboration between Columbia University's MAGNet NCBC and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aim of the proposal is a system-wide tudy of integrated transcriptional and metabolic networks in Eschericia coli K-12 strain, aiming at a similar analysis of a pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, at a later date. LANL hosts an experimental research program on bacterial metabolomics. Metabolites serve several functions. The most common one is being the precursors to various cellular components. They are also regulators of cellular functions by means of modulating metabolic reactions or binding to transcription factors and subsequently regulating gene expression. Conversely, the genes regulated by a transcription factor often encode enzymes, modulating the speed of metabolic reactions. Thus, to understand and ultimately predict the cellular response to an environmental change of interest (e.g., pathogen entry into its host environment), we must integrate the analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. To address this need, we will work with the laboratories of Pat Unkefer and John Dunbar, which will produce data sets of about 300 joint metabolic/transcriptional profiles of E.coli under different steady-state growth conditions. The resources of MAGnet NCBC, specifically the algorithms within the geWorkbench bioinformatics platform produced by the center, will be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. Specifically, we expect that ARACNE, an algorithm originally developed by MAGNet for high-fidelity analysis of transcriptional networks in mammalian cells, is well positioned for reconstruction of metabolic networks from high throughput system-wide metabolic activity data, provide that appropriate modifications to deal with the specifics of the metabolic data are made. We will also adapt the algorithm to discover modulated interactions, that is, metabolic interactions that are conditional on the activity of a modulator gene (enzyme), or transcriptional interactions that require the presence of a metabolite to proceed. Such integrated genome/metabolome analysis has not been attempted yet. It will be a giant leap towards a complete understanding of cellular processes in an important organism. Because of the comparatively small size of bacterial genomes and metabolomes, it will be possible to perform system-wide analyses of interactions for the entire integrated genome and metabolome. While important in its own right, especially in view of the pathogenic nature of B. anthracis, this research would also represent an important test bed for a subsequent study of metabolic diseases in higher animals, including humans.           n/a",System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism,7234993,R21GM080216,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacillus anthracis', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Concentration measurement', 'Condition', 'Crystallography', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Gene', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forging', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2007,257655,-0.029274522378967993

"Accelerating metabolic discovery using characterization data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of this project is to develop methods that will allow researchers to gain insight into the metabolic networks of organisms for which we have little or no high-throughput data. Such metabolic networks can reveal aspects of the organism's metabolism that might make it vulnerable to new or existing therapies. A core data set using genomic and other omic data from data-rich bacteria that are related to the organisms of interest will be assembled. The statistical tools needed to integrate these data and to infer metabolic networks using these core data plus characterization (phenotypic) data will then be built. Using the statistical inference algorithms, the characterization data can be leveraged to reveal the metabolic networks of data-poor bacteria for which we have only characterization data. This approach can eliminate the need for genome sequencing, gene expression experiments and the like for thousands of Gram-negative facultative rod bacteria (GNF). There are five tasks in the project: (1) assemble the data sets from data-rich organisms that will be used to inform the inference algorithm. These data include (a) the genomic sequences and annotation information, (b) extant pathway data and (c) gene expression data. All these data contain some level of information about the connectivity within the metabolic network; (2) process the genomic data to enhance its predictive value; (3) develop a data integration algorithm; (4) investigate modeling frameworks to be used for Bayesian data fusion and network inference; (5) validate the metabolic networks. Deliverables from this project should include: (1) a set of pathway genome databases for 35 GNF, This group includes 20 strains classified as category A or B biothreat agents, (2) a core dataset that integrates all the information we have relevant to the metabolic pathways in the 35 sequenced GNF, (3) a probabilistic graphical modeling framework capable of integrating disparate types of data and inferring networks from the integrated data, (4) a method for using characterization data, along with deliverables 2 and 3, to infer metabolic networks for bacterial strains for which we have only characterization data. The ability to rapidly construct models of metabolic networks means researchers will be able to respond to emerging infectious agents or biothreats more quickly. Relevance The methods developed as part of this proposal will allow us to quickly make metabolic maps for thousands of bacteria. Such maps can guide researchers to promising new targets for therapeutic or preventative measures against pathogenic bacteria. The fight against well-known pathogens and biothreat agents, as well as against new, emerging pathogens will be greatly aided by these tools.              n/a",Accelerating metabolic discovery using characterization data,7267998,R21AI067543,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American Type Culture Collection', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriology', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Bypass', 'Categories', 'Cholera', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Depth', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Gammaproteobacteria', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gram&apos', 's stain', 'Infectious Agent', 'Information Networks', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Numbers', 'Nutritional', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pathway interactions', 'Plague', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Salmonella typhi', 'Shapes', 'Shigella', 'Shigella Infections', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Typhoid Fever', 'Variant', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Work', 'Writing', 'Yersinia pestis', 'biothreat', 'computerized data processing', 'data integration', 'design', 'falls', 'fight against', 'genome database', 'genome sequencing', 'gram negative facultative rods', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'network models', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'programs', 'research study', 'retinal rods', 'routine Bacterial stain', 'sound', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,AMERICAN TYPE CULTURE COLLECTION,R21,2007,185677,-0.024757783085022397
"National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases. Development will be both driven and tested by the biomedical community to ensure the usefulness of the tools and the usability of the graphical user interfaces to address biomedical problems in completely novel ways, to dissect the web of cellular interactions responsible for cellular processes and functions.         n/a",National Center: Multi-Scale Study of Cellular Networks(RMI),7286779,U54CA121852,[' '],NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2007,3638557,-0.01165943131229927
"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,7261326,R01GM072740,[' '],NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2007,290853,-0.03683923335646692
"Dopaminergic Mechanisms of Reward in Schizophrenia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal has been developed in response to PAR-02-062 (Building Translational Research in Behavioral Science). The goal of the proposed work is to demonstrate that an explicitly translational, multidisciplinary approach to defining the role of dopamine (DA) in schizophrenia (SC), is capable of illuminating some of the most poorly understood, most treatment-resistant cognitive and motivational aspects of the illness. Specifically, recent basic research has shown that DA cell firing plays a critical role in the encoding of reward prediction and reward based learning. The proposed work will provide a rigorous test of the applicability of this hypothesis as a framework for understanding the motivational and learning impairments of SC with important implications for schizophrenia therapeutics. To test this hypothesis, we have organized a group of basic and clinical investigators into three scientific modules:1) electrophysiology, 2) neuroimaging, and 3) behavior, with the overall program designed to address different aspects of same theory of DA function. These modules are designed to develop collaborative partnerships with the results of initial pilot experiments used to refine hypothesis for further experimental testing. Initial studies are proposed to document the specific behavioral, electrophysiological, and fMRI Bold signal abnormalities of SC patients during the performance of reward learning paradigms, the impact of different antipsychotics on reward processing in animals, and the physiological sequela associated with reward-driven changes in DA cell firing. Computational modeling will be used to determine whether the experimental results in animals and observed deficits in patients are consistent with the hypothesized role of DA in reward processing. The overall program is designed to develop resources, paradigms, and proof of principle studies that illuminate the nature of DA dysfunction in SC through the application of translational paradigms and models demonstrating the critical role of DA in reward and reinforcement learning. If successful, the proposed work is designed to establish the conceptual foundation and preliminary data needed to support individual RO1 applications and a Translational Center.         n/a",Dopaminergic Mechanisms of Reward in Schizophrenia,7278791,R24MH072647,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Condition', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Depth', 'Dopamine', 'Dose', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Feedback', 'Fire - disasters', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Habenula', 'Haloperidol', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Study', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cingulate cortex', 'classical conditioning', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'experience', 'hedonic', 'heuristics', 'human study', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'olanzapine', 'programs', 'quetiapine', 'research study', 'response', 'reward circuitry', 'reward processing', 'theories', 'translational approach', 'volunteer']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2007,342842,-0.02183233441129008
"Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Microbial threats, including bioterrorism and naturally emerging infectious diseases, pose a serious challenge to national security in the United States and to health worldwide.  This proposal describes the creation of a center for computational modeling of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with the collaboration of key experts at the Brookings Institution, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the University of Maryland, and Imperial College (London).  The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.  Data analysis will be guided by the insight that epidemic patterns over space and time can be approached as nearly decomposable systems, in which frequency components of the incidence signal can be isolated and studied.  Wavelet transforms, and empiric mode decomposition using Hilbert-Huang Transforms, will be used to sift nonlinear, nonstationary epidemiological data, allowing frequency band patterns to be defined.  Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.  Features of the basic model include variable social network structures, individual susceptibility and immunity, incubation periods, transmission rates, contact rates, and other selectable parameters.  After the agent-based model is calibrated to generate epidemic patterns consistent with real world epidemiology, preventive strategies including vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other public health measures will be systematically introduced and their impact evaluated.  Methods will be developed for assessing the utility of individual models, and for making decisions based on combined results from more than one model.  Infectious diseases to be studied initially include smallpox, SARS, dengue, West Nile, and unknown but hypothetically plausible agents.  As part of a Cooperative Agreement, the Center will work with other research groups, a bioinformatics core group, and the NIGMS to develop data sets, software and methods, agent-based models, and visualization tools.  In an infectious disease epidemic emergency the Center will redirect its activities to serve the nation's security, as guided by the NIGMS. n/a",Computational Models of Infectious Disease Threats,7284239,U01GM070708,"['AIDS therapy', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Academy', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Airborne Particulate Matter', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Americas', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Appendix', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Arthropod Vectors', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Bioterrorism', 'Books', 'Borrelia', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Contact Tracing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Demography', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Earthquakes', 'Ecology', 'Economics', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ehrlichia', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Encephalitis', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Engineering technology', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Faculty', 'Foot-and-Mouth Disease', 'Frequencies', 'Game Theory', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hantavirus', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis E', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hygiene', 'Imagery', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Influenza', 'Informatics', 'Information Services', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leptospira', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'London', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malaria', 'Maryland', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Mathematics', 'Measles', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Modified Smallpox', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'National Security', 'New York', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Observational Study', 'Oceanography', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Physical Dialysis', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Public Policy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Purpose', 'Quarantine', 'Rate', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reference Standards', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rickettsia', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Schedule', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Series', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Space Flight', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Tropical Medicine', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Violence', 'Viral', 'Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Weather', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'base', 'biosecurity', 'c new', 'college', 'computer science', 'concept', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'editorial', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infectious disease model', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'microbial', 'models and simulation', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'peer', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'remote sensing', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social organization', 'sound', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly', 'vaccination strategy']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2007,588968,-0.019644044131435882
"Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely believed that crystallization is the rate-limiting step in most X-ray structure determinations. We have therefore been developing computational tools to facilitate this process, including the XtalGrow suite of programs. Here we propose to improve the power and scope of these tools along two fronts: 1. Initial screening, the (iterative) set of experiments that hopefully, yields one or more preliminary ""hits"" (crystalline material that is demonstrably protein); and 2. Optimization experiments that begin with an initial hit and end with diffraction-quality crystals. A central concept of this proposal is that this tool building requires a knowledge-based foundation. Therefore, one of the broad goals of the proposal is to develop a framework for the acquisition and encoding of knowledge in computationally tractable forms; specifically, forms that will yield more effective crystallization procedures. We are interested in how the data interact and how that can be used to improve the crystallization process. While available data, both in the literature and from other projects in the laboratory will continue to be used wherever possible, our analysis has also demonstrated the need to be pro-active i.e. to gather selected data required to complete the knowledge base. We propose to do this by: I. Deepening the data representations is several areas including additional protein characteristics, incorporating a hierarchy of chemical additives and acquiring detailed response data. 11. Improving the efficiency of crystallization screens: Initial crystallization screens would be improved by applying inductive reasoning to the refinement of Bayesian belief nets; procedures would also be developed for dealing with the absence of promising results by identifying unexplored regions of the parameter space and using additional measurements, such as dynamic light scattering and cloud point determinations to further refine the Bayesian belief nets and steer experimentation in more promising directions. Optimization screens would be improved by applying Case-Based and Bayesian methods here as well as by further developments of automated image analysis. III.

"LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The high cost ($0.8 - $1.7 billion) and long time frames (about 13 years) required to introduce new drugs to the market contributes substantially to spiraling health care costs and diseases persisting without effective cures. A major factor is the high attrition rate of new compounds failing due to toxicity identified years into clinical trials. This particular circumstance cost the pharmaceutical industry approximately $8 billion in 2003. In silico tools generally offer the promise of identifying toxicity issues much more rapidly than clinical methods, however, they are not sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical companies to confidently make definitive early screening and related investment decisions. LiverTox is a highly advanced, self-learning liver toxicity prediction tool that represents a quantum leap over current in silico methods. It offers a highly innovative use of multiple analytical approaches to accurately predict the toxicity of candidate Pharmaceuticals in the liver. A differentiating capability is its self-learning computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets. They rapidly assimilate massive volumes of information from LiverTox's extensive, dynamic, and thoroughly reviewed databases. Initially, LiverTox will generate predictions derived from five independent CNN-based submodules; one trained in advanced computational chemistry methods to make quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses; a second trained with microarray data; a third trained with Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing and Gene Expression (MPSS/GE) data; and fourth and fifth submodules trained with proteomics and metabolomics/metabonomics data, respectively. Challenging LiverTox with new chemical formulations triggers the five independent submodules to each make toxicity endpoint predictions drawing upon its knowledge base and its similarity analysis/fuzzy logic/statistical training. This tool's flexible, highly advanced system architecture and advanced learning capabilities using data obtained from diverse techniques enable it to rapidly digest new data, build upon new data acquisition techniques, and use prior lessons learned to achieve overall toxicity predictions with greater than 95% accuracy. LiverTox's ability to rapidly and accurately predict the toxicity of drug candidates will allow pharmaceutical companies to move from discovery to curing disease faster, at greatly reduced cost, and with less reliance on animal-based tests.         n/a",LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction,7125135,R42ES013321,"['artificial intelligence', 'chemical structure function', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug discovery /isolation', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'hepatotoxin', 'microarray technology', 'toxicant screening']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R42,2006,387181,-0.021821101415947813
"Predicting Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric Critical Illness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad purpose of this proposal is to create a framework for bedside decision support to predict life threatening events before they happen. The specific hypothesis is that models predicting cardiac arrest can be generated from physiologic and laboratory data obtained in the 12 hours preceding the event using logistic regression analysis (LR) and data mining techniques such as support vector machines (SVM), neural networks (NN), Bayesian networks (BN) and decision tree classification (DTC). We further hypothesize that a support vector machine technique will yield the model with the best performance. Specific Aim 1 is to acquire and prepare data for eligible patients by merging information from physiologic, laboratory, and clinical databases and selecting data from twelve hours prior to either a cardiac arrest or the maximum severity of illness. Noise will be removed with automated methods that can be used in real time. Missing data elements will be imputed by statistical methods that are regarded as state of the art. Since the optimum time window to investigate before an arrest has not been established, and since there is no standard process of abstracting trend information, we will generate multiple candidate data sets in an effort to determine the optimum combination of parameters. Data dimensionality will be reduced by three separate feature selection methods, each of which will be used in subsequent modeling procedures. Specific Aim 2 is to create cardiac arrest prediction models from the candidate data sets using LR, SVM, NN, BN and DTC. We will assess model performance with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUROC) using 10- fold cross validation. We will then assess the ability to generalize by testing the model on unseen data. We will determine the impact of training sample size on model performance by varying the percentage of data used during the 10-fold cross validation for each modeling technique's best performing model. We will then perform a false prediction analysis to determine the etiology of the false prediction. Specific Aim 3 is to determine which modeling process and configuration parameters performs the best, and to determine optimum timing windows for: time to analyze pre-arrest and size of feature window. The significance of this proposal is that successful prediction and early intervention could save thousands of lives annually.          n/a",Predicting Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric Critical Illness,7106109,K22LM008389,"['clinical research', 'heart arrest', 'model']",NLM,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K22,2006,135000,-0.02047847665611499
"Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This training proposal describes a research plan which tests the application of a computer science solution to a clinical problem encountered by nurse practitioners (NPs). As our understanding of genetics health increases, NPs will need to provide care and create health promotion regimens mindful of each client's genetic profile. Access to the rapidly developing genetics health literature is critical for this practice model, but may be difficult, because existing search methods lead to many irrelevant results, and may retrieve the proper result only when precise keywords are used. The NP searching for information that would guide her practice may be forced to make a decision with less than complete or current information. This proposal outlines three studies, which investigate how the semantic web concepts of linking related ideas and terms can improve NPs' access to the genetics health literature. Study 1 explores NPs' genetics health information needs. Study 2 tests the applicability of existing ontologies (terminologies coupled with machine-readable statements about the meanings and relationships of the terms) to nursing.

"Simulation Algorithms for Spatial Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This SBIR project is developing methods and software for the specification, construction and simulation of neutral spatial models, and for applying these neutral models within the framework of probabilistic pattern recognition. Results will allow epidemiologists, environmental scientists and image analysts across a broad range of commercial disciplines to more accurately identify patterns in spatial data by removing the bias towards false positives that is caused by unrealistic null hypotheses such as ""complete spatial randomness"" (CSR). This project will accomplish 5 aims:      1. Conduct a requirements analysis to specify the neutral models and functionality to incorporate in the software.   2. Develop and test a software prototype to evaluate feasibility of the proposed models.   3. Propose a topology of neutral models and develop strategies to generate them and to conduct sensitivity analysis for investigating the impact of implicit assumptions (i.e. spatial autocorrelation or non-uniform risk) and number of realizations on test results.   4. Incorporate the neutral models in the first commercially established software package that allows for user-specified alternate hypothesis in spatial statistical tests.   5. Apply the software and methods to demonstrate the approach and its unique benefits for exposure and health risk assessment.      Feasibility of this project was demonstrated in the Phase I. This Phase II project will accomplish aims three through five. These technologic, scientific and commercial innovations will revolutionize our ability to identify, document and assess the probability of spatial patterns relative to neutral models that incorporate realistic local, spatial and multivariate dependencies.

"Computer System for Functional Analysis of Genomic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In two previous stages of this project, both funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and carried out successfully, we developed GeneWays, a completely automated system that efficiently distills information about molecular interactions from an astronomical number of full-text biomedical articles. The next logical stage of the project is to carry this system from the computational laboratory into a practical, useful, and even indispensable tool that researchers can use to solve complex problems currently posed in experimental medicine and biology. The central hypothesis of our work on GeneWays has been that our computational tools will generate biological predictions of a quality sufficiently high that the biomedical community will invest in serious experimental validation. Specifically, we propose the following. 1. We will improve significantly the precision and recall of the GeneWays system. 2. We will develop and implement a probabilistic belief-network formalism?a belief-graph relative of the Bayesian network formalism that allows us to place and update beliefs on both the vertices and the edges of the graph for probabilistic reasoning over the large collection of facts in the GeneWays database. We will develop and implement a coordinated collection of methods for computing and updating beliefs on individual nodes and edges of the belief graph. 3. We will develop and implement a mathematical framework for incorporating pathway information into a genetic- linkage analysis formalism in such a way that each piece of pathway knowledge includes a specified degree of confidence. 4. We will process an enormous collection of texts, such as open-access biomedical journals, PubMed abstracts, and the GeneWays corpus, and thus will build a comprehensive GeneHighWays database. We will make the GeneHighWays database easily and freely accessible to academic researchers through a web interface.

(3) Development of enabling technologies for improved assessment of clinical outcomes. The Roadmap emphasizes coordinated strategies to develop both technological and human resources to take full advantage of multidisciplinary and translational research opportunities. This proposal addresses the stated training objectives at an individual level.  Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Visual field assessment and optic nerve head imaging (confocal scanning laser tomography) are commonly used to diagnose the disease and monitor its progression, yet there is considerable controversy about how to interpret and make best use of this information. Currently, raw data from these observations are reduced to statistical indices that are meant to summarize clinically meaningful features and provide a basis for classifying test results as normal or not. Unfortunately, these indices may sacrifice other relevant features in the data for interpretability.  We will use mathematical modeling methods (polynomial modeling, spline fitting and wavelet analysis) to quantify patterns in visual field data and topographic images of the optic nerve head. We will use features derived from these modeling methods to apply novel pattern recognition techniques from computer and information sciences-decision trees and non-linear regression analysis-and then compare these techniques to current methods to identify glaucoma. By improving current methods of analysis we can provide a more quantitative basis for clinical decisions, and offer greater consistency and objectivity on data interpretation. The long-term objective of this proposal is to translate advances in computer and information sciences to the analysis of clinical outcomes research in glaucoma and other eye diseases. n/a",Spatial Modeling in Glaucoma,7015012,K23EY016225,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'glaucoma', 'glaucoma test', 'human data', 'image processing', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'neuroimaging', 'optic nerve', 'patient oriented research', 'tomography', 'visual fields']",NEI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K23,2006,142642,-0.046154293972870804
"CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE   The applicant is an Instructor in Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and an associate in bioinformatics and pediatric endocrinology at Children's Hospital, Boston. The applicant completed an NLM-funded fellowship in informatics and received a Masters Degree in Medical Informatics from MIT. Since completing his fellowship less than two years ago, he has first-authored six publications, co-authored eight publications, senior authored two publications, and co-authored a book on microarray analysis. The applicant plans to pursue a career in basic research in diabetes genomics and bioinformatics, with a joint appointment in both an academic pediatric endocrinology department and a medical informatics program. The mentor is Dr. Isaac Kohane, director of the Children's Hospital Informatics Program with a staff of 20 including 10 faculty and extensive computational resources, funded through several NIH grants.       The past 10 years have led to a variety of measurements tools in molecular biology that are near comprehensive in nature. For example, RNA expression detection microarrays can provide systematic quantitative information on the expression of over 40,000 unique RNAs within cells. Yet microarrays are just one of at least 30 large-scale measurement or experimental modalities available to investigators in molecular biology. We see scientific value in being able to integrate multiple large-scale data sets from all biological modalities to address biomedical questions that could otherwise not be answered. We recognize that the full agenda of working out the details for all possible inferential processes between all near-comprehensive modalities is too large. The goal of this project is to serve as a model automated system for gathering data related to particular experimental characteristic and perform inferential operators on these data. For this application, we are focusing on a pragmatic subset. Specifically, we propose intersecting near comprehensive data sets by phenotype, and intersecting lists of significant and related genes within these data sets in an automated manner.      The central hypothesis for this application is that integrating large-scale data sets across measurement  modalities is a synergistic process to create new knowledge and testable hypothesis in the area of diabetes, and inferential processes involving intersection across genes can be automated. n/a",CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE,7007706,K22LM008261,"['RNA interference', 'adipocytes', 'artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'cell differentiation', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diabetes mellitus genetics', 'human data', 'information systems', 'insulin sensitivity /resistance', 'noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus', 'obesity', 'phenotype', 'quantitative trait loci', 'vocabulary', 'weight gain']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K22,2006,153843,-0.0116962993991531
"Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to use neuroinformatics to help resolve the conflicting findings from which two models of olfactory coding have emerged. One model proposes that very many low-specificity neural responses represent each odorant and the other model suggests that fewer, more specific olfactory receptors bind to particular molecular features and that the combination of these specific responses characterizes each odorant. Since much of the data supporting the low-specificity model has been collected without regard for the exquisite spatial heterogeneity of the olfactory system, it is possible that the differences in conclusions could be resolved if the distinct types of data that are collected by various laboratories were placed into spatial register with one another. To that end, we have been building an archive of the spatial patterns of glomerular responses evoked by a wide range of odorants, and we have been able to test hypotheses regarding strategies of olfactory coding by calculating homologies across glomerular-layer response patterns. To facilitate our analytical task, and to make it feasible for others to place their data in register with this odorant response archive, we propose to continue to develop analytical and visualization software for olfactory bulb data. We also propose to extend this approach to both the olfactory epithelium and olfactory cortex to be able to understand both the initial coding and synthetic levels of the olfactory system.  These efforts will be freely available via the web site on which our olfactory activity archive is posted. We propose to improve the site by incorporating meta-data, as well as data from labs using other species and other types of data, such as lesions and neurophysiological data that can be located in space. Finally, the wide range of odorants that we must test to capture a sense of the system also will necessitate the use of an informatics approach to allow us to test hypotheses regarding the complex means by which chemical structure is represented in the system. The combination of these approaches should help resolve the differences between the conflicting models of olfactory coding. n/a",Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding,7068069,R01DC006516,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'bioinformatics', 'chemoreceptors', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'image processing', 'information retrieval', 'laboratory mouse', 'laboratory rat', 'mathematical model', 'meta analysis', 'neural information processing', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'olfactions', 'olfactory lobe', 'olfactory stimulus', 'respiratory epithelium', 'sensory mechanism', 'stimulus /response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE,R01,2006,19532,-0.014302878799391775

"Intelligent Tutor for WMD EMS Incident Management    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop EMS/IM ITS, a suite of simulation-based intelligent tutoring systems and scenarios that will enable practice-based learning of WMD emergency medical services incident management principles and skills, including situation assessment, decision-making, and real-time execution of EMS tasks within an incident command structure. To support practical and economical development of many EMS/IM ITS training scenarios, we will also develop software tools and development methods that enable efficient authoring of new scenarios and adaptation/enhancement of existing scenarios by instructors or subject matter experts, without programming. We will leverage our tutoring system development tools and our experience developing tutoring systems for medical training, command and control, and tactical decision-making. The National Incident Management System (NIMS) was mandated by HSPD-5 to provide a comprehensive, national approach to domestic incident management, so that all levels of government across the nation could work efficiently and effectively together to prepare for, respond to, and recover from domestic incidents. We believe that EMS/IM ITS can contribute to NIMS by providing scenario-based learning of incident management principles for medical first responders, consistent with NIMS, and tailorable via scenario authoring to the specific circumstances and incident management plans of each government organization. This proposed Phase I effort will lay the groundwork for the Phase II effort, by producing 1) requirements and design of the system to be developed during Phase II, 2) a software prototype that illustrates our concept, and 3) a formative evaluation of the prototype and design that provides a basis for estimating the feasibility and effectiveness of the operational system that would be developed during Phase II.             n/a",Intelligent Tutor for WMD EMS Incident Management,7115108,R43ES014801,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'educational resource design /development', 'emergency service /first responder', 'health care personnel education', 'health care professional practice', 'health services research tag', 'medical education', 'method development', 'patient care management', 'training']",NIEHS,"STOTTLER HENKE ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2006,99999,-0.012579953358402734

"Detecting relations among heterogeneous genomic datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past decade, the new focus on genomics has highlighted a particular challenge: to integrate the different views of the genome that are provided by various types of experimental data. The long-term objective of this work is to provide a coherent computational framework for integrating and drawing inferences from a collection of genome-wide measurements. Hence, the proposed research plan develops algorithms and computational tools for learning from heterogeneous data sets. We focus on the analysis of the yeast genome because so many genome-wide data sets are currently available; however, the tools we develop will be applicable to any genome. We approach this task using two recent trends from the field of machine learning: kernel algorithms that represent data via specialized similarity functions, and transductive algorithms that exploit the availability of unlabeled test data during the training phase of the algorithm. We apply focus on two tasks: (1) classifying groups of genes that are of interest to our collaborators, including components of the spindle pole body, cell cycle regulated genes, and genes involved in meiosis and sporulation, splicing, alcohol metabolism, etc., and (2) prediction of protein-protein interactions. These two specific aims are not only important scientific tasks, but also represent typical challenges that future genomic studies will face. Accomplishing these aims requires the integration of many heterogeneous sources of data, the prediction of multiple properties of genes and proteins, the explicit introduction of domain knowledge, the automatic introduction of knowledge from side information, scalability to large data sizes, and tolerance of large levels of noise.         n/a",Detecting relations among heterogeneous genomic datasets,7120160,R33HG003070,"['cell cycle', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection', 'genome', 'informatics', 'meiosis', 'metabolism', 'protein protein interaction']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2006,414036,-0.03846996108854253
"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening. Antibody-based nanopore devices may also serve as highly sensitive immunosensors. n/a",Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions,7119996,K22LM008794,"['antigen antibody reaction', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'intermolecular interaction', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanotechnology', 'pore forming protein', 'protein quantitation /detection']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),K22,2006,162000,-0.04496274541487617
"National Alliance-Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC)(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The National Alliance for Medical Imaging Computing (NAMIC) is a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, software engineers, and medical investigators who develop computational tools for the analysis and visualization of medical image data. The purpose of the center is to provide the infrastructure and environment for the development of computational algorithms and open source technologies, and then oversee the training and dissemination of these tools to the medical research community. This world-class software and development environment serves as a foundation for accelerating the development and deployment of computational tools that are readily accessible to the medical research community. The team combines cutting-edge computer vision research (to create medical imaging analysis algorithms) with state-of-the-art software engineering techniques (based on ""extreme"" programming techniques in a distributed, open-source environment) to enable computational examination of both basic neuroscience and neurological disorders. In developing this infrastructure resource, the team will significantly expand upon proven open systems technology and platforms. The driving biological projects will come initially from the study of schizophrenia, but the methods will be applicable to many other diseases. The computational tools and open systems technologies and platforms developed by NAMIC will initially be used to study anatomical structures and connectivity patterns in the brain, derangements of which have long been thought to play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia. The overall analysis will occur at a range of scales, and will occur across a range of modalities including diffusion MRI, quantitative EGG, and metabolic and receptor PET, but potentially including microscopic, genomic, and other image data. It will apply to image data from individual patients, and to studies executed across large populations.

"Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cochlea is a remarkable sensor: a living cochlea can reliably detect sounds that cause motions of the stapes on the order of picometers, is capable of high-quality frequency analysis (Q10dB > 600), and compresses the large dynamic range (120 dB) of hearing into the considerably smaller dynamic range (20- 50 dB) of neurons. It is now widely accepted that an active mechanical amplification process underlies these remarkable properties. However, there is considerable debate about the nature of the amplifier. While information on the cellular and molecular basis of hearing is increasing rapidly, there is still little understanding of how the components interoperate to generate the remarkable properties of hearing.       To date, the most successful experimental studies of cellular motions in living cochleae have used optical methods. However, current methods, such as laser Doppler vibrometry and video microscopy are limited by the low reflectivities of cochlear structures and the limited optical access provided by the intact cochea. The objective of this grant is to develop and apply a new tomographic imaging and motion measurement technique capable of determining the three-dimensional motions of all structures in a living, intact cochlea. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be used to obtain high-resolution images of the cochlea. Images will be acquired through a narrow opening similar to that used in laser Doppler vibrometry methods, or possibly directly through bone. Sequences of stroboscopic images will be generated with synchronous demodulation of the OCT detector signal during acoustic stimulation. Computer vision algorithms (similar to those used in video microscopy methods) will be used to determine motions with nanometer resolution. This technique will be applied to image and measure three-dimensional motions of the internal microstructure of an intact cochlea, including the basilar membrane, reticular lamina, tectorial membrane, and outer hair cells. n/a",Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions,6985366,R21DC007111,"['animal tissue', 'auditory stimulus', 'biomechanics', 'cochlea', 'computer program /software', 'ear hair cell', 'guinea pigs', 'image processing', 'measurement', 'neuroimaging', 'optical tomography', 'organ of Corti', 'retina', 'technology /technique development', 'three dimensional imaging /topography', 'vibration', 'video microscopy']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2006,183324,-0.023894614456938017
"Nation Center: Multi-Scale Study- Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context. All relevant tools will be made accessible to the biomedical research community through a common, extensible, and interoperable software platform, geWorkbench. We will reach out to train and encourage researchers to use and/or develop new modules for, geWorkbench. An important element of the software platform will be the development of specific components that can exploit the evidence integration techniques developed by Core 9001 investigators to combine molecular interaction clues from Core 9002 algorithms and databases.

"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,7105514,R01GM072740,"['Internet', 'RNA splicing', 'binding sites', 'computational biology', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'genetic regulation', 'messenger RNA', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular shape', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2006,298611,-0.03683923335646692
"Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely believed that crystallization is the rate-limiting step in most X-ray structure determinations. We have therefore been developing computational tools to facilitate this process, including the XtalGrow suite of programs. Here we propose to improve the power and scope of these tools along two fronts: 1. Initial screening, the (iterative) set of experiments that hopefully, yields one or more preliminary ""hits"" (crystalline material that is demonstrably protein); and 2. Optimization experiments that begin with an initial hit and end with diffraction-quality crystals. A central concept of this proposal is that this tool building requires a knowledge-based foundation. Therefore, one of the broad goals of the proposal is to develop a framework for the acquisition and encoding of knowledge in computationally tractable forms; specifically, forms that will yield more effective crystallization procedures. We are interested in how the data interact and how that can be used to improve the crystallization process. While available data, both in the literature and from other projects in the laboratory will continue to be used wherever possible, our analysis has also demonstrated the need to be pro-active i.e. to gather selected data required to complete the knowledge base. We propose to do this by: I. Deepening the data representations is several areas including additional protein characteristics, incorporating a hierarchy of chemical additives and acquiring detailed response data. 11. Improving the efficiency of crystallization screens: Initial crystallization screens would be improved by applying inductive reasoning to the refinement of Bayesian belief nets; procedures would also be developed for dealing with the absence of promising results by identifying unexplored regions of the parameter space and using additional measurements, such as dynamic light scattering and cloud point determinations to further refine the Bayesian belief nets and steer experimentation in more promising directions. Optimization screens would be improved by applying Case-Based and Bayesian methods here as well as by further developments of automated image analysis. III.

"LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The high cost ($0.8 - $1.7 billion) and long time frames (about 13 years) required to introduce new drugs to the market contributes substantially to spiraling health care costs and diseases persisting without effective cures. A major factor is the high attrition rate of new compounds failing due to toxicity identified years into clinical trials. This particular circumstance cost the pharmaceutical industry approximately $8 billion in 2003. In silico tools generally offer the promise of identifying toxicity issues much more rapidly than clinical methods, however, they are not sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical companies to confidently make definitive early screening and related investment decisions. LiverTox is a highly advanced, self-learning liver toxicity prediction tool that represents a quantum leap over current in silico methods. It offers a highly innovative use of multiple analytical approaches to accurately predict the toxicity of candidate Pharmaceuticals in the liver. A differentiating capability is its self-learning computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets. They rapidly assimilate massive volumes of information from LiverTox's extensive, dynamic, and thoroughly reviewed databases. Initially, LiverTox will generate predictions derived from five independent CNN-based submodules; one trained in advanced computational chemistry methods to make quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses; a second trained with microarray data; a third trained with Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing and Gene Expression (MPSS/GE) data; and fourth and fifth submodules trained with proteomics and metabolomics/metabonomics data, respectively. Challenging LiverTox with new chemical formulations triggers the five independent submodules to each make toxicity endpoint predictions drawing upon its knowledge base and its similarity analysis/fuzzy logic/statistical training. This tool's flexible, highly advanced system architecture and advanced learning capabilities using data obtained from diverse techniques enable it to rapidly digest new data, build upon new data acquisition techniques, and use prior lessons learned to achieve overall toxicity predictions with greater than 95% accuracy. LiverTox's ability to rapidly and accurately predict the toxicity of drug candidates will allow pharmaceutical companies to move from discovery to curing disease faster, at greatly reduced cost, and with less reliance on animal-based tests.         n/a",LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction,7052491,R42ES013321,"['artificial intelligence', 'chemical structure function', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug discovery /isolation', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'hepatotoxin', 'microarray technology', 'toxicant screening']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R42,2005,180862,-0.021821101415947813

"BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration& Analysis System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to collaborate with a group of biology researchers with real world needs to develop and distribute a general-purpose system (BioMediator) to permit integration and analysis of diverse types of biologic data. BioMediator will combine information from a variety of different public and private sources (e.g. experimental data) to help answer biologic questions. BioMediator builds on the foundations laid by the currently funded GeneSeek data integration system. The GeneSeek system was originally developed to query only public domain data sources (both structured and semi-structured) to assist in the curation of the GeneClinics genetic testing knowledge base. The specific aims leading to the development of the BioMediator system are: 1) Interface to additional public domain biological data sources (e.g. pathway databases, function databases). 2) Incorporate access to private databases of experimental results (e.g. proteomics and expression array data). 3) Extend model to include analytic tools operating across distributed biological data sources (e.g. across a set of both proteomic and expression array data). 4) Evolve centralized BioMediator system into a model peer to peer data sharing and analysis system. 5) Distribute and maintain BioMediator production software as a resource for the biological community. The health relatedness of the project is that biologists seeking to understand the molecular basis of human health and disease are struggling with large and increasing volumes of diverse data (mutation, expression array, proteomic) that need to be brought together (integrated) and analyzed in order to develop and test hypotheses about disease mechanisms and normal physiology. The research design is to develop BioMediator by combining and leverage recent developments in a) the domain of open source analytic tools for biologic data and b) ongoing theoretical and applied research by members of the current GeneSeek research team on both general purpose and biologic data integration systems. The methods are:  a) to use an iterative rapid prototyping software development model evaluated in a real-world test bed and b) to expand the existing GeneSeek research team (with expertise in informatics, computer science, and software development) to include biological expertise (four biologists forming a biology working group) and biostatistics expertise. The goal is to ensure the BioMediator system 1) meets the needs of a group of end users acquiring, integrating and analyzing diverse biologic data sets, 2) does so in a scaleable and expandable manner drawing on the latest theoretical developments in data analysis and integration. n/a",BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration& Analysis System,6946761,R01HG002288,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2005,100000,0.00671891444194102
"Information Integration of Heterogeneous Data Sources    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to develop an information integration architecture and associated tools to support rapid integration of data and knowledge from distributed heterogeneous data sources. The architecture aims to play a significant role in extracting coherent knowledge bases for biomedical research and improving the accuracy, completeness and quality of the extracted knowledge. Towards achieving these goals, the proposed scalable architecture includes new innovative generalized integration algorithms and tools for the generation of mediators to capture the functional behavior of data sources, semantic representation of data sources to support automated generation of integration agents, and optimization of integrated data queries. The information integration architecture keeps pace with the evolving Internet-based XML electronic data interchange, semantic web services, and web services discovery standards. Thus, leveraging the Internet technologies and standards for the purpose of providing lasting state-of-the-art solutions for information integration. In addition, the proposed architecture is inherently scalable in terms of the number of data sources that can be integrated, the number of users of the integrated system, and the range of biomedical problems that can be tackled. During phase I of the project, prototypes of the proposed integration algorithms and tools will be developed as proofs of concept and to form the foundation for evaluation and pilot testing of the proposed integration mechanisms, using private and public data sources, in terms of scalability and integration capabilities.         n/a",Information Integration of Heterogeneous Data Sources,6881960,R43RR018667,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'information retrieval', 'information system analysis', 'information systems', 'mathematics']",NCRR,"INFOTECH SOFT, INC.",R43,2005,260661,-0.012593384824887885
"Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This training proposal describes a research plan which tests the application of a computer science solution to a clinical problem encountered by nurse practitioners (NPs). As our understanding of genetics health increases, NPs will need to provide care and create health promotion regimens mindful of each client's genetic profile. Access to the rapidly developing genetics health literature is critical for this practice model, but may be difficult, because existing search methods lead to many irrelevant results, and may retrieve the proper result only when precise keywords are used. The NP searching for information that would guide her practice may be forced to make a decision with less than complete or current information. This proposal outlines three studies, which investigate how the semantic web concepts of linking related ideas and terms can improve NPs' access to the genetics health literature. Study 1 explores NPs' genetics health information needs. Study 2 tests the applicability of existing ontologies (terminologies coupled with machine-readable statements about the meanings and relationships of the terms) to nursing. Study 3 tests a prototype intelligent agent employing ontology to retrieve literature relevant to NPs' genetics health information needs.         n/a",Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature,6955060,F37LM008636,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'genetics', 'human subject', 'informatics', 'information retrieval', 'nurse practitioners', 'patient care management', 'predoctoral investigator', 'publications', 'semantics', 'young adult human (21-34)']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,F37,2005,39150,-0.022472738185467963
"Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Inter-observer variability in mammogram reading has been well documented in the literature. Various factors have been used to explain this variability; among them, the most significant are related to the management of perceived findings.  However, the nature of this inter-observer variability has not been explored. Namely, were the lesions that were consistently reported by the radiologists any different from the ones that yield disagreement? Furthermore, could these differences be quantitatively assessed? Moreover, were these differences in any way related with the experience level of the observer? In addition, the interpretation of perceived findings is closely related with the visual search strategy used to scan the breast tissue, because observers compare perceived findings with the background, in order to determine their uniqueness. Hence, what is the effect of visual search strategy on inter-observer variability? Can this effect be modeled using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)? Can inferences be made regarding the observers' decision patterns by analyzing the results of simulations run on the ANNs?  The work described here aims at answering these questions. We will use spatial frequency analysis to characterize the areas on mammogram cases where mammographers, chest radiologists with experience reading mammograms and radiology residents at the end of their mammography rotation, indicate the presence of a finding, or fail to do so. We will assess inter-observer agreement, as well as intra- and inter-group agreement for the various groups of observers. In addition, we will train artificial neural networks to represent each observer, in such a way that by changing the nature of the features input to the ANNs we will be able to simulate how such changes would have affected the actual observer. We will assess the effects on inter-observer variability of changing the search strategy used by the observer to sample the breast tissue. In our setting, the inter-observer variability will be assessed by comparing the outputs of the ANNs that represent each observer. In addition, the changes in sampling strategy will correspond to actual possible strategies for the human observers themselves. n/a",Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography,6924688,R21CA100107,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'human data', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mammography', 'visual perception']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2005,167063,-0.04173247733663487
"Neural network model of noise-induced hearing loss DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the proposed work is to develop a prediction model using radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) that will predict the auditory consequences of excessive noise exposure in a chinchilla model. The RBFNN model will be fed training data from our existing database (chinchilla) consisting of noise exposure metrics and audiometric/histological/otoacoustic emission data acquired from previously exposed animals. Once trained, the model will be able to predict the auditory consequences of exposure to any noise environment characterized by ten noise metrics and five biological variables of the animals that are input to the model. There are two phases to this research. The first phase is the design of the system structure and implementation software (Year 1). The second phase involves training the system using an extensive database consisting of more than 2500 subjects on which comprehensive exposure and audiometric/histological data are available (Year 2). The training period will be an iterative process in which the RBFNN will be modified as training proceeds. The prediction model can also be used to design experimental conditions from which the model can be experimentally tested. The successful demonstration of the application of a RBFNN to the prediction of noise-induced auditory effects has considerable potential for application to the assessment of industrial and military noise environments for the protection of hearing in humans, and can result in a considerable savings in the amount of work/resources that are needed to develop new and improved noise standards. Specifically, given the many similarities in the response to noise of the chinchilla and the human, the model can be used to identify combinations of parameters of an exposure that are important determinants of damage that would also be applicable to human exposure conditions. The chinchilla model can be used as a template or a guide for developing a human model possibly from some of the existing human data from which current standards were developed. n/a",Neural network model of noise-induced hearing loss,6941215,R03OH008175,"['artificial intelligence', 'chinchilla', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'disease /disorder model', 'environmental exposure', 'model design /development', 'noise biological effect', 'noise induced deafness']",NIOSH,PLATTSBURGH STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2005,71735,-0.01107744750997
"Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): KIT Solutions, a private firm specializing in developing intelligent, Knowledge-based Information Technology (KIT) solutions for the field of health and human services will partner with the University of Pittsburgh, Office of Child Development (OCD) to develop a Web-based, interactive software application of a Family Support Management Information System (FS MIS) for nationwide dissemination. This innovation is called Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT).  Family support centers, like other human service programs and agencies across the country, are being required to implement best practices and document the impact of their services to funders, policy makers, and the community. However, most family centers do not have a state-of-the-art web-based information system available to them that integrates best practice, expert knowledge, and daily management functions. The proposed LIFT system will address these critical needs and has great potential for nationwide commercial distribution. The combination of KIT'S proven record of developing knowledge based information technology and OCD's over 20 years of research and practice in family support services will greatly enhances the chance of success for this business venture. In Phase I of the project, we will produce prototype software demonstrating the benefit, usability, and feasibility of a web-based, interactive, intelligent system for use by family support centers across the nation. The extent of which LIFT enables family center staff to build skill, capacity, access information and expert knowledge, to enhance their work will be the focus of this phase. In Phase II, we will fully develop the prototype LIFT to a commercial grade web application for nationwide dissemination and further validate the commercial potential and impact of LIFT, using a quasiexperimental design, which will involve a large number of users across multiple sites. In Phase III, we will seek private funding for marketing the system to the national market. We intend to use the Microsoft.Net Platform and follow XML web service concepts to develop the proposed innovation. Collection of a subscription fee will be used to support the maintenance and future development of the system. n/a","Linking Information, Families and Technology (LIFT)",6990440,R43HD049229,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'family', 'focus groups', 'human subject', 'information dissemination', 'social service']",NICHD,"KIT SOLUTIONS, INC.",R43,2005,104545,-0.007811208786289132
"Simulation Algorithms for Spatial Pattern Recognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This SBIR project is developing methods and software for the specification, construction and simulation of neutral spatial models, and for applying these neutral models within the framework of probabilistic pattern recognition. Results will allow epidemiologists, environmental scientists and image analysts across a broad range of commercial disciplines to more accurately identify patterns in spatial data by removing the bias towards false positives that is caused by unrealistic null hypotheses such as ""complete spatial randomness"" (CSR). This project will accomplish 5 aims:      1. Conduct a requirements analysis to specify the neutral models and functionality to incorporate in the software.   2. Develop and test a software prototype to evaluate feasibility of the proposed models.   3. Propose a topology of neutral models and develop strategies to generate them and to conduct sensitivity analysis for investigating the impact of implicit assumptions (i.e. spatial autocorrelation or non-uniform risk) and number of realizations on test results.   4. Incorporate the neutral models in the first commercially established software package that allows for user-specified alternate hypothesis in spatial statistical tests.   5. Apply the software and methods to demonstrate the approach and its unique benefits for exposure and health risk assessment.      Feasibility of this project was demonstrated in the Phase I. This Phase II project will accomplish aims three through five. These technologic, scientific and commercial innovations will revolutionize our ability to identify, document and assess the probability of spatial patterns relative to neutral models that incorporate realistic local, spatial and multivariate dependencies.

"Shifting Conceptions of Human Identity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  . One of the most important questions raised by the ongoing achievements of the Human Genome Project is how this new biological knowledge - and the powers it confers - will affect our identity and self-understanding as human beings. This book project focuses on one key aspect of this complex issue: exploring the extent to which human identity can be reconciled with deliberate design or partial redesign. The author proposes to shed new light on this question by comparing the debates surrounding two areas of scientific innovation that are not normally associated with each other, but that are in fact deeply related: the enterprise of human genetic intervention and the enterprise of building intelligent machines. Both these enterprises entail ""pushing the limits"" of traditional concepts of what it means to be human; and both ultimately confront their makers with the same core ""family"" of questions: What are the defining features of human personhood? To what extent can those features be modified or extended, before human personhood begins to break down? Can some (or all) of those features find embodiment in an entity other than a human being? These kinds of questions are no longer the sole province of science fiction writers, but have been taken up with increasing seriousness by mainstream scientists and technologists, as well as by a wide array of ""science watchers"" in academia, legislative circles, and the news media.   . Through documentary research and interviews, this project aims to deepen our understanding of the history and sociology of the debates surrounding these powerful new technologies, electro-mechanical and biological, that are perceived as destabilizing human identity. The intended audience for the book is a broad one: scientists and technological practitioners interested in the social and cultural reception of their research; legislators and other policymakers with a stake in the governance of science; general educated readers who are concerned about the role of science and technology in shaping our collective future. n/a",Shifting Conceptions of Human Identity,6915830,R03HG003298,"['adult human (21+)', 'artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'biotechnology', 'books', 'clinical research', 'ethics', 'genetic manipulation', 'history of life science', 'human subject', 'identity', 'interview', 'robotics', 'self concept', 'sociology /anthropology']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R03,2005,75833,-0.03366076935320958

"Multi-microphone long probe for OAE acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of an innovative multi-microphone probe and acquisition system for recording otoacoustic emissions {OAEs} with advanced noise cancellation algorithms, increased frequency and intensity ranges and pressurization capabilities is proposed. Two advanced noise cancellation algorithm will be implemented: 1) a multi-reference adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) network and 2) two-dimensional filtering. These algorithms will utilize the independent measurements provided by the multiple microphones in order to reduce noise contaminants. Each microphone or microphone groupings will be connected to individual analog-to-digital (A/D) converters in order to allow for the implementation of the digital signal processing algorithms. The pressurization capabilities of the probe will allow implementation of tympanometry and the acquisition of OAEs while compensating for pressure imbalances between the outer and middle ear. Results from a prototype single microphone long probe are presented demonstrating that the design concept is valid and provides good quality OAE recordings while reducing the undesirable effects of the metal response. The proposed probe will also improve upon the limited dynamic and frequency range of current OAE probes. The probe is expected to be able to provide stimulus levels of up to 90 dB HL and a frequency response of up to 24 kHz. During Phase I, various probes will be constructed and tested under different noise conditions in adult and infant subjects. During Phase II, the pressurization capabilities of the new probe will be further developed and examined.

"Multi-Agent Collaboration for AMD Subtype Classification  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in developed countries and as such represents a very significant public health problem a number of specific genes, and the discovery, characterization, and eventual therapeutic control of these genes represent major goals of the vision research community. Although the strategies for gene discovery have become very powerful in recent years, there remains a major obstacle to the discovery of genes that underlie common, late-onset diseases like AMD. That obstacle is that clinicians cannot reliably sort patients with different molecular subtypes of late-onset disease into sufficiently homogeneous groups. The purpose of this project is to use the power of multi-agent systems computer technology in a novel way to aid clinicians in the collaborative development of a robust classification system based upon the ophthalmoscopic features of AMD. The result of this project will contribute to an NIH's Innovations in Biomedical Information and Science and Technology Program goal of speeding the progress of biomedical research through the development tools for electronic collaboration that will have impact on broader areas of biomedical research.   We hypothesize that a multi-agent approach to this problem will result in a classification system with greater reproducibility and discriminative power than a system developed by clinicians without such computer assistance. The availability of populations of AMD patients with lower molecular complexity will significantly increase the power of statistical techniques for AMD gene discovery. In addition to this immediate and specific benefit, the strategies we will develop during this project for objectively interfacing medical experts with each other as well as with computers will have applications in the search for other late-onset disease genes as well as in the development of multi-center and multidisciplinary clinical trials of new therapeutic approaches. The proposed system, the Intelligent Distributed Ontology Consensus system (IDOCS) goes beyond conventional groupware by addressing drawbacks to direct, synchronous interaction by providing an autonomously coordinated, asynchronous interaction and collaboration platform among clinicians through their representative intelligent agents.

"Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The elaboration of the sequences of the human genome and those of many cellular and viral parasites has given us an unprecedented opportunity to address the causes and treatment of every major human disease. It has also resulted in the formation of an entirely new field, bioinformatics, which promises to manage and analyze the vast amount of data being generated. Bioinformatics needs to supply tools for data analysis and tools for experimental design. Most of the scientific and corporate resources being expended in bioinformatics are being spent on data analysis tools. While these are essential, we should not neglect the opportunity to accelerate the progress of actual experimental biology. Essentially every experiment in biology now begins with cloning one or more pieces of DNA. Commercial software that facilitates virtual DNA cloning does exist, but it lacks any automation features and depends on primitive and/or fragmentary gene and vector databases. It is inadequate in planning the hundreds or thousands of clones necessary to address questions posed by the proteomics initiatives, because the lack of knowledge integration. In Phase I of this SBIR grant, we have built and tested a virtual cloning expert system, along with a very useful gene database and a uniquely annotated vector database that serve as a knowledge base for automated DNA manipulations. A collection of automated cloning modules and databases is now functional. In Phase II we will complete the virtual cloning expert system and develop a flexible platform for automated experimental design, data management and analysis. We will also construct a user database, improve the user interface and establish security protocols.

"Spatial Modeling in Glaucoma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career training proposal is to train Michael D. Twa, OD, MS as an independent clinician-scientist. A five year training program is proposed, consisting of formal coursework in vision science, specific training in computer science and image processing, and mentoring in the application of these skills to clinical outcomes research in glaucoma. In September 2003, NIH announced a new ""Roadmap"" to accelerate advances in biomedical research for the 21st century. Three areas listed in this Roadmap are relevant to this research proposal: (1) Interdisciplinary research training. (2) Clinical research informatics. (3) Development of enabling technologies for improved assessment of clinical outcomes. The Roadmap emphasizes coordinated strategies to develop both technological and human resources to take full advantage of multidisciplinary and translational research opportunities. This proposal addresses the stated training objectives at an individual level.  Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. Visual field assessment and optic nerve head imaging (confocal scanning laser tomography) are commonly used to diagnose the disease and monitor its progression, yet there is considerable controversy about how to interpret and make best use of this information. Currently, raw data from these observations are reduced to statistical indices that are meant to summarize clinically meaningful features and provide a basis for classifying test results as normal or not. Unfortunately, these indices may sacrifice other relevant features in the data for interpretability.  We will use mathematical modeling methods (polynomial modeling, spline fitting and wavelet analysis) to quantify patterns in visual field data and topographic images of the optic nerve head. We will use features derived from these modeling methods to apply novel pattern recognition techniques from computer and information sciences-decision trees and non-linear regression analysis-and then compare these techniques to current methods to identify glaucoma. By improving current methods of analysis we can provide a more quantitative basis for clinical decisions, and offer greater consistency and objectivity on data interpretation. The long-term objective of this proposal is to translate advances in computer and information sciences to the analysis of clinical outcomes research in glaucoma and other eye diseases. n/a",Spatial Modeling in Glaucoma,6863529,K23EY016225,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'glaucoma', 'glaucoma test', 'human data', 'image processing', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'neuroimaging', 'optic nerve', 'patient oriented research', 'tomography', 'visual fields']",NEI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K23,2005,143096,-0.046154293972870804

For example, RNA expression detection microarrays can provide systematic quantitative information on the expression of over 40,000 unique RNAs within cells. Yet microarrays are just one of at least 30 large-scale measurement or experimental modalities available to investigators in molecular biology. We see scientific value in being able to integrate multiple large-scale data sets from all biological modalities to address biomedical questions that could otherwise not be answered. We recognize that the full agenda of working out the details for all possible inferential processes between all near-comprehensive modalities is too large. The goal of this project is to serve as a model automated system for gathering data related to particular experimental characteristic and perform inferential operators on these data. For this application, we are focusing on a pragmatic subset. Specifically, we propose intersecting near comprehensive data sets by phenotype, and intersecting lists of significant and related genes within these data sets in an automated manner.      The central hypothesis for this application is that integrating large-scale data sets across measurement  modalities is a synergistic process to create new knowledge and testable hypothesis in the area of diabetes, and inferential processes involving intersection across genes can be automated. n/a",CREATION AND APPLICATION OF A DIABETES KNOWLEDGE BASE,7125331,K22LM008261,"['RNA interference', 'adipocytes', 'artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'cell differentiation', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diabetes mellitus genetics', 'human data', 'information systems', 'insulin sensitivity /resistance', 'noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus', 'obesity', 'phenotype', 'quantitative trait loci', 'vocabulary', 'weight gain']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K22,2005,152083,-0.0116962993991531
"Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to use neuroinformatics to help resolve the conflicting findings from which two models of olfactory coding have emerged. One model proposes that very many low-specificity neural responses represent each odorant and the other model suggests that fewer, more specific olfactory receptors bind to particular molecular features and that the combination of these specific responses characterizes each odorant. Since much of the data supporting the low-specificity model has been collected without regard for the exquisite spatial heterogeneity of the olfactory system, it is possible that the differences in conclusions could be resolved if the distinct types of data that are collected by various laboratories were placed into spatial register with one another. To that end, we have been building an archive of the spatial patterns of glomerular responses evoked by a wide range of odorants, and we have been able to test hypotheses regarding strategies of olfactory coding by calculating homologies across glomerular-layer response patterns. To facilitate our analytical task, and to make it feasible for others to place their data in register with this odorant response archive, we propose to continue to develop analytical and visualization software for olfactory bulb data. We also propose to extend this approach to both the olfactory epithelium and olfactory cortex to be able to understand both the initial coding and synthetic levels of the olfactory system.  These efforts will be freely available via the web site on which our olfactory activity archive is posted. We propose to improve the site by incorporating meta-data, as well as data from labs using other species and other types of data, such as lesions and neurophysiological data that can be located in space. Finally, the wide range of odorants that we must test to capture a sense of the system also will necessitate the use of an informatics approach to allow us to test hypotheses regarding the complex means by which chemical structure is represented in the system. The combination of these approaches should help resolve the differences between the conflicting models of olfactory coding. n/a",Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding,6937143,R01DC006516,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'bioinformatics', 'chemoreceptors', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'image processing', 'information retrieval', 'laboratory mouse', 'laboratory rat', 'mathematical model', 'meta analysis', 'neural information processing', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'olfactions', 'olfactory lobe', 'olfactory stimulus', 'respiratory epithelium', 'sensory mechanism', 'stimulus /response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE,R01,2005,20000,-0.014302878799391775
"Vortex Tubed Thermocycler with Intelligent Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A novel system is proposed for the rapid identification of DNA. The system comprises of a unique thermocycler platform built around the extraordinary vortex tube, detection optics, intelligent software to provide users with information on most ideal operating conditions, and virtual insight into the PCR process as it progresses. An intelligent user interface will allow DNA amplification/detection on an unprecedented timescale (less than 10 minutes). A multi-disciplinary team that consists of a chemical engineer, a mechanical engineer, and two biochemists has been assembled for this project. The efficiency of the vortex tube will be optimized by the use of computational fluid dynamics. Heat transfer between the gas phase and the cuvets will be improved through computational fluid dynamic calculations. The intelligent software consists of a detailed mathematical model that uses similar starting conditions as the initial cuvet composition to model the amplification progress and it performs a virtual PCR in parallel with the actual process. The virtual PCR will become a quantitative tool point-of-care diagnosis of a wide variety of heritable and infectious diseases.

"Model for prediction of noise-induced hearing loss DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the proposed work is to develop a prediction model using a statistical learning machine (SLM), which includes an artificial neural network (ANN), a support vector machine (SVM), and a hybrid of ANN and SVM, that will predict the auditory consequences of excessive noise exposure in a chinchilla model. The SLM model will be fed training data from our existing database consisting of noise exposure metrics and audiometric/histological/otoacoustic emission data acquired from previously exposed animals.  Once trained, the SLM model will be able to predict the auditory consequences of exposure to any noise environment characterized by the noise metrics and biological variables of the animals that are input to the model. There are two phases to this research. The first phase is the design of the system structure and implementation software (Year 1). The second phase involves training the system using an extensive database consisting of more than 2500 subjects on which comprehensive exposure and audiometric/ histological data are available (Year 2). The training period will be an iterative process in which the SLM will be modified as training proceeds. The predictions of the SLM model can also be used to design experimental conditions from which the model can be experimentally tested. The successful demonstration of the application of a statistical learning machine to the prediction of noise-induced auditory effects has considerable potential for application to the assessment of industrial and military noise environments for the protection of hearing in humans, and can result in a considerable savings in the amount of work/resources that are needed to develop new and improved noise standards. Specifically, given the many similarities in the response to noise of the chinchilla and the human, the model can be used to identify combinations of parameters of an exposure that are important determinants of damage that would also be applicable to human exposure conditions. The chinchilla model can be used as a template or a guide for developing a human model possibly from some of the existing human data from which current standards were developed. n/a",Model for prediction of noise-induced hearing loss,6878561,R01OH007801,"['chinchilla', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'noise induced deafness', 'noise pollution']",NIOSH,PLATTSBURGH STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,139799,-0.009083563953085804

"Detecting relations among heterogeneous genomic datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past decade, the new focus on genomics has highlighted a particular challenge: to integrate the different views of the genome that are provided by various types of experimental data. The long-term objective of this work is to provide a coherent computational framework for integrating and drawing inferences from a collection of genome-wide measurements. Hence, the proposed research plan develops algorithms and computational tools for learning from heterogeneous data sets. We focus on the analysis of the yeast genome because so many genome-wide data sets are currently available; however, the tools we develop will be applicable to any genome. We approach this task using two recent trends from the field of machine learning: kernel algorithms that represent data via specialized similarity functions, and transductive algorithms that exploit the availability of unlabeled test data during the training phase of the algorithm. We apply focus on two tasks: (1) classifying groups of genes that are of interest to our collaborators, including components of the spindle pole body, cell cycle regulated genes, and genes involved in meiosis and sporulation, splicing, alcohol metabolism, etc., and (2) prediction of protein-protein interactions. These two specific aims are not only important scientific tasks, but also represent typical challenges that future genomic studies will face. Accomplishing these aims requires the integration of many heterogeneous sources of data, the prediction of multiple properties of genes and proteins, the explicit introduction of domain knowledge, the automatic introduction of knowledge from side information, scalability to large data sizes, and tolerance of large levels of noise.         n/a",Detecting relations among heterogeneous genomic datasets,6952028,R33HG003070,"['cell cycle', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection', 'genome', 'informatics', 'meiosis', 'metabolism', 'protein protein interaction']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2005,412000,-0.03846996108854253
"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening. Antibody-based nanopore devices may also serve as highly sensitive immunosensors. n/a",Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions,6959048,K22LM008794,"['antigen antibody reaction', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'intermolecular interaction', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanotechnology', 'pore forming protein', 'protein quantitation /detection']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),K22,2005,162000,-0.04496274541487617

The purpose of the center is to provide the infrastructure and environment for the development of computational algorithms and open source technologies, and then oversee the training and dissemination of these tools to the medical research community. This world-class software and development environment serves as a foundation for accelerating the development and deployment of computational tools that are readily accessible to the medical research community.

"Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cochlea is a remarkable sensor: a living cochlea can reliably detect sounds that cause motions of the stapes on the order of picometers, is capable of high-quality frequency analysis (Q10dB > 600), and compresses the large dynamic range (120 dB) of hearing into the considerably smaller dynamic range (20- 50 dB) of neurons. It is now widely accepted that an active mechanical amplification process underlies these remarkable properties. However, there is considerable debate about the nature of the amplifier. While information on the cellular and molecular basis of hearing is increasing rapidly, there is still little understanding of how the components interoperate to generate the remarkable properties of hearing.       To date, the most successful experimental studies of cellular motions in living cochleae have used optical methods. However, current methods, such as laser Doppler vibrometry and video microscopy are limited by the low reflectivities of cochlear structures and the limited optical access provided by the intact cochea. The objective of this grant is to develop and apply a new tomographic imaging and motion measurement technique capable of determining the three-dimensional motions of all structures in a living, intact cochlea. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be used to obtain high-resolution images of the cochlea. Images will be acquired through a narrow opening similar to that used in laser Doppler vibrometry methods, or possibly directly through bone. Sequences of stroboscopic images will be generated with synchronous demodulation of the OCT detector signal during acoustic stimulation. Computer vision algorithms (similar to those used in video microscopy methods) will be used to determine motions with nanometer resolution. This technique will be applied to image and measure three-dimensional motions of the internal microstructure of an intact cochlea, including the basilar membrane, reticular lamina, tectorial membrane, and outer hair cells. n/a",Tomographic Imaging of Cochlear Micromechanical Motions,6850297,R21DC007111,"['animal tissue', 'auditory stimulus', 'biomechanics', 'cochlea', 'computer program /software', 'ear hair cell', 'guinea pigs', 'image processing', 'measurement', 'neuroimaging', 'optical tomography', 'organ of Corti', 'retina', 'technology /technique development', 'three dimensional imaging /topography', 'vibration', 'video microscopy']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2005,172385,-0.023894614456938017
"Nation Center: Multi-Scale Study- Cellular Networks(RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A network of molecular interactions, involving many thousands of genes, their products, and other molecules, underlie cellular processes. Investigation of these interactions across a wide range of scales ranging from the formation/activation of transcriptional complexes, to the availability of a signaling pathway, all the way to macroscopic processes, such as cell adhesion, calls for a new level of sophistication in the design of genome- wide computational approaches. A homogeneous environment for the comprehensive mapping and analysis of molecular cellular interactions in would be a powerful resource for the biomedical research community. We propose the creation of a National Center for the Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet). The Center will provide an integrative computational framework to organize molecular interactions in the cell into manageable context-dependent components and will develop interoperable computational models and tools that can leverage such a map of cellular interactions to elucidate important biological processes. Center activities will involve a significant, multidisciplinary effort of biological and computational sciences. Specific areas of expertise include natural language parsing (NLP), machine learning (ML), software systems and engineering, databases, computational structural biology, reverse engineering of genetic networks, biomedical literature datamining, and biomedical ontologies, among others. The Center will 1) construct an evidence integration framework to collect and fuse a variety of diverse cellular interaction clues based on their statistical relevance 2) assemble a comprehensive set of physics- and knowledge-based methodologies to fill this framework 3) provide a set of methodologies and filters, anchored in formal domain ontologies, to associated specific interactions to an organism, tissue, molecular, and cellular context.

"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,6966860,R01GM072740,"['Internet', 'RNA splicing', 'binding sites', 'computational biology', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'genetic regulation', 'messenger RNA', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular shape', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2005,304845,-0.03683923335646692
"Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely believed that crystallization is the rate-limiting step in most X-ray structure determinations. We have therefore been developing computational tools to facilitate this process, including the XtalGrow suite of programs. Here we propose to improve the power and scope of these tools along two fronts: 1. Initial screening, the (iterative) set of experiments that hopefully, yields one or more preliminary ""hits"" (crystalline material that is demonstrably protein); and 2. Optimization experiments that begin with an initial hit and end with diffraction-quality crystals. A central concept of this proposal is that this tool building requires a knowledge-based foundation. Therefore, one of the broad goals of the proposal is to develop a framework for the acquisition and encoding of knowledge in computationally tractable forms; specifically, forms that will yield more effective crystallization procedures. We are interested in how the data interact and how that can be used to improve the crystallization process. While available data, both in the literature and from other projects in the laboratory will continue to be used wherever possible, our analysis has also demonstrated the need to be pro-active i.e. to gather selected data required to complete the knowledge base. We propose to do this by: I. Deepening the data representations is several areas including additional protein characteristics, incorporating a hierarchy of chemical additives and acquiring detailed response data. 11. Improving the efficiency of crystallization screens: Initial crystallization screens would be improved by applying inductive reasoning to the refinement of Bayesian belief nets; procedures would also be developed for dealing with the absence of promising results by identifying unexplored regions of the parameter space and using additional measurements, such as dynamic light scattering and cloud point determinations to further refine the Bayesian belief nets and steer experimentation in more promising directions. Optimization screens would be improved by applying Case-Based and Bayesian methods here as well as by further developments of automated image analysis. III.

"LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stottler Henke Associates in collaboration with Teachers College, Columbia University, proposes to build a software system for teaching scientific inquiry in the context of nutrition science, The goal of the proposed research is to develop a computer based instructional system - called LiFESim - that teaches accurate and detailed information about food and the food system -- from production of food on the farm through food processing and transportation, to impacts of food on personal health and on the natural environment in terms of waste and pollution. The software will complement an existing health science curriculum, developed at Teachers College for 4th-6th graders, called ""Linking Food and the Environment"" or LIFE, developed from an NIH Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) RR 12374 (1997-2004). Our system will be based on the paradigm of role-playing simulation used in such popular computer games as SimCity and The Sims: students using the software assume roles in a simulated environment and learn from the consequences of the decisions that they make in those roles. Using the simulation paradigm students will be able to explore the dynamics of large-scale systems, such as those the food transportation system in ways that are not possible with the existing curriculum. For example, the simulation would allow students to explore the impact of changes in transportation patterns on food delivery. Our system will provide explicit coaching in applying scientific methods for investigation. We will also explore learning strategies that will encourage students to critically examine - and hopefully improve - their dietary choices. We will complement simulation-based learning with two other artificial intelligence based methodologies - the use of lifelike pedagogical agents, and the use of case-based reasoning. During Phase I, we will develop a set of detailed instructional goals, use these to develop an initial system design, develop a limited prototype of the system, and then develop and perform an informal pilot study to evaluate the viability of our design. The pilot study will be conducted over a one-month period at schools in Hayward, California and New York City. Our Phase II effort will focus on developing an extensive design and performing detailed use testing of the system developed during Phase I.         n/a",LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR),6790401,R43RR019780,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'environmental contamination', 'food', 'food processing /preparation', 'health education', 'human subject', 'interactive multimedia', 'nutrition', 'nutrition related tag', 'science education']",NCRR,"STOTTLER HENKE ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2004,100000,-0.03615445254074921
"BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration& Analysis System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to collaborate with a group of biology researchers with real world needs to develop and distribute a general-purpose system (BioMediator) to permit integration and analysis of diverse types of biologic data. BioMediator will combine information from a variety of different public and private sources (e.g. experimental data) to help answer biologic questions. BioMediator builds on the foundations laid by the currently funded GeneSeek data integration system. The GeneSeek system was originally developed to query only public domain data sources (both structured and semi-structured) to assist in the curation of the GeneClinics genetic testing knowledge base. The specific aims leading to the development of the BioMediator system are: 1) Interface to additional public domain biological data sources (e.g. pathway databases, function databases). 2) Incorporate access to private databases of experimental results (e.g. proteomics and expression array data). 3) Extend model to include analytic tools operating across distributed biological data sources (e.g. across a set of both proteomic and expression array data). 4) Evolve centralized BioMediator system into a model peer to peer data sharing and analysis system. 5) Distribute and maintain BioMediator production software as a resource for the biological community. The health relatedness of the project is that biologists seeking to understand the molecular basis of human health and disease are struggling with large and increasing volumes of diverse data (mutation, expression array, proteomic) that need to be brought together (integrated) and analyzed in order to develop and test hypotheses about disease mechanisms and normal physiology. The research design is to develop BioMediator by combining and leverage recent developments in a) the domain of open source analytic tools for biologic data and b) ongoing theoretical and applied research by members of the current GeneSeek research team on both general purpose and biologic data integration systems. The methods are:  a) to use an iterative rapid prototyping software development model evaluated in a real-world test bed and b) to expand the existing GeneSeek research team (with expertise in informatics, computer science, and software development) to include biological expertise (four biologists forming a biology working group) and biostatistics expertise. The goal is to ensure the BioMediator system 1) meets the needs of a group of end users acquiring, integrating and analyzing diverse biologic data sets, 2) does so in a scaleable and expandable manner drawing on the latest theoretical developments in data analysis and integration. n/a",BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration& Analysis System,6805962,R01HG002288,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2004,100000,0.00671891444194102
"Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Exact Logistic Regression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today, software for fitting logistic regression models to binary data belongs in the toolkit of every professional biostatistician, epidemiologist, and social scientist. A natural follow-up to this development is the adoption of exact logistic regression by mainstream biostatisticians and data analysts for any setting in which the accuracy of a statistical analysis based on large-sample maximum likelihood theory is in doubt. Cutting-edge researchers in biometry and numerous other fields have already recognized that it is necessary to supplement inference based on large-sample methods with exact inference for small, sparse and unbalanced data. The LogXact software package developed by Cytel Software Corporation fills this need. It has been used since its inception in 1993 to produce exact inferences for data generated from a wide range fields including clinical trials, epidemiology, disease surveillance, insurance, criminology, finance, accounting, sociology and ecology. In all these applications exact logistic regression was adopted because the limitations of the corresponding asymptotic procedures were clearly recognized in advance by the investigators and the exact inference was computationally feasible. But most of the time it will not be obvious whether asymptotic or exact methods are applicable. Ideally one would prefer to run both types of analyses if there is any doubt about the appropriateness of the asymptotic inference. However, because of the computational limits of the exact algorithms, investigators are currently inhibited from attempting the exact analysis. There is uncertainty about the how long the computations will take and even whether they will produce any results at all before the computer runs out of memory. The current project eliminates this uncertainty by introducing a new generation of numerical algorithms that utilize network based Monte Carlo rejection sampling. The Phase 1 progress report has demonstrated that these new algorithms can speed up the computations by factors of 50 to 1000 relative to what is currently available in LogXact. More importantly they can predict how long a job will take so that the user may decide whether to proceed at once or at a better time. The Phase 2 effort aims to incorporate this new generation of computing algorithms into future versions of LogXact.         n/a",Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Exact Logistic Regression,6703756,R44CA093112,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'human data', 'mathematical model', 'mathematics', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,"CYTEL, INC",R44,2004,411387,0.004998324525814063
"Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This training proposal describes a research plan which tests the application of a computer science solution to a clinical problem encountered by nurse practitioners (NPs). As our understanding of genetics health increases, NPs will need to provide care and create health promotion regimens mindful of each client's genetic profile. Access to the rapidly developing genetics health literature is critical for this practice model, but may be difficult, because existing search methods lead to many irrelevant results, and may retrieve the proper result only when precise keywords are used. The NP searching for information that would guide her practice may be forced to make a decision with less than complete or current information. This proposal outlines three studies, which investigate how the semantic web concepts of linking related ideas and terms can improve NPs' access to the genetics health literature. Study 1 explores NPs' genetics health information needs. Study 2 tests the applicability of existing ontologies (terminologies coupled with machine-readable statements about the meanings and relationships of the terms) to nursing. Study 3 tests a prototype intelligent agent employing ontology to retrieve literature relevant to NPs' genetics health information needs.         n/a",Nurse Practitioner Access to Genetics Health Literature,6837265,F37LM008636,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'genetics', 'human subject', 'informatics', 'information retrieval', 'nurse practitioners', 'patient care management', 'predoctoral investigator', 'publications', 'semantics', 'young adult human (21-34)']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,F37,2004,38596,-0.022472738185467963
"Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Inter-observer variability in mammogram reading has been well documented in the literature. Various factors have been used to explain this variability; among them, the most significant are related to the management of perceived findings.  However, the nature of this inter-observer variability has not been explored. Namely, were the lesions that were consistently reported by the radiologists any different from the ones that yield disagreement? Furthermore, could these differences be quantitatively assessed? Moreover, were these differences in any way related with the experience level of the observer? In addition, the interpretation of perceived findings is closely related with the visual search strategy used to scan the breast tissue, because observers compare perceived findings with the background, in order to determine their uniqueness. Hence, what is the effect of visual search strategy on inter-observer variability? Can this effect be modeled using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)? Can inferences be made regarding the observers' decision patterns by analyzing the results of simulations run on the ANNs?  The work described here aims at answering these questions. We will use spatial frequency analysis to characterize the areas on mammogram cases where mammographers, chest radiologists with experience reading mammograms and radiology residents at the end of their mammography rotation, indicate the presence of a finding, or fail to do so. We will assess inter-observer agreement, as well as intra- and inter-group agreement for the various groups of observers. In addition, we will train artificial neural networks to represent each observer, in such a way that by changing the nature of the features input to the ANNs we will be able to simulate how such changes would have affected the actual observer. We will assess the effects on inter-observer variability of changing the search strategy used by the observer to sample the breast tissue. In our setting, the inter-observer variability will be assessed by comparing the outputs of the ANNs that represent each observer. In addition, the changes in sampling strategy will correspond to actual possible strategies for the human observers themselves. n/a",Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography,6821032,R21CA100107,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'human data', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mammography', 'visual perception']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2004,153968,-0.04173247733663487
"Multiparametric Computational Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In the United States, myocardial ischemia is the underlying etiology in nearly 70% of the 5 million patients suffering from mechanical failure of the cardiac left ventricle (LV). Echocardiography (echo) is well suited for the analysis of LV function, however, the problem of conveying this clinically important information in a quantitative, objective, and reproducible manner persists.      To address this problem and respond to the NIH PA-00-117 solicitation for innovations in biomedical information science and technology, the long-term goal of the proposed R21/R33 project is to develop methods for 1) quantitative and objective measurement of LV function, 2) reproducible diagnostic interpretation based on these measurements, and 3) standardized topologic mapping and parametric display of the results. We defined 3 parameters of LV function: 1) rate of local deformation (strain rate), 2) amplitude of deformation (strain), and 3) time interval to the transition (crossover) point of cyclic deformation.      The practical implementation of the long-term objectives will be achieved through the development of a Multiparametric Computational Echo (MPCE) system. The main hypothesis of this R21/R33 project is that the MPCE system will a) precisely and accurately quantitate (R21 phase) and b) reproducibly clinically interpret (R33 phase) segmental LV function. This hypothesis will be tested on digital echo data from animal models and clinical cases of myocardial ischemia representing a wide range of segmental LV dysfunction.      Specific Aims (R21 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop algorithms for parametric analysis of local ventricular function (Year 1).   Aim 2 - Test precision and accuracy of local LV functional analysis using MPCE (Year 2).   Satisfaction of the predefined milestones will initiate the commencement of the R33 phase.      Specific Aims (R33 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop a neural network MPCE system and test it initially in animals (Year 3).   Aim 2 - Refine parametric mapping and test reproducibility of MPCE data in humans (Year 4).   Successful completion of this project will result in noninvasive, quantitative, objective, and reproducible interpretation of LV function, thus facilitating optimal diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in cardiology. n/a",Multiparametric Computational Echocardiography,6783325,R21HL070363,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'echocardiography', 'evaluation /testing', 'heart function', 'human subject', 'method development', 'swine']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC,R21,2004,144693,-0.011282880310512836
"Neural network model of noise-induced hearing loss DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the proposed work is to develop a prediction model using radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) that will predict the auditory consequences of excessive noise exposure in a chinchilla model. The RBFNN model will be fed training data from our existing database (chinchilla) consisting of noise exposure metrics and audiometric/histological/otoacoustic emission data acquired from previously exposed animals. Once trained, the model will be able to predict the auditory consequences of exposure to any noise environment characterized by ten noise metrics and five biological variables of the animals that are input to the model. There are two phases to this research. The first phase is the design of the system structure and implementation software (Year 1). The second phase involves training the system using an extensive database consisting of more than 2500 subjects on which comprehensive exposure and audiometric/histological data are available (Year 2). The training period will be an iterative process in which the RBFNN will be modified as training proceeds. The prediction model can also be used to design experimental conditions from which the model can be experimentally tested. The successful demonstration of the application of a RBFNN to the prediction of noise-induced auditory effects has considerable potential for application to the assessment of industrial and military noise environments for the protection of hearing in humans, and can result in a considerable savings in the amount of work/resources that are needed to develop new and improved noise standards. Specifically, given the many similarities in the response to noise of the chinchilla and the human, the model can be used to identify combinations of parameters of an exposure that are important determinants of damage that would also be applicable to human exposure conditions. The chinchilla model can be used as a template or a guide for developing a human model possibly from some of the existing human data from which current standards were developed. n/a",Neural network model of noise-induced hearing loss,6820323,R03OH008175,"['artificial intelligence', 'chinchilla', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'disease /disorder model', 'environmental exposure', 'model design /development', 'noise biological effect', 'noise induced deafness']",NIOSH,PLATTSBURGH STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2004,71000,-0.01107744750997

"Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The elaboration of the sequences of the human genome and those of many cellular and viral parasites has given us an unprecedented opportunity to address the causes and treatment of every major human disease. It has also resulted in the formation of an entirely new field, bioinformatics, which promises to manage and analyze the vast amount of data being generated. Bioinformatics needs to supply tools for data analysis and tools for experimental design. Most of the scientific and corporate resources being expended in bioinformatics are being spent on data analysis tools. While these are essential, we should not neglect the opportunity to accelerate the progress of actual experimental biology. Essentially every experiment in biology now begins with cloning one or more pieces of DNA. Commercial software that facilitates virtual DNA cloning does exist, but it lacks any automation features and depends on primitive and/or fragmentary gene and vector databases. It is inadequate in planning the hundreds or thousands of clones necessary to address questions posed by the proteomics initiatives, because the lack of knowledge integration. In Phase I of this SBIR grant, we have built and tested a virtual cloning expert system, along with a very useful gene database and a uniquely annotated vector database that serve as a knowledge base for automated DNA manipulations. A collection of automated cloning modules and databases is now functional. In Phase II we will complete the virtual cloning expert system and develop a flexible platform for automated experimental design, data management and analysis. We will also construct a user database, improve the user interface and establish security protocols.

"Multi-Agent Collaboration for AMD Subtype Classification  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in developed countries and as such represents a very significant public health problem a number of specific genes, and the discovery, characterization, and eventual therapeutic control of these genes represent major goals of the vision research community. Although the strategies for gene discovery have become very powerful in recent years, there remains a major obstacle to the discovery of genes that underlie common, late-onset diseases like AMD. That obstacle is that clinicians cannot reliably sort patients with different molecular subtypes of late-onset disease into sufficiently homogeneous groups. The purpose of this project is to use the power of multi-agent systems computer technology in a novel way to aid clinicians in the collaborative development of a robust classification system based upon the ophthalmoscopic features of AMD. The result of this project will contribute to an NIH's Innovations in Biomedical Information and Science and Technology Program goal of speeding the progress of biomedical research through the development tools for electronic collaboration that will have impact on broader areas of biomedical research.   We hypothesize that a multi-agent approach to this problem will result in a classification system with greater reproducibility and discriminative power than a system developed by clinicians without such computer assistance. The availability of populations of AMD patients with lower molecular complexity will significantly increase the power of statistical techniques for AMD gene discovery. In addition to this immediate and specific benefit, the strategies we will develop during this project for objectively interfacing medical experts with each other as well as with computers will have applications in the search for other late-onset disease genes as well as in the development of multi-center and multidisciplinary clinical trials of new therapeutic approaches. The proposed system, the Intelligent Distributed Ontology Consensus system (IDOCS) goes beyond conventional groupware by addressing drawbacks to direct, synchronous interaction by providing an autonomously coordinated, asynchronous interaction and collaboration platform among clinicians through their representative intelligent agents.

"Validating and Translating Array Signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   In the area of cancer, microarray analysis is being used to identify specific differences between normal and disease tissues. Such efforts are leading to the identification of small gene sets, or signatures, that can provide key information for classifying cancer types. We propose here a mechanism for translating these discoveries into cost-effective, quantitative assays based on the use of highly multiplexed, universal-primer-driven rtPCR (UP-rtPCR). In this proposal we will demonstrate and validate the combined use of artificial neural network analysis for identification of small gene signatures and UP-rtPCR technology for translating these signatures into high throughput assays for use in research and clinical settings. Success will be measured by the ability of this approach to differentiate 4 types of small, round, blue-cell tumors. This work will be performed in collaboration with Drs.

"Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to use neuroinformatics to help resolve the conflicting findings from which two models of olfactory coding have emerged. One model proposes that very many low-specificity neural responses represent each odorant and the other model suggests that fewer, more specific olfactory receptors bind to particular molecular features and that the combination of these specific responses characterizes each odorant. Since much of the data supporting the low-specificity model has been collected without regard for the exquisite spatial heterogeneity of the olfactory system, it is possible that the differences in conclusions could be resolved if the distinct types of data that are collected by various laboratories were placed into spatial register with one another. To that end, we have been building an archive of the spatial patterns of glomerular responses evoked by a wide range of odorants, and we have been able to test hypotheses regarding strategies of olfactory coding by calculating homologies across glomerular-layer response patterns. To facilitate our analytical task, and to make it feasible for others to place their data in register with this odorant response archive, we propose to continue to develop analytical and visualization software for olfactory bulb data. We also propose to extend this approach to both the olfactory epithelium and olfactory cortex to be able to understand both the initial coding and synthetic levels of the olfactory system.  These efforts will be freely available via the web site on which our olfactory activity archive is posted. We propose to improve the site by incorporating meta-data, as well as data from labs using other species and other types of data, such as lesions and neurophysiological data that can be located in space. Finally, the wide range of odorants that we must test to capture a sense of the system also will necessitate the use of an informatics approach to allow us to test hypotheses regarding the complex means by which chemical structure is represented in the system. The combination of these approaches should help resolve the differences between the conflicting models of olfactory coding. n/a",Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding,6803809,R01DC006516,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'bioinformatics', 'chemoreceptors', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'image processing', 'information retrieval', 'laboratory mouse', 'laboratory rat', 'mathematical model', 'meta analysis', 'neural information processing', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'olfactions', 'olfactory lobe', 'olfactory stimulus', 'respiratory epithelium', 'sensory mechanism', 'stimulus /response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE,R01,2004,20000,-0.014302878799391775

"Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets Privacy is a fundamental right and needs to be protected.  For health care related d information, there are regulations for disclosure.  These regulations were motivated by the public's concern of breaches of confidentiality that might result in discrimination.  The recent progress in electronic medical record technology, the Internet, and the genetic revolution, together with media reports on violations of privacy have generated increasing interest in this topic.  A common belief is that sensitive information is more easily available with the use of networked computers. Since total lack of disclosure is not realistic, current regulations require that the ""minimal amount"" of information be given to a certain party.  A thorough study on what constitutes ""minimal"" for particular types of applications and a ""usefulness index"" is lacking.  An exact quantification of the potential for privacy breach in de-identified or anonymized databases is also lacking.  Definition and quantification of these indices is important for decision-making.  As we demonstrate, de-identified data sets can still be used for inference and therefore may disclose sensitive information.  The use of machine learning methods to verify the remaining functional dependencies in a de- identified data set leads to better understanding of the possible inferences.  Anonymization techniques based on logic, statistics, database theory, and machine learning methods can help in the protection of privacy. We will formally define and study anonymity in databases, from a theoretical and a practical standpoint.  We will develop and implement algorithms to anonymize data sets that will be in accordance with the balance of anonymity and ""usefulness"" of the disclosed data sets.  We will also develop and implement algorithms to verify the anonymity of a given data set and indicate the type of records that are at highest risk for a privacy attack.

"Integrated Neuroinformatics Resource for Alcoholism (IN* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to establish an Integrated Neuroinformatics Resource on Alcoholism (INRA) as the informatics core component of the Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism Consortium (INIA). The overall goal of the INRA will be to create an integrated, multiresolution repository of neuroscience data, ranging from molecules to behavior for collaborative research on alcoholism. As the neuroinformatics core of the INIAC, the INRA will enable the integration of all data generated by all components of the INIAC.

"Access to distributed de-identified imaging data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The widespread adoption of picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) in radiology and the implementation and deployment of the DICOM communication standard represent an opportunity to link multiple PACS at multiple sites into a distributed data warehouse of great potential utility for investigators in oncology research and epidemiology. Where the federal HIPAA privacy regulations have largely been seen as an emerging impediment to oncology research from the creation, management and use of cancer registries to large-scale retrospective studies addressing rarer forms of neoplasia, in fact the digital nature of PACS-based imaging data lends itself to automated de-identification that could transform multiple distributed clinical information systems into a readily accessible treasure trove of research data that falls within the ""safe harbor"" provisions of HIPAA's privacy regulations. Our firm has developed a platform, originally intended for clinical use, to securely link multiple PACS and RIS from multiple vendors beneath a web interface giving users transparent access to a ""virtual archive"" spanning an arbitrary number of institutions. In this Phase I SBIR application, we propose to explore the feasibility of extending our system to grant researchers access to large volumes of dynamically de-identified imaging data while surmounting each of the major criticisms of the viability of such data for research purposes. We propose developing an open web-services architecture that will enable straightforward integration with any other information system and propose a design that adheres to existing industry standards while laying the groundwork for compliance with future standards and informatics initiatives. This study will also involve examining the regulation of re-identification through the use of threshold cryptography, as well as the feasibility of a probabilistic sampling search engine intended to prevent unauthorized identification of patients through multiple intersecting queries on narrowing criteria, while still permitting researchers to choose the appropriate resolving power of the engine to suit a particular investigation. These studies will include benchmarking the performance of these dynamic processes, quantifying the load they place on live clinical information systems, and optimizing the design to minimize such impact. Should feasibility be demonstrated, Phase II would involve a proof-of-concept demonstration across multiple academic medical institutions as well as steps to prepare for commercialization including indexing studies based on structured reporting and natural language processing, content-based information retrieval, refinement and usability testing of the web interfaces, and extension of the system to permit IRB-approved research on individually-identifiable data. Commercialization is expected as subscription service not unlike current bioinformatics databases, granting investigators access to a large-scale, globally distributed data warehouse comprised of participating PACS-enabled medical centers. n/a",Access to distributed de-identified imaging data,6777517,R43EB000608,"['archives', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'confidentiality', 'data management', 'health care policy', 'health related legal', 'human data', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'information systems']",NIBIB,"HX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2004,149200,-0.023935175358166576
"Detecting relations among heterogeneous genomic datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past decade, the new focus on genomics has highlighted a particular challenge: to integrate the different views of the genome that are provided by various types of experimental data. The long-term objective of this work is to provide a coherent computational framework for integrating and drawing inferences from a collection of genome-wide measurements. Hence, the proposed research plan develops algorithms and computational tools for learning from heterogeneous data sets. We focus on the analysis of the yeast genome because so many genome-wide data sets are currently available; however, the tools we develop will be applicable to any genome. We approach this task using two recent trends from the field of machine learning: kernel algorithms that represent data via specialized similarity functions, and transductive algorithms that exploit the availability of unlabeled test data during the training phase of the algorithm. We apply focus on two tasks: (1) classifying groups of genes that are of interest to our collaborators, including components of the spindle pole body, cell cycle regulated genes, and genes involved in meiosis and sporulation, splicing, alcohol metabolism, etc., and (2) prediction of protein-protein interactions. These two specific aims are not only important scientific tasks, but also represent typical challenges that future genomic studies will face. Accomplishing these aims requires the integration of many heterogeneous sources of data, the prediction of multiple properties of genes and proteins, the explicit introduction of domain knowledge, the automatic introduction of knowledge from side information, scalability to large data sizes, and tolerance of large levels of noise.         n/a",Detecting relations among heterogeneous genomic datasets,6737944,R33HG003070,"['cell cycle', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection', 'genome', 'informatics', 'meiosis', 'metabolism', 'protein protein interaction']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2004,400000,-0.03846996108854253
"Tree Ensemble Regression and Classification Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This SBIR aims to produce next generation classification and regression software based upon ensembles of decision trees: bagging, random forests, and boosting. The prediction accuracy of these methods has caused much excitement in the machine learning community, and both challenges and complements the data modeling culture prevalent among biostatisticians. Recent research extends the methodology to likelihood based methods used in biostatistics, leading to models for survival data and generalized forest models. Generalized forest models extend regression forests in the same way that generalized linear models extend linear models.      This software would apply broadly, including to medical diagnosis, prognostic modeling, and detecting cancer; and for modeling patient characteristics like blood pressure, discrete responses in clinical trials, and count data.      Phase I work will prototype software for survival data, and investigate the performance of ensemble methods on simulated and real data. For survival applications, we will assess out-of-bag estimates of performance, and investigate measures of variable importance and graphics that help clinicians understand the results.

"Artificial Intelligence Methods for Crystallization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely believed that crystallization is the rate-limiting step in most X-ray structure determinations. We have therefore been developing computational tools to facilitate this process, including the XtalGrow suite of programs. Here we propose to improve the power and scope of these tools along two fronts: 1. Initial screening, the (iterative) set of experiments that hopefully, yields one or more preliminary ""hits"" (crystalline material that is demonstrably protein); and 2. Optimization experiments that begin with an initial hit and end with diffraction-quality crystals. A central concept of this proposal is that this tool building requires a knowledge-based foundation. Therefore, one of the broad goals of the proposal is to develop a framework for the acquisition and encoding of knowledge in computationally tractable forms; specifically, forms that will yield more effective crystallization procedures. We are interested in how the data interact and how that can be used to improve the crystallization process. While available data, both in the literature and from other projects in the laboratory will continue to be used wherever possible, our analysis has also demonstrated the need to be pro-active i.e. to gather selected data required to complete the knowledge base. We propose to do this by: I. Deepening the data representations is several areas including additional protein characteristics, incorporating a hierarchy of chemical additives and acquiring detailed response data. 11. Improving the efficiency of crystallization screens: Initial crystallization screens would be improved by applying inductive reasoning to the refinement of Bayesian belief nets; procedures would also be developed for dealing with the absence of promising results by identifying unexplored regions of the parameter space and using additional measurements, such as dynamic light scattering and cloud point determinations to further refine the Bayesian belief nets and steer experimentation in more promising directions. Optimization screens would be improved by applying Case-Based and Bayesian methods here as well as by further developments of automated image analysis. III.

"Development of a Multi-State Decoding Framework DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to increase the capability and decrease the cost of decoding the Illumina bead array platform by adding decode states. DNA probes attached to microbeads are randomly loaded onto fiber optic bundles. A decoding process of sequential hybridization stages is necessary to determine the locus correspondence of each bead. Decoders (sequences complementary to the DNA probes on the beads) that are either unlabeled, or labeled with a dye are hybridized to the array. Images are taken after each hybridization, and the experiment is designed so that the hybridization signature of each bead through the decode process, uniquely determines the identity of the bead. The cost and time of decoding is proportional to the number of decode stages. The number of stages is determined by the number of loci represented on the array and the number of distinguishable labels, or decode states, used in the decode process (e.g. ON in dye 1). The current availability of 3 states allows the decoding of 1,500 probes in 8 stages. The successful execution of this project would extend the number of states to at least 8. With 8 states, the number of stages for the 1,500-probe product would become 4. The number of probes that could be decoded in 8 stages would increase by 3 orders of magnitude. The main components of the project are wet lab chemistry and algorithm development. Wet lab chemistry will be used to determine the optimal mixture of dye labeled and unlabeled oligonucleotides that will lead to distinguishable intensity states. Beads will have signal levels in FAM and CY3 dye. Variability in the process will need to be sufficiently low to reliably distinguish different concentrations of dye labeled oligonucleo tides. Three levels of FAM and CY3 signal would lead to 9 states. It is likely that 8 of these will be reliably distinguishable. Pattern matching algorithms will be developed to decode the beads. Decision tree methods based on expected signal will be applied. Arrays will be decoded twice -- first with the current 3-state decoding, and then with the multi-state decoding -- to enable training and machine learning algorithms. Achieving 8 state decoding will decrease the cost of the array and dramatically increase the number of loci explored and the number of probes per locus. n/a",Development of a Multi-State Decoding Framework,6737095,R43HG003096,"['chemistry', ' cost effectiveness', ' dyes', ' mathematics', ' microarray technology', ' nucleic acid probes', ' technology /technique development']",NHGRI,"ILLUMINA, INC.",R43,2003,141830,-0.01189762850449361
"Inference in Regression Models with Missing Covariates DESCRIPTION:  (Adapted from investigator's abstract) This project will examine new methodology for making inference about the regression parameters in the presence of missing covariate data for two commonly used classes of regression models.  In particular, we examine the class of generalized linear models for general types of response data and the Cox model for survival data.  The methodology addresses problems occurring frequently in clinical investigations for chronic disease, including cancer and AIDS.  The specific objectives of the project are to:  1) develop and study classical and Bayesian methods of inference for the class of generalized linear models (GLM's) in the presence of missing covariate data.  In particular, we will  i) examine methods for estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is ignorable.  Also, parametric models for the covariate distribution will be examined.  The methods of estimation will focus on the Monte Carlo version of the EM algorithm (Wei and Tanner, 1990) and other related iterative algorithms.  The Gibbs sampler (Gelfand and Smith, 1990) along with the adaptive rejection algorithm of Gilks and Wild (1992) will be used to sample from the conditional distribution of the missing covariates given the observed data.  ii) examine estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is nonignorable.  Models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  iii) develop and study Bayesian methods of inference in the presence of missing covariate data when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is ignorable.  Parametric prior distributions for the regression coefficients are proposed.  Properties of the posterior distributions of the regression coefficients will be studied.  The methodology will be implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods similar to those of Tanner and Wong (1987). iv) investigate Bayesian methods when the covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is nonignorable.  Multinomial models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  Dirichlet prior distributions for the multinomial parameters will be investigated.  2) develop and study classical and Bayesian methods of inference for the Cox model for survival outcomes in the presence of missing covariates.  Specifically, we will  i) develop and study estimation methods for the Cox model for survival outcomes in the presence of missing covariates. Methods for estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous will be studied.  The methods of estimation will focus on an EM type algorithm similar to that of Wei and Tanner (1990).  ii) study estimation of the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanisms nonignorable.  Models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  Bayesian methods similar to those of 1-iii) and -iv) will be investigated. Computational techniques using the Monte Carlo methods described in 1-iii) will be implemented.  n/a",Inference in Regression Models with Missing Covariates,6617906,R01CA074015,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer data analysis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' mathematical model', ' method development', ' model design /development', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2003,170109,-0.0003992218652051992
"Permutation Test Software for Randomized Clinical Trials The randomized clinical trial (RCT) is arguably the linchpin of the drug development process, and the results of an RCT are almost always analyzed using some form of statistical hypothesis test. The most frequently used hypothesis tests assume a population model for statistical inference, even though a randomization model is more consistent with real-world characteristics of RCTs. Approximate p- values returned by population-model tests can, under certain circumstances, be misleading, resulting in effective drugs being declared ineffective, or ineffective drugs being declared effective. To support analysis of RCTs using the appropriate randomization model, sophisticated software for conducting randomization-based permutation tests is needed. Ongoing advances in computing technology have created a favorable climate for widespread use of such software. The goal of this research is to develop flexible and robust software for carrying out randomization-based permutation tests for single- or multi- clinic RCTs. A subset of this functionality has been successfully implemented in a Phase I pre-prototype (""RTAnalyzer""). Phase II seeks to build a full-scale prototype capable of handling a wide variety of trial designs, including designs using adaptive randomization. The Phase II project includes collaborations with two experts in the field of permutation testing: Dr. William Rosenberger and Dr. Bonnie LaFleur. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Software that can use general permutation tests to analyze clinical trial data would have clear commercial value to clinical research organizations in academia, Government, and the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. Key applications are the analysis of clinical trials with unusual randomization schemes, trials with unusual patterns of treatment response, and trials where standard distributional assumptions are invalid. n/a",Permutation Test Software for Randomized Clinical Trials,6622262,R44CA086556,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical trials', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' experimental designs', ' human data', ' mathematics', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,"LINCOLN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2003,373280,-0.009663011749022461
"BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration & Analysis System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to collaborate with a group of biology researchers with real world needs to develop and distribute a general-purpose system (BioMediator) to permit integration and analysis of diverse types of biologic data. BioMediator will combine information from a variety of different public and private sources (e.g. experimental data) to help answer biologic questions. BioMediator builds on the foundations laid by the currently funded GeneSeek data integration system. The GeneSeek system was originally developed to query only public domain data sources (both structured and semi-structured) to assist in the curation of the GeneClinics genetic testing knowledge base. The specific aims leading to the development of the BioMediator system are: 1) Interface to additional public domain biological data sources (e.g. pathway databases, function databases). 2) Incorporate access to private databases of experimental results (e.g. proteomics and expression array data). 3) Extend model to include analytic tools operating across distributed biological data sources (e.g. across a set of both proteomic and expression array data). 4) Evolve centralized BioMediator system into a model peer to peer data sharing and analysis system. 5) Distribute and maintain BioMediator production software as a resource for the biological community. The health relatedness of the project is that biologists seeking to understand the molecular basis of human health and disease are struggling with large and increasing volumes of diverse data (mutation, expression array, proteomic) that need to be brought together (integrated) and analyzed in order to develop and test hypotheses about disease mechanisms and normal physiology. The research design is to develop BioMediator by combining and leverage recent developments in a) the domain of open source analytic tools for biologic data and b) ongoing theoretical and applied research by members of the current GeneSeek research team on both general purpose and biologic data integration systems. The methods are:  a) to use an iterative rapid prototyping software development model evaluated in a real-world test bed and b) to expand the existing GeneSeek research team (with expertise in informatics, computer science, and software development) to include biological expertise (four biologists forming a biology working group) and biostatistics expertise. The goal is to ensure the BioMediator system 1) meets the needs of a group of end users acquiring, integrating and analyzing diverse biologic data sets, 2) does so in a scaleable and expandable manner drawing on the latest theoretical developments in data analysis and integration. n/a",BioMediator: Biologic Data Integration & Analysis System,6681249,R01HG002288,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' information retrieval', ' molecular biology information system']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2003,100000,0.00671891444194102
"Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Exact Logistic Regression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today, software for fitting logistic regression models to binary data belongs in the toolkit of every professional biostatistician, epidemiologist, and social scientist. A natural follow-up to this development is the adoption of exact logistic regression by mainstream biostatisticians and data analysts for any setting in which the accuracy of a statistical analysis based on large-sample maximum likelihood theory is in doubt. Cutting-edge researchers in biometry and numerous other fields have already recognized that it is necessary to supplement inference based on large-sample methods with exact inference for small, sparse and unbalanced data. The LogXact software package developed by Cytel Software Corporation fills this need. It has been used since its inception in 1993 to produce exact inferences for data generated from a wide range fields including clinical trials, epidemiology, disease surveillance, insurance, criminology, finance, accounting, sociology and ecology. In all these applications exact logistic regression was adopted because the limitations of the corresponding asymptotic procedures were clearly recognized in advance by the investigators and the exact inference was computationally feasible. But most of the time it will not be obvious whether asymptotic or exact methods are applicable. Ideally one would prefer to run both types of analyses if there is any doubt about the appropriateness of the asymptotic inference. However, because of the computational limits of the exact algorithms, investigators are currently inhibited from attempting the exact analysis. There is uncertainty about the how long the computations will take and even whether they will produce any results at all before the computer runs out of memory. The current project eliminates this uncertainty by introducing a new generation of numerical algorithms that utilize network based Monte Carlo rejection sampling. The Phase 1 progress report has demonstrated that these new algorithms can speed up the computations by factors of 50 to 1000 relative to what is currently available in LogXact. More importantly they can predict how long a job will take so that the user may decide whether to proceed at once or at a better time. The Phase 2 effort aims to incorporate this new generation of computing algorithms into future versions of LogXact.         n/a",Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Exact Logistic Regression,6587476,R44CA093112,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' human data', ' mathematical model', ' mathematics', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,CYTEL SOFTWARE CORPORATION,R44,2003,400084,0.004998324525814063
"Multiparametric Computational Echocardiography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In the United States, myocardial ischemia is the underlying etiology in nearly 70% of the 5 million patients suffering from mechanical failure of the cardiac left ventricle (LV). Echocardiography (echo) is well suited for the analysis of LV function, however, the problem of conveying this clinically important information in a quantitative, objective, and reproducible manner persists.      To address this problem and respond to the NIH PA-00-117 solicitation for innovations in biomedical information science and technology, the long-term goal of the proposed R21/R33 project is to develop methods for 1) quantitative and objective measurement of LV function, 2) reproducible diagnostic interpretation based on these measurements, and 3) standardized topologic mapping and parametric display of the results. We defined 3 parameters of LV function: 1) rate of local deformation (strain rate), 2) amplitude of deformation (strain), and 3) time interval to the transition (crossover) point of cyclic deformation.      The practical implementation of the long-term objectives will be achieved through the development of a Multiparametric Computational Echo (MPCE) system. The main hypothesis of this R21/R33 project is that the MPCE system will a) precisely and accurately quantitate (R21 phase) and b) reproducibly clinically interpret (R33 phase) segmental LV function. This hypothesis will be tested on digital echo data from animal models and clinical cases of myocardial ischemia representing a wide range of segmental LV dysfunction.      Specific Aims (R21 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop algorithms for parametric analysis of local ventricular function (Year 1).   Aim 2 - Test precision and accuracy of local LV functional analysis using MPCE (Year 2).   Satisfaction of the predefined milestones will initiate the commencement of the R33 phase.      Specific Aims (R33 phase):   Aim 1 - Develop a neural network MPCE system and test it initially in animals (Year 3).   Aim 2 - Refine parametric mapping and test reproducibility of MPCE data in humans (Year 4).

The proposed System for Cost Effective Trials (SCET) will be a software package to guide the trial designer through comparisons of the power, sample size requirements, and cost of alternate trial designs. These methods are under-used throughout medical research, but are particularly applicable to trials with relatively short treatment regimens and rapid ascertainment of endpoints, such as many cancer treatment trials. The aims of SCET Phase II are to build the system, validate it in compliance with FDA regulations for software validation, perform Beta testing at a range of target client organizations, and use the Beta test findings to produce a marketable release. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The potential market for this software system includes virtually every pharmaceutical company in the world (multiple licenses to each), every biotech company involved in clinical trials, every contract research organization involved in the design or conduct of clinical trials, coordinating centers of NIH-sponsored multi-center clinical trials, individual university-based investigators who conduct clinical trials, individual biostatistical consultants who design clinical trials, and agricultural businesses and researchers that conduct animal research. n/a",System for Cost Effective Clinical Trial Design,6626050,R44CA088667,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical trials', ' computer data analysis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' cost effectiveness', ' drug design /synthesis /production', ' experimental designs']",NCI,"RHO FEDERAL SYSTEMS DIVISION, INC.",R44,2003,386197,-0.012872646150176456
"Software to Handle Missing Values in Large Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This SBIR aims to produce commercial software for handling missing data in large data sets, where the goal is data mining and knowledge discovery. There may be a large number of subjects, variables, or both. Examples include microarray data, surveys, genomic data, and high throughput screening data.      Handling missing data is one important step of careful data preparation, which is key to the success of an entire project. Missing values often arise in medical data. This is an obstacle because many data mining tools either require complete data or are not robust to missing data.      Principled methods of handling missing data are computationally intensive. Therefore computational feasibility is a challenge to handling missing values in large data sets.      Phase I work will explore strategies such as sampling, constraining parameters, and monotone data algorithms for model based techniques. Factor analysis and multivariate linear mixed effects models will be used to reduce the number of parameters. A variable-by-variable approach using a popular data mining technique, recursive partitioning, will also be used to impute missing values.      For each of the methods, we will write prototype software and test performance on missing data patterns simulated on real data. Several ad hoc techniques will serve as a baseline for comparison.   Experience writing prototypes and using them in simulations will lead to preliminary software design that will serve as the foundation of Phase II work.       This proposed software will enable medical researchers to gain more from their data mining efforts: maximally extracting information and achieving unbiased predictions, despite missing data. n/a",Software to Handle Missing Values in Large Data,6690119,R43RR017862,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' data management', ' human data', ' mathematical model', ' statistics /biometry']",NCRR,INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION,R43,2003,99847,0.00910422058363072

"KNOWLEDGED BASED SYSTEMS FOR DIAGNOSTIC HISTOPATHOLOGY  The proposed work extends previous research performed by this                                                                     investigator in the field of knowledge-based systems for the analysis of             histopathologic material, mainly neoplastic tissue; and mostly focusing on           adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The present application concerns the creation        of methods for the definition and analysis of novel histopathologic features         predominantly derived from nuclear image data, with the objective of defining        ""prototype identities."" According to the investigator, these are fundamental         complexes of histologic features unique to individual tissue samples, or small       groups of such samples, that should convey useful predictive value for               individual patients.

"Automated Quantitation of 3D Echocardiograms In Phase I we developed a method for automated border detection (ABD) of echocardiographic scans that is feasible for clinical application. The accuracy of our processes provides exceeds Phase I goals and is comparable to interobserver variability in measuring volume and ejection fraction, and in border location. For a diverse set of patients, we have achieved an accuracy of 10 ml for endocardial volume, 4% for ejection fraction, and ,2.0 mm for border position. Our processes operates in 4 min. In Phase II we propose to continue research and development to move our ABD technology closer to clinical user. Our first specific aim is to reduce the amount of manual input required even further. Our second aim is to develop a prototype system suitable for clinical evaluation. Our third aim is to perform a pilot trial to evaluate the performance of our ABD process, as a preparation for a more formal, multi-center clinical trial planned for Phase III. The proposed research is important because quantitative 3D echo provides greater accuracy and reproducibility and more comprehensive information on cardiac status than currently available imaging techniques. The significant advantages of 3D echo are not currently available for clinical practice because it is impractical without automation. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Automation of echocardiogram border detection enables physicians to obtain accurate, reproducible and comprehensive measurements of the heart's size, shape and function.

"Multi-Agent Collaboration for AMD Subtype Classification  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in developed countries and as such represents a very significant public health problem a number of specific genes, and the discovery, characterization, and eventual therapeutic control of these genes represent major goals of the vision research community. Although the strategies for gene discovery have become very powerful in recent years, there remains a major obstacle to the discovery of genes that underlie common, late-onset diseases like AMD. That obstacle is that clinicians cannot reliably sort patients with different molecular subtypes of late-onset disease into sufficiently homogeneous groups. The purpose of this project is to use the power of multi-agent systems computer technology in a novel way to aid clinicians in the collaborative development of a robust classification system based upon the ophthalmoscopic features of AMD. The result of this project will contribute to an NIH's Innovations in Biomedical Information and Science and Technology Program goal of speeding the progress of biomedical research through the development tools for electronic collaboration that will have impact on broader areas of biomedical research.   We hypothesize that a multi-agent approach to this problem will result in a classification system with greater reproducibility and discriminative power than a system developed by clinicians without such computer assistance. The availability of populations of AMD patients with lower molecular complexity will significantly increase the power of statistical techniques for AMD gene discovery. In addition to this immediate and specific benefit, the strategies we will develop during this project for objectively interfacing medical experts with each other as well as with computers will have applications in the search for other late-onset disease genes as well as in the development of multi-center and multidisciplinary clinical trials of new therapeutic approaches. The proposed system, the Intelligent Distributed Ontology Consensus system (IDOCS) goes beyond conventional groupware by addressing drawbacks to direct, synchronous interaction by providing an autonomously coordinated, asynchronous interaction and collaboration platform among clinicians through their representative intelligent agents.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6633609,R33CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2003,618638,-0.014251145518430867

"Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets Privacy is a fundamental right and needs to be protected.  For health care related d information, there are regulations for disclosure.  These regulations were motivated by the public's concern of breaches of confidentiality that might result in discrimination.  The recent progress in electronic medical record technology, the Internet, and the genetic revolution, together with media reports on violations of privacy have generated increasing interest in this topic.  A common belief is that sensitive information is more easily available with the use of networked computers. Since total lack of disclosure is not realistic, current regulations require that the ""minimal amount"" of information be given to a certain party.  A thorough study on what constitutes ""minimal"" for particular types of applications and a ""usefulness index"" is lacking.  An exact quantification of the potential for privacy breach in de-identified or anonymized databases is also lacking.  Definition and quantification of these indices is important for decision-making.  As we demonstrate, de-identified data sets can still be used for inference and therefore may disclose sensitive information.  The use of machine learning methods to verify the remaining functional dependencies in a de- identified data set leads to better understanding of the possible inferences.  Anonymization techniques based on logic, statistics, database theory, and machine learning methods can help in the protection of privacy. We will formally define and study anonymity in databases, from a theoretical and a practical standpoint.  We will develop and implement algorithms to anonymize data sets that will be in accordance with the balance of anonymity and ""usefulness"" of the disclosed data sets.  We will also develop and implement algorithms to verify the anonymity of a given data set and indicate the type of records that are at highest risk for a privacy attack.

"Access to distributed de-identified imaging data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The widespread adoption of picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) in radiology and the implementation and deployment of the DICOM communication standard represent an opportunity to link multiple PACS at multiple sites into a distributed data warehouse of great potential utility for investigators in oncology research and epidemiology. Where the federal HIPAA privacy regulations have largely been seen as an emerging impediment to oncology research from the creation, management and use of cancer registries to large-scale retrospective studies addressing rarer forms of neoplasia, in fact the digital nature of PACS-based imaging data lends itself to automated de-identification that could transform multiple distributed clinical information systems into a readily accessible treasure trove of research data that falls within the ""safe harbor"" provisions of HIPAA's privacy regulations. Our firm has developed a platform, originally intended for clinical use, to securely link multiple PACS and RIS from multiple vendors beneath a web interface giving users transparent access to a ""virtual archive"" spanning an arbitrary number of institutions. In this Phase I SBIR application, we propose to explore the feasibility of extending our system to grant researchers access to large volumes of dynamically de-identified imaging data while surmounting each of the major criticisms of the viability of such data for research purposes. We propose developing an open web-services architecture that will enable straightforward integration with any other information system and propose a design that adheres to existing industry standards while laying the groundwork for compliance with future standards and informatics initiatives. This study will also involve examining the regulation of re-identification through the use of threshold cryptography, as well as the feasibility of a probabilistic sampling search engine intended to prevent unauthorized identification of patients through multiple intersecting queries on narrowing criteria, while still permitting researchers to choose the appropriate resolving power of the engine to suit a particular investigation. These studies will include benchmarking the performance of these dynamic processes, quantifying the load they place on live clinical information systems, and optimizing the design to minimize such impact. Should feasibility be demonstrated, Phase II would involve a proof-of-concept demonstration across multiple academic medical institutions as well as steps to prepare for commercialization including indexing studies based on structured reporting and natural language processing, content-based information retrieval, refinement and usability testing of the web interfaces, and extension of the system to permit IRB-approved research on individually-identifiable data.

"AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY Molecular microscopy has become an increasingly important tool for structural biology but the methodology is very labor intensive and very slow.  It is generally recognized that the development of improved capabilities for three-dimensional electron microscopy are critical for progress in emerging integrative research in molecular cell biology.  We aim to develop a system for rapid routine structure determination of macromolecular assemblies.  Our ultimate goal is to develop an integrated system that can produce a three-dimensional electron density map of a structure within a few hours of inserting a specimen in the electron microscope.  The motivation for this work is to provide answers to interesting biological questions. We will initially use our work on motor-microtubule complexes and actomyosin as the driver for the development of the integrated system.  By tightly coupling the development of the new system with its implementation in a laboratory whose primary goal is answering fundamental questions in cell biology, we will obtain immediate and invaluable feedback as to how the system is used in practice. Developing this system will involve devising new approaches and integrating the results of several ongoing research projects. The primary specific aims are:  (1) To remove the requirement for using film to acquire the high magnification electron micrographs.  This will require the development of feature recognition algorithms and new imaging strategies that take into account the characteristics of currently available digital cameras.  (2) Improve and automate our existing software for helical image analysis.  We will incorporate new methods for determining the helical parameters of an unknown specimen, methods for improving the resolution, and methods for analyzing non-helical specimens.  (3) Integration of the acquisition and the analysis steps.  This will require incorporation of machine learning techniques to produce a system that is highly efficient in terms of throughput and data quality. The general framework for integrated acquisition and analysis to be developed will be readily extendible to other specimens (helical tubes, single particles, two-dimensional crystals). Thus, once the system has been successfully implemented it will be made generally available to the scientific community.  The system we plan to develop has the potential to revolutionize the field of three-dimensional electron microscopy and make this approach accessible to a wide community.  n/a",AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY,6636516,R01GM061939,"['actins', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' digital imaging', ' electron density', ' electron microscopy', ' image processing', ' microtubules', ' myosins', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2003,374063,-0.009509631704842005

"Inference in Regression Models with Missing Covariates DESCRIPTION:  (Adapted from investigator's abstract) This project will examine new methodology for making inference about the regression parameters in the presence of missing covariate data for two commonly used classes of regression models.  In particular, we examine the class of generalized linear models for general types of response data and the Cox model for survival data.  The methodology addresses problems occurring frequently in clinical investigations for chronic disease, including cancer and AIDS.  The specific objectives of the project are to:  1) develop and study classical and Bayesian methods of inference for the class of generalized linear models (GLM's) in the presence of missing covariate data.  In particular, we will  i) examine methods for estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is ignorable.

"Inference in Regression Models with Missing Covariates DESCRIPTION:  (Adapted from investigator's abstract) This project will examine new methodology for making inference about the regression parameters in the presence of missing covariate data for two commonly used classes of regression models.  In particular, we examine the class of generalized linear models for general types of response data and the Cox model for survival data.  The methodology addresses problems occurring frequently in clinical investigations for chronic disease, including cancer and AIDS.  The specific objectives of the project are to:  1) develop and study classical and Bayesian methods of inference for the class of generalized linear models (GLM's) in the presence of missing covariate data.  In particular, we will  i) examine methods for estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is ignorable.

"Permutation Test Software for Randomized Clinical Trials The randomized clinical trial (RCT) is arguably the linchpin of the drug development process, and the results of an RCT are almost always analyzed using some form of statistical hypothesis test. The most frequently used hypothesis tests assume a population model for statistical inference, even though a randomization model is more consistent with real-world characteristics of RCTs. Approximate p- values returned by population-model tests can, under certain circumstances, be misleading, resulting in effective drugs being declared ineffective, or ineffective drugs being declared effective. To support analysis of RCTs using the appropriate randomization model, sophisticated software for conducting randomization-based permutation tests is needed. Ongoing advances in computing technology have created a favorable climate for widespread use of such software. The goal of this research is to develop flexible and robust software for carrying out randomization-based permutation tests for single- or multi- clinic RCTs. A subset of this functionality has been successfully implemented in a Phase I pre-prototype (""RTAnalyzer""). Phase II seeks to build a full-scale prototype capable of handling a wide variety of trial designs, including designs using adaptive randomization. The Phase II project includes collaborations with two experts in the field of permutation testing: Dr. William Rosenberger and Dr. Bonnie LaFleur. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Software that can use general permutation tests to analyze clinical trial data would have clear commercial value to clinical research organizations in academia, Government, and the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. Key applications are the analysis of clinical trials with unusual randomization schemes, trials with unusual patterns of treatment response, and trials where standard distributional assumptions are invalid. n/a",Permutation Test Software for Randomized Clinical Trials,6444337,R44CA086556,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical trials', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' experimental designs', ' human data', ' mathematics', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,"LINCOLN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2002,362409,-0.009663011749022461
"System for Cost Effective Clinical Trial Design The long-term objective of this project is to develop software to facilitate the design of cost effective clinical trials. In 1999, the pharmaceutical industry and NIH spent more than $23 billion on clinical trials. Developments in clinical trial design theory, and in optimization algorithms have opened possibilities for more cost- effective designs that can be executed for lower total cost, over shorter periods of time and / or requiring fewer patients. The proposed System for Cost Effective Trials (SCET) will be a software package to guide the trial designer through comparisons of the power, sample size requirements, and cost of alternate trial designs. These methods are under-used throughout medical research, but are particularly applicable to trials with relatively short treatment regimens and rapid ascertainment of endpoints, such as many cancer treatment trials. The aims of SCET Phase II are to build the system, validate it in compliance with FDA regulations for software validation, perform Beta testing at a range of target client organizations, and use the Beta test findings to produce a marketable release. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The potential market for this software system includes virtually every pharmaceutical company in the world (multiple licenses to each), every biotech company involved in clinical trials, every contract research organization involved in the design or conduct of clinical trials, coordinating centers of NIH-sponsored multi-center clinical trials, individual university-based investigators who conduct clinical trials, individual biostatistical consultants who design clinical trials, and agricultural businesses and researchers that conduct animal research. n/a",System for Cost Effective Clinical Trial Design,6485420,R44CA088667,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical trials', ' computer data analysis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' cost effectiveness', ' drug design /synthesis /production', ' experimental designs']",NCI,"RHO FEDERAL SYSTEMS DIVISION, INC.",R44,2002,380192,-0.012872646150176456
"Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System A cancer genetics-tracking database will be redesigned using usability engineering techniques to improve the functionality and usability of the current system. This is important because it will lead to a system that is easier to use and learn, will decrease the chance of errors, and will increase productivity, and user satisfaction. The current state of informatics offers the potential for the creation of tools to assist in the reduction of medical errors. The redesign of this tracking database will be completed through a three-phase process. The first phase will use the results of a usability analysis to redesign and prototype the cancer genetics-tracking database. In the second phase, usability studies will then be conducted to ensure that the system is functional, easy to use, easy to learn, and meets the goals of the users. The usability studies will include heuristic evaluations, keystroke level models, talk-aloud methods, and cognitive walkthrough techniques. The system will be modified based upon the results of these studies. Research will be compiled on the advantages and disadvantages of ICD coding Vs. SNOMED followed by the selection of the most useful system for coding medical information. In the third phase the final redesign will be compared to the old system using a within-subject design to determine if the redesign decreases the error rate, increases productivity, and user satisfaction. This will be followed-up with a survey to determine the perceived usability of the redesigned application. Throughout the redesign process, specific usability guidelines will be developed for designing healthcare software that is computational and knowledge- based in nature.  n/a",Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System,6538226,F38LM007188,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer information system', ' cancer registry /resource', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' family genetics', ' human data', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,F38,2002,66954,-0.014312193709679727
"Automated PCR Pathogen Detection and Quantification  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We will develop software for automated pathogen detection and quantification using data from PCR experiments. Automated pathogen detection using data from a PCR experiment requires software to determine whether DNA from the pathogen is present or absent in a sample. We will develop a pattern-matching algorithm to mathematically analyze PCR amplification data. We will optimize the algorithm against a data set of at least 5000 PCR reactions (including a significant set of data gathered during the anthrax attack) to determine its efficacy and limitations. We expect the pathogen detection algorithms to distinguish positives samples from negative samples in more than 98% of the samples, to find inconclusive results in less than 1% of the samples, and to incorrectly classify less than 1% of the samples. We will also develop software to perform automated melting curve analysis of samples that our detection algorithm has determined to be positive or inconclusive. The melting profile of the probes is a property of the assay, and it can be used for secondary confirmation of a pathogen by comparing the profile of the unknown samples to the profile of the assay's positive controls. We will develop algorithms to automatically determine whether the melting profile of the sample and controls match. With melting analysis confirmation, the failure rate of the final detection algorithm should be less than 0.5%.   Automated pathogen quantification requires software to determine the number of copies of a pathogen's DNA in a sample. We will develop discrete dynamical models of PCR for quantification. We will optimize these methods against a large data set of PCR reactions with dilution series. We will systematically determine the features of the models that provide information and the features that can be ignored. We will measure efficacy by comparing computed DNA copy numbers against the known concentrations (as specified by experimenters), and against each other. We will use the most effective model (or models) in the software we produce.   n/a",Automated PCR Pathogen Detection and Quantification,6555484,R43AI052944,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioterrorism /chemical warfare', ' communicable disease diagnosis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' microorganism', ' nucleic acid denaturation', ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' phase change', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NIAID,IDAHO TECHNOLOGY,R43,2002,100000,-0.02015374416123282
"Diagnostic Logic and Adaptive Assessment for Psychiatry  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This SBIR Phase I application proposes to extend an existing multi-tier Internet client-server system (""CliniMetricar"") by integrating active diagnostic logic.  CliniMetrica currently provides systematic psychiatric assessment using the World Health Organization (WHO) Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, version 2.1). CliniMetrica automatically indexes digital audio recording of assessment interviews, and was developed with SBIR support from NIMH Digital video functions are currently being implemented and tested with additional NIMH support, as are functions to support remote psychometrics for the training and monitoring of interviewers.  The CliniMetrica system is increasing in sophistication and functionality, and has applications for clinical research (e.g., clinical trials) as well as for more routine clinical practice.  The current lack of fully developed and tested diagnostic functionality is a major gap.  A number of potential customers have requested integrated DSM-IV and/or lCD-10 diagnostic results to be automatically linked to assessments.  In order to meet this market need, we propose to implement the DSM-IV and ICD-10 nosologic systems as two classification knowledge bases that a logic engine will process to generate diagnostic results.  These logical functions are difficult to implement and manipulate with procedural languages (e. g. C + +). so the use of a logic engine provides significant technical benefits.  This diagnostic logic version of CliniMetrica is referred to as ""CliniMetrica-Dx.""  To assist raters in thorough examination and to support adaptive assessment, a user interface coupled to logic processing modules will allow tracking the diagnostic status of a subject (the sets of true, false, partially true, or partially false DSM-IV and lCD-10 diagnoses during assessment.  The logic engine will dynamically generate assessment item subsets (currently from the SCAN) needed to rule-in or rule-out DSM-IV and lCD-10 diagnoses. During the assessment, presentation of these symptom sets to the assessor can further guide the interview. By narrowing the ""search space,"" the efficiency of assessments will be increased. By formalizing the search, reliability and validity can be enhanced In addition, to provide support for nosologic research and development, in Phase II the system will include mappings between DSM-IV and lCD-10, and between current and future versions of the DSM and lCD.  The CliniMetrica-Dx system as an application framework will generalize to other clinical psychiatric assessment instruments such as the SCID, to adaptive self-report systems, and to other medical specialties.  It also will have applications for education and training.   n/a",Diagnostic Logic and Adaptive Assessment for Psychiatry,6549963,R43MH066434,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer graphics /printing', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder classification', ' human subject', ' indexing', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' psychometrics']",NIMH,"MEDICAL DECISION LOGIC, INC.",R43,2002,94169,-0.01405037195455235
"Genomic application of suspension array technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The principle of the proposed project is the application of fluorescent microsphere based suspension array technology (SAT) to the cytometry based simultaneous detection of multi analytes.

(b) Development of a test to detect gene translocations and rearragements frequently responsible for malignant transformations. A method based on measuring bead-based hybridization of specific 5' and 3' nucleotide sequences in the vicinity of chromosomal translocation breakpoints would allow large scale screening of leukemias and various types of cancers by the measurement of 5'/3' sequence ratio.

"Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Cytogenetics The goal of this project is to develop innovative digital microscope autofocusing techniques for automated cytogenetics applications.  We propose a novel multi-resolution image analysis approach to focus measurement and detection, based on the recently developed mathematical theory of wavelet transform.  In comparison to currently available single-resolution techniques, the proposed method overcomes their fundamental limitations and promises considerably more accurate, reliable and faster means to compute and determine in-focus image position for image acquisition.  This will significantly increase the ability and efficacy of automated scanning microscope instruments for clinical and cancer cytogenetics applications. In Phase 1 we will investigate the feasibility of the proposed method based on its utilization in fluorescence microscopy.  We will develop and implement the algorithm and software for multi-resolution focus function computation and in-focus position determination.  We will test and evaluate the new method against the current best-performing algorithms by comparing (1) Accuracy; (2)  Range; (3)  Insensitivity to other parameters; and (4)  Speed. If the new approach achieves superior performance, in Phase 2 the technique will be further developed and extended to bright-field microscopy applications.  When fully developed, the new technology will be made available to Applied Imaging (AIC) for integration into the PowerGene cytogenetics automation products. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: As soon as the new techniques are developed and qualified for routine application, they will be made available to AIC for incorporation into the PowerGene product line of cytogenetics automation equipment, both in new systems sold and as an upgrade to existing systems already in use in cytogenetics labs, thus commercializing the technology quickly. n/a",Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Cytogenetics,6443502,R43RR016817,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical automation', ' clinical research', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' cytogenetics', ' digital imaging', ' fluorescence microscopy', ' fluorescent in situ hybridization', ' human data', ' image enhancement', ' image processing', ' mathematical model']",NCRR,"ADVANCED DIGITAL IMAGING RESEARCH, LLC",R43,2002,91727,-0.022942713813268196

For a diverse set of patients, we have achieved an accuracy of 10 ml for endocardial volume, 4% for ejection fraction, and ,2.0 mm for border position. Our processes operates in 4 min.

"Deployment Framework for Medical Imaging Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are many reasons for the relatively slow proliferation of advanced medical image processing methods but a significant reason is the present paradigm for providing access: most applications are still tied to proprietary software and hardware environments that carry significant up-front costs. The ultimate intent of this work is leverage commodity computing technologies to develop an open, extensible framework for deploying medical image processing applications in the heterogeneous, networked computing environment of today. The framework will provide clinicians and researchers access to state-of-the-art image processing applications regardless of their particular computing platform or locally available computing resources connecting them with federated database resources, with high-end computing resources, or even with their colleagues in a peer-to-peer computing environment. The aims for Phase I of this project are: (1) Demonstrate that the framework provides access to image processing applications to an extent that is largely independent of local computing resources. (2) Demonstrate that the framework is general in that the same components can be reused for deploying a wide variety of medical imaging applications. (3) Demonstrate that the framework is customizable both by third-party developers and by end-users allowing power-users to both create and deploy new applications.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6514339,R33CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2002,582434,-0.014251145518430867
"Intelligent Information Systems for Systems Biology DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): Our Center will attack the challenges created by the large quantity of data generated from new high throughput technologies. We have teamed biologists, computer scientists and computational scientists from several Universities to build an experienced and distinguished team. Our first major tool building project will be an Object Oriented Framework for the integration of data and tools for genomics, proteomics, DNA arrays and protein-protein interactions. This tool will follow the data from the source through model building. It will build on existing open source tools such as a data acquisition package from particle physics (ROOT), a public database system (MYSQL or PostgreSQL), statistics tools (""R""), graphics libraries, a variety of software tools that have been developed at ISB and new tools needed for the new technologies. We stress the use of an open source system as a means to build the community, creating a functioning system that can be tailored for research and education. We then propose to augment this system with tools for analysis, visualization and model building. We will use yeast as a model system owing to the wide range of data that it available for it.

"STATISTICAL METHODS FOR RECURSIVELY PARTITIONED TREES   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): This proposed project has       three primary objectives. Objective 1 is to develop improved strategies for          fitting more accurate classification and regression tree (i.e., CART) models.        Objective 2 is to develop a formal framework to allow statistical inference on       tree models. Objective 3 is to develop and distribute public-domain software         that will allow applied data analysts to implement the methods we develop in         the first two objectives. To meet these objectives we will integrate                 statistical and computational machine learning approaches. We believe our work       can have a significant impact in biomedical data analysis by combining the           strengths of statistics for developing objective criteria for model selection        and for providing a framework for assessing and quantifying uncertainty              associated with a model, with the strengths of machine learning for fitting          models to large and complex datasets.                                                                                                                                     n/a",STATISTICAL METHODS FOR RECURSIVELY PARTITIONED TREES,6520234,R01GM061218,"['classification', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' experimental designs', ' human data', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,BARNES-JEWISH HOSPITAL,R01,2002,163400,0.0006666857968460604
"Preserving Privacy in Medical Data Sets Privacy is a fundamental right and needs to be protected.  For health care related d information, there are regulations for disclosure.  These regulations were motivated by the public's concern of breaches of confidentiality that might result in discrimination.  The recent progress in electronic medical record technology, the Internet, and the genetic revolution, together with media reports on violations of privacy have generated increasing interest in this topic.  A common belief is that sensitive information is more easily available with the use of networked computers. Since total lack of disclosure is not realistic, current regulations require that the ""minimal amount"" of information be given to a certain party.  A thorough study on what constitutes ""minimal"" for particular types of applications and a ""usefulness index"" is lacking.  An exact quantification of the potential for privacy breach in de-identified or anonymized databases is also lacking.  Definition and quantification of these indices is important for decision-making.  As we demonstrate, de-identified data sets can still be used for inference and therefore may disclose sensitive information.  The use of machine learning methods to verify the remaining functional dependencies in a de- identified data set leads to better understanding of the possible inferences.  Anonymization techniques based on logic, statistics, database theory, and machine learning methods can help in the protection of privacy. We will formally define and study anonymity in databases, from a theoretical and a practical standpoint.  We will develop and implement algorithms to anonymize data sets that will be in accordance with the balance of anonymity and ""usefulness"" of the disclosed data sets.  We will also develop and implement algorithms to verify the anonymity of a given data set and indicate the type of records that are at highest risk for a privacy attack.

"Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems The high cost of data entry is a critical issue that has challenged the evolution of computerized patient record systems. Development of dynamic language models is proposed for significantly improving the cost performance of medical transcription systems. The innovative use of speech recognition, computer telephony integration, and the Internet is proposed for the management and transcription of physician dictation. Results of Phase I research demonstrate significant cost savings to healthcare organizations. Our goal in Phase II is to apply multiple dynamic language models to both improve accuracy and the robustness of the system. We propose to create a physician specific mapping of historical transcriptions to their spoken counterparts. We then propose to explore different methodologies for building language models for specific physician work-type combinations using a database of processed historical transcriptions based on dictations from over 1,500 physicians. In addition, the output of the recognition system will be processed by a natural language processing engine to transform it into a formatted, styled draft transcription for review and editing by a transcriptionist. Our unique approach integrates seamlessly into a physician's workflow and does not require the alteration of physician work patterns. We expect this research and development will result in a commercially viable transcription system that significantly reduces costs associated with medical transcription. eScription has obtained three paying pilot customers with whom we are working closely with to develop this system. These customers have/will provide eScription with textual data, audio data, and medical transcriptionists who will test the final system. All have expressed a keen interest in becoming corporate partners for Phase III. Two are currently using our prototype system in their production environments today. We are submitting this grant request to partially cover the cost of constructing and testing the system. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: eScription focuses on alleviating significant healthcare cost pressures associated with transcription of medical dictation. We apply new technologies such as speech recognition, computer telephony and Internet communications, which are not commonly used for medical transcription.

"AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY Molecular microscopy has become an increasingly important tool for structural biology but the methodology is very labor intensive and very slow.  It is generally recognized that the development of improved capabilities for three-dimensional electron microscopy are critical for progress in emerging integrative research in molecular cell biology.  We aim to develop a system for rapid routine structure determination of macromolecular assemblies.  Our ultimate goal is to develop an integrated system that can produce a three-dimensional electron density map of a structure within a few hours of inserting a specimen in the electron microscope.  The motivation for this work is to provide answers to interesting biological questions. We will initially use our work on motor-microtubule complexes and actomyosin as the driver for the development of the integrated system.  By tightly coupling the development of the new system with its implementation in a laboratory whose primary goal is answering fundamental questions in cell biology, we will obtain immediate and invaluable feedback as to how the system is used in practice. Developing this system will involve devising new approaches and integrating the results of several ongoing research projects. The primary specific aims are:  (1) To remove the requirement for using film to acquire the high magnification electron micrographs.  This will require the development of feature recognition algorithms and new imaging strategies that take into account the characteristics of currently available digital cameras.  (2) Improve and automate our existing software for helical image analysis.  We will incorporate new methods for determining the helical parameters of an unknown specimen, methods for improving the resolution, and methods for analyzing non-helical specimens.  (3) Integration of the acquisition and the analysis steps.  This will require incorporation of machine learning techniques to produce a system that is highly efficient in terms of throughput and data quality. The general framework for integrated acquisition and analysis to be developed will be readily extendible to other specimens (helical tubes, single particles, two-dimensional crystals). Thus, once the system has been successfully implemented it will be made generally available to the scientific community.  The system we plan to develop has the potential to revolutionize the field of three-dimensional electron microscopy and make this approach accessible to a wide community.  n/a",AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY,6520333,R01GM061939,"['actins', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' digital imaging', ' electron density', ' electron microscopy', ' image processing', ' microtubules', ' myosins', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2002,363261,-0.009509631704842005
"LANDMARK BASED METHODS FOR BIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SHAPE   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): Morphometric tools developed        under this grant combine techniques from geometry, computer vision, statistics,      and biomathematics in powerful new strategies for analysis of data about size        and shape. This fourth funding period is directed to three extensions of the         established core methodology, along with continued dissemination. Aim 1.             Thin-plate spline interpolant aids the scientist's eye in detecting                  localization of interesting shape differences. Over the present funding period       the applicants reported having developed an algebraic/statistical formalization      of this tactic, the method of creases. Aim 1 of the renewal is to standardize        the parameterization of this feature, to provide protocols for significance          tests, and to produce ""a grammar of grids"" for uniting multiple creases into         coherent summaries of empirical deformations. Aim 2. The standard Procrustes         methods for discrete point landmarks have been extended for data sets of             outlines. Aim 2 of the renewal is to further extend these tools for realistic        data sets that combine discrete point landmarks and curves or surfaces               arbitrarily. The applicants proposed to formalize statistical spaces for such        structures and extend them to anticipate the emerging resource of neural tract       directional data (directions without curves). Aim 3. The best current                strategies for formal statistical inferences about shape exploit permutation         tests of Procrustes distance or its modifications. Under new Aim 3, the              applicants proposed to combine this approach with spline-based high-pass or          low-pass filters and extend it further to support studies of correlations of         shape with other measurement sets, including other aspects of shape. Finally,        as it has been for the past twelve years, Aim 4 is to continue bringing all          these methodological developments to the attention of many different biomedical      communities, by primary scientific papers, essays on methodology per se,             videotapes, and software and documentation free over the Internet. The work          proposed is expected to extend to the medical imaging community's most               sophisticated data resources, carefully labeled images and volumes, a                state-of-the-art biometric toolkit for analysis and visualization carefully          tuned to the special needs of such data.                                                                                                                                  n/a",LANDMARK BASED METHODS FOR BIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SHAPE,6525584,R01GM037251,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cardiovascular system', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' craniofacial', ' human data', ' image processing', ' mathematical model', ' morphology', ' neuroanatomy', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2002,128860,-0.006615034385447328

"Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Exact Logistic Regression   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Logistic regression is a very popular           model for the analysis of binary data with widespread applicability in the           physical, behavioral and biomedical sciences. Parameter inference for this           model is usually based on maximizing the unconditional likelihood function.          However unconditional maximum likelihood inference can produce inconsistent          point estimates, inaccurate p-values and inaccurate confidence intervals for         small or unbalanced data sets and for data sets with a large number of               parameters relative to the number of observations. Sometimes the method fails        entirely as no estimates can be found that maximize the unconditional                likelihood function. A methodologically sound alternative approach that has          none of the aforementioned drawbacks is the exact conditional approach in which      one generates the permutation distributions of the sufficient statistics for         the parameters of interest conditional on fixing the sufficient statistics of        the remaining nuisance parameters at their observed values. The major stumbling      block to this approach is the heavy computational burden it imposes. Monte           Carlo methods attempt to overcome this problem by sampling from the reference        set of possible permutations instead of enumerating them all. Two competing          Monte Carlo methods are network based sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo          (MCMC) sampling. Network sampling suffers from memory limitations while MCMC         sampling can produce incorrect results if the Markov chain is not ergodic or if      the process is not in the steady state. We propose a novel approach which            combines the network and MCMC sampling, draws upon the strengths of each of          them and overcomes their individual limitations. We propose to implement this        hybrid network-MCMC method in our LogXact software and as an external procedure      in the SAS system.

Our LogXact package is the only software that  can provide exact inference for data sets which are not ""toy problems"".  Yet even  LogXact quickly breaks down on moderate sized problems.  The new generation of hybrid  network-MCMC algorithms will handle substantially larger problems that nevertheless need  exact inference.  The commercial potential is considerable since such data sets are common  in scientific studies.                                                                                      n/a",Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Exact Logistic Regression,6404971,R43CA093112,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' mathematics', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,CYTEL SOFTWARE CORPORATION,R43,2001,113111,0.006134324188095091

"Simulation Algorithms for Spatial Pattern Recognition   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A new generation of satellites is imaging       the earth's surface with unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution. With         the ability to identify local features related to environmental exposures, this      high-resolution imagery is gong to revolutionize health risk assessment. The         realization of this potential depends critically on our ability to recognize         spatial patterns on these large images. This project will develop fast spatial       null models for use in statistical pattern recognition, and will accomplish 4        aims.

The phase 1 research will address the first two aims; aims three and four will       be accomplished in phase 2 once feasibility is demonstrated. The technologic         and scientific innovations from this project are expected to greatly enhance         our ability to extract knowledge from high resolution imagery.                       PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The imminent launch of over a dozen satellites capable of high-resolution imagery is giving  health researchers powerful new data for relating environmental features to health   outcomes, but existing software packages cannot undertake spatial analysis of these  extraordinarly large data sets.   The fast simulation algorithms from this research will  be incorporated into 2 commercial software packages, providing advanced spatial  analysis for large imagery.                                                                                     n/a",Simulation Algorithms for Spatial Pattern Recognition,6401389,R43CA092807,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' image processing', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,BIOMEDWARE,R43,2001,170490,-0.014265224169213987
"Functional Genomics Software   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): A substantial commercial potential exists        for software tools that allow a biomedical research scientist to use genomic         data to form experimentally testable hypotheses. These will be used to exploit       genomic sequence data to understand the aetiology of disease, to improve             diagnostic tools, and to develop more effective therapies. The Master Catalog,       a commercial product developed jointly by EraGen Biosciences and the Benner          laboratory at the University of Florida, provides a convenient framework for         implementing heuristics that do this. The Master Catalog is a naturally              organized database that contains evolutionary trees, multiple sequence               alignments, and reconstructed evolutionary intermediates for all of the              proteins in the GenBank database. The Benner laboratory has developed and            anecdotally tested heuristics that date events in the molecular history,             provide evidence for and against functional recruitment within a protein             family, detect distant homologs, associate individual residues important for         functional changes with a crystal structure, find metabolic and regulatory           pathways, and correlate events in the molecular record with the history of life      on Earth. This Phase I proposal seeks to validate a set of these heuristics          more broadly to determine their suitability for database-wide application. In        Phase II, we will implement these within the Master Catalog, and launch a            commercial bioinformatics product to support functional analysis of genomic          databases.                                                                           PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  In its present version, the Master Catalog is a successful commercial product within a  niche: ""best in class"" of bioinformatics databases.  Adding a validated set of heuristics  for extracting functional information from genome databases will make it the software  of choice for most functional genomics work, and be a central tool in the pharmaceutical/  biotechnology industries.  Academic versions and student versions will find markets in most  universities.                                                                                      n/a",Functional Genomics Software,6337786,R41HG002331,"['artificial intelligence', ' biochemical evolution', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' functional /structural genomics', ' informatics', ' molecular biology information system', ' nucleic acid sequence']",NHGRI,"ERAGEN BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R41,2001,96855,-0.03179230353638894
"Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System A cancer genetics-tracking database will be redesigned using usability engineering techniques to improve the functionality and usability of the current system. This is important because it will lead to a system that is easier to use and learn, will decrease the chance of errors, and will increase productivity, and user satisfaction. The current state of informatics offers the potential for the creation of tools to assist in the reduction of medical errors. The redesign of this tracking database will be completed through a three-phase process. The first phase will use the results of a usability analysis to redesign and prototype the cancer genetics-tracking database. In the second phase, usability studies will then be conducted to ensure that the system is functional, easy to use, easy to learn, and meets the goals of the users. The usability studies will include heuristic evaluations, keystroke level models, talk-aloud methods, and cognitive walkthrough techniques. The system will be modified based upon the results of these studies. Research will be compiled on the advantages and disadvantages of ICD coding Vs. SNOMED followed by the selection of the most useful system for coding medical information. In the third phase the final redesign will be compared to the old system using a within-subject design to determine if the redesign decreases the error rate, increases productivity, and user satisfaction. This will be followed-up with a survey to determine the perceived usability of the redesigned application. Throughout the redesign process, specific usability guidelines will be developed for designing healthcare software that is computational and knowledge- based in nature.  n/a",Applying Usability to A Knowledge Based System,6340157,F38LM007188,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer information system', ' cancer registry /resource', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' family genetics', ' human data', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,F38,2001,68753,-0.014312193709679727
"Inference in Regression Models with Missing Covariates DESCRIPTION:  (Adapted from investigator's abstract) This project will examine new methodology for making inference about the regression parameters in the presence of missing covariate data for two commonly used classes of regression models.  In particular, we examine the class of generalized linear models for general types of response data and the Cox model for survival data.  The methodology addresses problems occurring frequently in clinical investigations for chronic disease, including cancer and AIDS.  The specific objectives of the project are to:  1) develop and study classical and Bayesian methods of inference for the class of generalized linear models (GLM's) in the presence of missing covariate data.  In particular, we will  i) examine methods for estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is ignorable.  Also, parametric models for the covariate distribution will be examined.  The methods of estimation will focus on the Monte Carlo version of the EM algorithm (Wei and Tanner, 1990) and other related iterative algorithms.  The Gibbs sampler (Gelfand and Smith, 1990) along with the adaptive rejection algorithm of Gilks and Wild (1992) will be used to sample from the conditional distribution of the missing covariates given the observed data.  ii) examine estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is nonignorable.  Models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  iii) develop and study Bayesian methods of inference in the presence of missing covariate data when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is ignorable.  Parametric prior distributions for the regression coefficients are proposed.  Properties of the posterior distributions of the regression coefficients will be studied.  The methodology will be implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods similar to those of Tanner and Wong (1987). iv) investigate Bayesian methods when the covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanism is nonignorable.  Multinomial models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  Dirichlet prior distributions for the multinomial parameters will be investigated.  2) develop and study classical and Bayesian methods of inference for the Cox model for survival outcomes in the presence of missing covariates.  Specifically, we will  i) develop and study estimation methods for the Cox model for survival outcomes in the presence of missing covariates. Methods for estimating the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous will be studied.  The methods of estimation will focus on an EM type algorithm similar to that of Wei and Tanner (1990).  ii) study estimation of the regression parameters when the missing covariates are either categorical or continuous and the missing data mechanisms nonignorable.  Models for the missing data mechanism will be studied.  Bayesian methods similar to those of 1-iii) and -iv) will be investigated. Computational techniques using the Monte Carlo methods described in 1-iii) will be implemented.  n/a",Inference in Regression Models with Missing Covariates,6326240,R01CA074015,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer data analysis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' human data', ' mathematical model', ' method development', ' model design /development', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE,R01,2001,183883,-0.0003992218652051992
"KNOWLEDGED BASED SYSTEMS FOR DIAGNOSTIC HISTOPATHOLOGY  The proposed work extends previous research performed by this                                                                     investigator in the field of knowledge-based systems for the analysis of             histopathologic material, mainly neoplastic tissue; and mostly focusing on           adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The present application concerns the creation        of methods for the definition and analysis of novel histopathologic features         predominantly derived from nuclear image data, with the objective of defining        ""prototype identities."" According to the investigator, these are fundamental         complexes of histologic features unique to individual tissue samples, or small       groups of such samples, that should convey useful predictive value for               individual patients. Many of these features are not normally discernable to the      eye, even to the experienced observer. They encompass a large number of primary      and derived nuclear morphometric measures, including what are referred to as         ""weak features,"" that is those that have not in the past shown strong                correlative utility by standard statistical measures. Derived measures include       feature and heterogeneity profiles.

"Nosocomial infections: Automated typing and data mining   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nosocomial infections cause about 90,000        deaths annually in the U.S. and have an associated medical care cost of about        3.5 billion dollars. Despite being the fourth leading cause of death, there has      been limited development of rapid, integrated tools for determination of             outbreaks of hospital-acquired infections. The goal of the proposed research is      to test feasibility of development of software algorithms for identifying            clusters of bacteria involved in nosocomial infections. This will be                 accomplished by creation of new algorithms for clustering bacterial fatty acid       composition data to detect infection clusters and through the creation of a          ""data mining"" algorithm to provide patient demographic information needed to         distinguish nosocomial outbreaks from community-acquired infections or               pseudo-outbreaks. These software algorithms will be integrated into the MIDI         Sherlock Microbial Identification System as a fully automated real-time              epidemiology tool. Hospital infection-control personnel will be able to use the      output to immediately implement infection control measures, and thus to reduce       the impact of nosocomial infections.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6467733,R33CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R33,2001,607570,-0.014251145518430867

"PARALLEL SIMULATION OF LARGE SCALE NEURONAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  Over the last decade             computational modeling has become central to neurobiology.  While much of        this work has focused on cellular and sub-cellular processes, the last few       years have seen increasing interest in systems level models and in               integrative accounts that span data from the subcellular to behavioral           levels.  Our proposal, in summary, is to extend existing work in parallel        discrete event simulation (PDES) and integrate it with existing work on          compartmental modeling environments, to produce a software environment which     has comprehensive support for modeling large scale, highly structured            networks of biophysically realistic cells; and which can efficiently exploit     the full range of parallel platforms, including the largest parallel             supercomputers, for simulation of these network models, which integrate          information about the nervous system from sub-cellular to the whole-brain        level.  Because of the scale of the models needed at this level of               integration, advanced parallel computing is required.  The critical              technical insight upon which this work rests is that neuronal modeling at        the systems level can often be reduced to a form of discrete event               simulation in which single cells are node functions and voltage spikes are       events.                                                                                                                                                           Three neuroscience modeling projects, will mold, test, and utilize these new     capabilities in investigations of system-level models of the nervous system      which integrate behavioral, anatomical and physiological data on a scale         that exceeds current simulation capabilities.  In collaboration with             computer scientists at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and UCLA,                neuroscientists at University of Virginia, the Born-Bunge Foundation,            Antwerp, and the Salk Institute, and developers of the NEURON and GENESIS        packages, these tools will be developed and made available to the                neuroscience community.  The software development aims include 1)                investigation of a portable, PDES system capable of running efficiently on       diverse parallel platforms, 2) development of interfaces to the PDES for         NEURON and GENESIS allowing models developed in those packages to be scaled      up, 3) investigation of a network specification language for neuronal            models, and associated a visualization interface, to facilitate                  investigation of systems-level models, 4) sufficiently robust and                well-documented software for download and installation at other sites.  The      three neuroscience projects will guide development of the software tools and     use the tools for investigation of large-scale models of cerebellum,             hippocampus and thalamocortical circuits.                                         n/a",PARALLEL SIMULATION OF LARGE SCALE NEURONAL MODELS,6392266,R01MH057358,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical automation', ' biotechnology', ' cerebellar cortex', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer network', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' hippocampus', ' mathematical model', ' neural information processing', ' neurotransmitters', ' parallel processing', ' supercomputer', ' thalamocortical tract', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,232139,-0.007815950385812067
"RULE DISCOVERY IN BODY CAVITY EFFUSIONS  DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                             Machine learning methods are innovative tools used to find patterns in medical       data.  Laboratory data is suited to computerized Interpretation because of its       objective, quantitative nature.  Body fluid analysis is a good model for             evaluating machine learning in the laboratory.  Pathologists spend a                 substantial amount of time analyzing and classifying body fluids, or                 effusions, which are abnormal accumulations of fluid within body cavities of         human beings and animals, caused by diseases such as congestive heart failure.       Fluid classification provides clinicians with important diagnostic information       about the underlying disease process.  Automation of body fluid analysis by a        machine learning system would substantially increase the efficiency and              profitability of a medical laboratory.  In a pilot study, RIPPER (Repeated           Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction), a rule discovery tool,              accurately classified effusions from animals into five standard categories,          based on the physical, chemical, and cellular characteristics of the fluid.          The purposes of this study are: 1) to determine the accuracy of RIPPER on a          larger data set, to expand and strengthen the results of the pilot; 2) to test       the accuracy of RIPPER's fluid classifications prospectively in a large              veterinary teaching hospital laboratory, 3) to determine the acceptance rate         or reason for rejection of RIPPER's classification by clinical pathologists;         and (4) to use RIPPER to discover novel rules for classifying effusions by           underlying disease process.                                                                                                                                               The results of this study will validate and test the acceptance of a machine         learning system applicable to fluid analysis in both human and veterinary            clinical laboratories.  By discovering new patterns in quantitative data that        identify the specific underlying disease, RIPPER can greatly enhance the             diagnostic value of laboratory analysis.                                                                                                                                  n/a",RULE DISCOVERY IN BODY CAVITY EFFUSIONS,6467346,F32LM000095,"['body fluids', ' classification', ' computer assisted instruction', ' programmed instruction', ' veterinary science']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS,F32,2001,52501,-0.008464662747397222

This tool will follow the data from the source through model building. It will build on existing open source tools such as a data acquisition package from particle physics (ROOT), a public database system (MYSQL or PostgreSQL), statistics tools (""R""), graphics libraries, a variety of software tools that have been developed at ISB and new tools needed for the new technologies. We stress the use of an open source system as a means to build the community, creating a functioning system that can be tailored for research and education. We then propose to augment this system with tools for analysis, visualization and model building. We will use yeast as a model system owing to the wide range of data that it available for it.

"STATISTICAL METHODS FOR RECURSIVELY PARTITIONED TREES   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): This proposed project has       three primary objectives. Objective 1 is to develop improved strategies for          fitting more accurate classification and regression tree (i.e., CART) models.        Objective 2 is to develop a formal framework to allow statistical inference on       tree models. Objective 3 is to develop and distribute public-domain software         that will allow applied data analysts to implement the methods we develop in         the first two objectives. To meet these objectives we will integrate                 statistical and computational machine learning approaches. We believe our work       can have a significant impact in biomedical data analysis by combining the           strengths of statistics for developing objective criteria for model selection        and for providing a framework for assessing and quantifying uncertainty              associated with a model, with the strengths of machine learning for fitting          models to large and complex datasets.                                                                                                                                     n/a",STATISTICAL METHODS FOR RECURSIVELY PARTITIONED TREES,6387141,R01GM061218,"['classification', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' experimental designs', ' human data', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,BARNES-JEWISH HOSPITAL,R01,2001,163400,0.0006666857968460604

We recently performed an analysis of         the user responsiveness to allergy alerts, and found that it was lower than          expected (50% in 1994); moreover it had been declining for several years (to         20% in 1999).                                                                                                                                                             In our analysis, we learned several lessons. One is that the allergy screening       software may be too richly cross-referenced, and therefore generates excessive       alerts. In addition, some allergy alerts are consistently ignored based on           accepted clinical practice, but their importance has not been tested. Also,          present systems lack stratification of allergy severity, and fail to                 distinguish between medication tolerance and true allergies. By over-alerting,       the overall integrity of the system is degraded.                                                                                                                          We seek to improve the computer-based intelligence of the allergy alerting           process. Our study is designed to accomplish several goals. We will evaluate         the frequency and significance of adverse drug events that resulted from             overridden allergy alerts. Next, we will determine if distinguishing true            allergic reactions from symptoms of medication intolerance will result in            improved compliance to allergy alerts. Finally, we aim to design an allergy          classification system that incorporates severity analysis that would otherwise       be performed off-line by pharmacist oversight.                                                                                                                            We believe the results of our work will improve patient safety and the overall       quality of pharmacotherapy. We also believe that the results of our study will       be applicabe to other healthcare systems                                                                                                                                  n/a",Allergy Alerts in Computerized Physician Entry,6360744,R01LM007203,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' chemical information system', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer data analysis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' drug administration rate /duration', ' drug adverse effect', ' health care personnel performance', ' health care quality', ' health care service evaluation', ' health services research tag', ' human data', ' hypersensitivity', ' informatics', ' patient oriented research', ' patient safety /medical error', ' pharmacology', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2001,140093,-0.019676575626958778
"Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems The high cost of data entry is a critical issue that has challenged the evolution of computerized patient record systems. Development of dynamic language models is proposed for significantly improving the cost performance of medical transcription systems. The innovative use of speech recognition, computer telephony integration, and the Internet is proposed for the management and transcription of physician dictation. Results of Phase I research demonstrate significant cost savings to healthcare organizations. Our goal in Phase II is to apply multiple dynamic language models to both improve accuracy and the robustness of the system. We propose to create a physician specific mapping of historical transcriptions to their spoken counterparts. We then propose to explore different methodologies for building language models for specific physician work-type combinations using a database of processed historical transcriptions based on dictations from over 1,500 physicians. In addition, the output of the recognition system will be processed by a natural language processing engine to transform it into a formatted, styled draft transcription for review and editing by a transcriptionist. Our unique approach integrates seamlessly into a physician's workflow and does not require the alteration of physician work patterns. We expect this research and development will result in a commercially viable transcription system that significantly reduces costs associated with medical transcription. eScription has obtained three paying pilot customers with whom we are working closely with to develop this system. These customers have/will provide eScription with textual data, audio data, and medical transcriptionists who will test the final system. All have expressed a keen interest in becoming corporate partners for Phase III. Two are currently using our prototype system in their production environments today. We are submitting this grant request to partially cover the cost of constructing and testing the system. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: eScription focuses on alleviating significant healthcare cost pressures associated with transcription of medical dictation. We apply new technologies such as speech recognition, computer telephony and Internet communications, which are not commonly used for medical transcription. We will directly sell our software products and services to Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and to Transcription Services Companies.  n/a",Dynamic Language Modeling for Transcription Systems,6404288,R44LM006930,"['computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' language', ' medical records', ' speech recognition', ' telemedicine', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,"ESCRIPTION, INC.",R44,2001,673495,-0.06126884360259788

"AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY Molecular microscopy has become an increasingly important tool for structural biology but the methodology is very labor intensive and very slow.  It is generally recognized that the development of improved capabilities for three-dimensional electron microscopy are critical for progress in emerging integrative research in molecular cell biology.  We aim to develop a system for rapid routine structure determination of macromolecular assemblies.  Our ultimate goal is to develop an integrated system that can produce a three-dimensional electron density map of a structure within a few hours of inserting a specimen in the electron microscope.  The motivation for this work is to provide answers to interesting biological questions. We will initially use our work on motor-microtubule complexes and actomyosin as the driver for the development of the integrated system.  By tightly coupling the development of the new system with its implementation in a laboratory whose primary goal is answering fundamental questions in cell biology, we will obtain immediate and invaluable feedback as to how the system is used in practice. Developing this system will involve devising new approaches and integrating the results of several ongoing research projects. The primary specific aims are:  (1) To remove the requirement for using film to acquire the high magnification electron micrographs.  This will require the development of feature recognition algorithms and new imaging strategies that take into account the characteristics of currently available digital cameras.  (2) Improve and automate our existing software for helical image analysis.  We will incorporate new methods for determining the helical parameters of an unknown specimen, methods for improving the resolution, and methods for analyzing non-helical specimens.  (3) Integration of the acquisition and the analysis steps.  This will require incorporation of machine learning techniques to produce a system that is highly efficient in terms of throughput and data quality. The general framework for integrated acquisition and analysis to be developed will be readily extendible to other specimens (helical tubes, single particles, two-dimensional crystals). Thus, once the system has been successfully implemented it will be made generally available to the scientific community.  The system we plan to develop has the potential to revolutionize the field of three-dimensional electron microscopy and make this approach accessible to a wide community.  n/a",AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY,6484619,R01GM061939,"['actins', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' digital imaging', ' electron density', ' electron microscopy', ' image processing', ' microtubules', ' myosins', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2001,337739,-0.009509631704842005
"LANDMARK BASED METHODS FOR BIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SHAPE   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): Morphometric tools developed        under this grant combine techniques from geometry, computer vision, statistics,      and biomathematics in powerful new strategies for analysis of data about size        and shape. This fourth funding period is directed to three extensions of the         established core methodology, along with continued dissemination. Aim 1.             Thin-plate spline interpolant aids the scientist's eye in detecting                  localization of interesting shape differences. Over the present funding period       the applicants reported having developed an algebraic/statistical formalization      of this tactic, the method of creases. Aim 1 of the renewal is to standardize        the parameterization of this feature, to provide protocols for significance          tests, and to produce ""a grammar of grids"" for uniting multiple creases into         coherent summaries of empirical deformations. Aim 2. The standard Procrustes         methods for discrete point landmarks have been extended for data sets of             outlines. Aim 2 of the renewal is to further extend these tools for realistic        data sets that combine discrete point landmarks and curves or surfaces               arbitrarily. The applicants proposed to formalize statistical spaces for such        structures and extend them to anticipate the emerging resource of neural tract       directional data (directions without curves). Aim 3. The best current                strategies for formal statistical inferences about shape exploit permutation         tests of Procrustes distance or its modifications. Under new Aim 3, the              applicants proposed to combine this approach with spline-based high-pass or          low-pass filters and extend it further to support studies of correlations of         shape with other measurement sets, including other aspects of shape. Finally,        as it has been for the past twelve years, Aim 4 is to continue bringing all          these methodological developments to the attention of many different biomedical      communities, by primary scientific papers, essays on methodology per se,             videotapes, and software and documentation free over the Internet. The work          proposed is expected to extend to the medical imaging community's most               sophisticated data resources, carefully labeled images and volumes, a                state-of-the-art biometric toolkit for analysis and visualization carefully          tuned to the special needs of such data.                                                                                                                                  n/a",LANDMARK BASED METHODS FOR BIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SHAPE,6385653,R01GM037251,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cardiovascular system', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' craniofacial', ' human data', ' image processing', ' mathematical model', ' morphology', ' neuroanatomy', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2001,127154,-0.006615034385447328
"ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC LOGIC FOR PSYCHIATRY   DESCRIPTION: (Verbatim from the Applicant's Abstract): This Phase I project          proposes to assess the feasibility of an advanced diagnostic logic system            (Diagnostica) to support the clinical assessment process for diagnosis in            psychiatry. A working prototype of the diagnostic rules in the American              Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) uses and          artificial intelligence engine (""XSB"") to implement the logic of DSM-IV along        with and an interactive graphical user interface to allow a user to add              information and understand conclusions reached by the system. The Phase I            programming objectives are to make Diagnostica ready for commercial use by           improving its graphical user interface, and finalizing implementation of its         logical rules. The resulting system will be a practical tool in clinical             settings, and relies on computer science innovations that have preciously            neither been explored nor applied in the domain of medical reasoning. With the       emergence of decision support systems, the need for better quality diagnostic        information is becoming increasingly apparent. This has been due, in part, to        the complexity of diagnostic processes and the emphasis on support of financial      processes. Within mental health, the DSM-IV provides both a model and a              standard for making diagnoses. A software component that provides flexible,          complete, and efficient application of this standard is of great value. The          innovation of Diagnostica relies on the sophistication of its modeling of            DSM-IV rules, and it's flexibility in applying those rules. Diagnostica will         automatically track the status of the information entered and allow users to         tie up 'loose ends' in documenting the proof of diagnoses formally. AS example,      the user may indicate that a set of diagnoses in 'believed true' without             specifying the symptoms needed to make the diagnoses formally ( a procedure          used routinely in clinical practice). the application will track whatever            'residual' data this is necessary in order to complete formal diagnoses, while       leaving the option of when, or if, to complete the process up to the user.                                                                                                Phase II objectives include: (1) extending Diagnostica to provide other              software applications needing diagnostic decision support services, and              specifically to link Diagnostica to the World Health Organization Schedules for      Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN); (2) addressing logical modeling       of time and creating an effective user interface for repeated assessment; (3)        incorporating probabilistic information about sets of symptoms based on              empirical information initially obtained in Phase I; and (4) developing and          testing ""belief revision"" functions to changes in knowledge stemming from            repeated clinical assessment.

"SELECTING AMONG MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF COGNITION DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract):  In mathematical modeling       of cognition, it is important to have well-justified criteria for choosing       among differing explanations (i.e., models) of observed data.  This project      investigates those criteria as well as their instantiation in five model         selection methods.

Comprehensive              simulations re intended to determine complexity's contribution to model fit      and to model selection.  An analytical solution will also be sought with the     hope of quantifying model complexity.

"IMPROVED COLLIMATION FOR PIXELATED RADIATION DETECTORS   DESCRIPTION: The investigators propose to test the feasibility of developing         improved collimators for use with higher performance pixelated detectors under       development for use in gamma cameras now under development, as further               described by their abstract:                                                                                                                                              ""In nuclear medicine, the collimator plays a critical role in the formation of       a projection image of the radiopharmaceutical distribution within a patient.         The current state-of-the-art of collimator design for Nuclear Medicine has           matured, under the assumption that gamma-ray detectors have an intrinsic             position dependant Gaussian response function. A fundamental rethinking of           collimator design is necessary to optimize collimation for solid state               detectors that have a fixed intrinsic rect function response. We will construct      design tools by first developing a mathematical model of collimation for             detectors with intrinsic pixels and then implement it by computer algorithms.

"KNOWLEDGE BASED TEMPORAL ABSTRACTION OF CLINICAL DATA Abstractions of time-stamped clinical data are useful for planning               therapy, for monitoring therapy, and for creating high-level summaries of        time-oriented clinical databases.  Temporal abstractions also support            explanations by an intelligent patient-record system and can be used for         representation of the goals and intentions of clinical guidelines and            protocols.                                                                                                                                                        We propose to reengineer and expand the scope of the RESUME system, a            prototype computer program that implements the knowledge-based temporal-         abstraction method, a conceptual and computational framework that we have        developed for abstraction of time-stamped clinical data into clinically          meaningful interval-based concepts. RESUME has been evaluated with highly        encouraging results in several clinical areas. We will address the               practical and theoretical issues of representation, acquisition,                 maintenance, and reuse of temporal-abstraction knowledge. Our specific           aims are defined by a four-step research plan:                                                                                                                    1. We will define formally the knowledge requirements for five                   computational modules (mechanisms) we employ, thus facilitating the              acquisition, maintenance, reuse, and sharing of the required knowledge.                                                                                           2. We will enhance, expand, and redesign five computational temporal-            abstraction mechanisms:                                                          (a) Automatic formation of meaningful contexts for interpretation of             clinical data.                                                                   (b) Classification of clinical data that have equivalent time stamps into        higher-level concepts.                                                           (c) Temporal inference (e.g., the join of certain interval-based clinical        abstractions into longer ones).                                                  (d) Interpolation between temporally disjoint clinical abstractions,             including a development of a probabilistic representation and semantics.         (e) Matching of predefined and runtime temporal patterns, given time-            stamped data and conclusions.                                                                                                                                     3. We will develop a tool for automated acquisition, from expert                 physicians, of temporal-abstraction knowledge, using techniques from the         PROTEGE-II project for designing knowledge-based systems.                                                                                                         4. We will validate and evaluate our methodology and its implementation.         (a) We will assess the value of the knowledge-acquisition tool in several        experiments.                                                                     (b) We will validate the performance of the computational mechanisms in          the domain of therapy of patients who have insulin-dependent diabetes by         collaboration with expert endocrinologists.

"WAVELET-BASED AUTOMATED CHROMOSOME IDENTIFICATION Commercial automated karyotyping instruments have improved to the point where the major factor limiting throughput is the time required for operator correction of chromosome classification errors. An improvement in chromosome classification accuracy would significantly increase the value of these instruments in cytogenetics labs. The goal of this project is to develop and commercialize significantly improved chromosome measurement and classification techniques for automated karyotyping. Currently the best-performing chromosome classification approach uses Weighted Density Distribution (WDD) features [11] to quantify the banding pattern of the chromosomes. These are computed as inner products between the banding profile and a set of WDD basis functions. The particular set of 1unctions originally proposed by Granum [11,38] has come into widespread use. In Phase I we showed that better function sets exist and that our new approach can find better WDD features than the best currently used. We have an innovative wavelet-based method for generating WDD functions and a chromosome classification testbed which supports large scale classification experiments. We propose to conduct a thorough, methodical search for better performing basis functions in Phase II. Phase III will incorporate the technology into PSI's PowerGene automated karyotyping instruments. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: When the new chromosome classification technology is qualified for routine application, it will be incorporated into PSI's Powergene products, both in new systems sold and as an upgrade to existing systems.  n/a",WAVELET-BASED AUTOMATED CHROMOSOME IDENTIFICATION,6173267,R44CA076896,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosomes', ' computer program /software', ' cytogenetics', ' density', ' genetic mapping', ' genetic techniques', ' human genetic material tag', ' human tissue', ' image processing']",NCI,"ADVANCED DIGITAL IMAGING RESEARCH, LLC",R44,2000,366807,-0.004996184866611741
"PERMUTATION TEST SOFTWARE FOR RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS The randomized clinical trial (RCT) is arguably the linchpin of the drug development process, and the results of a randomized clinical trial are almost always analyzed using some form of statistical hypothesis test. Most hypothesis tests used for analyzing clinical trials assume a population model for statistical inference, when in fact a randomization model is more consistent with the way randomized clinical trials are actually conducted. Failure to consider the randomization model when analyzing clinical trials can lead to effective drugs being declared ineffective, and ineffective drugs being declared effective. In order to analyze clinical trials in accordance with the randomization model, sophisticated software for conducting permutation tests is needed. The overall goal of this research is to develop flexible and robust software, usable by statisticians or other medical data analysts, for conducting permutation tests for single- or multi-clinic randomized clinical trials. The ongoing advances in computing technology have created a favorable climate for development of software for conducting permutation tests. This project includes a collaboration with Dr. Rosenberger of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County who is a recognized expert on randomization based inference and adaptive designs. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Software that can use general permutation tests to analyze clinical trial data would have clear commercial value to clinical research organizations in academia, Government, and the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. Key applications are the analysis of clinical trials with unusual randomization schemes, trials with unusual patterns of treatment response, and trials where standard distributional assumptions are invalid.  n/a",PERMUTATION TEST SOFTWARE FOR RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS,6141347,R43CA086556,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical trials', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' experimental designs', ' human data', ' mathematics', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,"LINCOLN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2000,98172,-0.009665777932174378
"IMAGE PATTERN BASED WAVELET COMPRESSION FOR RADIOLOGY DESCRIPTION:  The research and development of teleradiology and telemedicine     systems has progressed through many technical and clinical endeavors.  When      dealing with large volume image transmission and storage, image data             compression is an outstanding issue in medical applications to which current     techniques were not designed to address.  The technical objectives of this       project are to develop optimized error-free as well as error-controllable        methods for medical image compression based on wavelet transform and             associated methods.  In this project, we employ both advanced artificial         intelligent and compression techniques to achieve these goals.                                                                                                    Our recent research outcomes include:  (a) development of a mathematics          approach to unify prediction, subband, and wavelet transforms, (b)               development of convolution neural network training methods to obtain             optimized wavelet kernel, (c) development of a data splitting technique to       improve edge accuracy and to provide error-control methods, and (d)              development of an integer implementation method for all wavelet transforms,      etc.  Based on the above technical advances, we propose to use integer form      of an adaptive (optimized) wavelets in conjunction with newly developed          coding methods such as ""partitioning in hierarchical trees"" (PHT) for            lossless compression.  For error-controllable approaches, we propose to use      adaptive wavelets coupled with optimized neural network prediction methods       in this study.  Since lossless compression is a part of the error -              controllable method, both systems can be implemented in the same scheme          which is a breakthrough approach in the field.  We will compare the              compression results (i.e., compression ratio and speed) of the proposed          compression methods with those of the current wavelet techniques using the       embedded zero-tree coding method.  At the end of the project, we will            deliver a software package for the radiological society.  Hence, the             evaluation for various clinical applications using the proposed methods can      be performed by the investigators.                                                                                                                                As the field of telemedicine is rapidly growing, we believe that development     of a dedicated compression module for economical storage and fast                communication of patient data (particularly for patient images) is               necessary.  This project is designed to address the related technical issues     with a strong clinical consideration.                                             n/a",IMAGE PATTERN BASED WAVELET COMPRESSION FOR RADIOLOGY,6173899,R01CA079139,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' charge coupled device camera', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' digital imaging', ' human data', ' image processing', ' radiology', ' telemedicine']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,176034,-0.015406943252223389
"WAVELET ENHANCEMENT OF CHROMOSOME BANDING PATTERNS This project aims to develop and commercialize significantly improved software for digital enhancement of the detail of chromosome banding patterns in microscopic images. These investigators have developed an innovative technique for this application, based upon wavelet transforms and multiresolution image analysis. Used with modern computerized chromosome analysis the proposed technique promises significantly improved enhancement of chromosome banding patterns and more effective visual detection of subtle rearrangements. This will help clinicians and researchers detect previously invisible or sub-visible band pattern alterations in conventional and high resolution banding. It will significantly increase the ability of automated instruments to assist the evaluation of chromosome alterations in clinical samples and in normal and neoplastic mammalian cells. During Phase I we implemented and tested three wavelet transforms with desirable mathematical properties. We developed a prototype multiresolution image processing system for chromosome enhancement. We obtained extremely encouraging results, strongly suggesting that these techniques offer considerably improved enhancement capability over conventional methods. and clearly demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. In Phase II we will complete the implementation and refinement of the software. We will implement several wavelet design approaches and evaluate many wavelet transform basis function sets that potentially can bring out relevant detail in chromosome banding patterns.

"TOOLS TO SUPPORT COMPUTER BASED CLINICAL GUIDELINES DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract):                                                                                                              The proposed research will build, refine, and test in operational use, a set     of software tools designed to help support, maintain, and iteratively            revalidate computer-based clinical guidelines as they evolve over time.  The     project will focus on the domain of childhood immunization, and will build       upon IMM/Serve, a childhood immunization forecasting program that takes as       input a child's immunization history, and produces recommendations as to         which vaccinations are due and which vaccinations should be scheduled next.      The effort required to modify and validate such a program as the clinical        field evolves over time is a challenging task.  It will be extremely             important to have a robust set of tools to assist in this process.  Partial      prototype versions of certain of these tools already exist.                                                                                                       1.  The project will refine and extend computer-based tools for immunization     knowledge maintenance.  These tools will include:  a) IMM/Def, a program         which automatically generates the rule-based logic for the most complex          portion (""kernel"") of IMM/Serve's knowledge, and b) IMM/Test, a program          which automatically generates a set of test cases to help test the kernel        logic.  The project will also develop an organized set of strategies for         immunization test case generation, and implement those strategies in the         refined version of IMM/Test.                                                                                                                                      2.

The project will keep a detailed record of all modifications and             customization of the knowledge, and will represent all the variations of the     knowledge using a standardized format such as GLIF, the Guideline                Interchange Format being developed as a standard for exchanging guidelines       between sites.                                                                                                                                                    4.  The project will link IMM/Serve to a database designed to hold               IMM/Serve's analysis of a set of cases, so that the resulting package can be     used as a tool to perform compliance assessment.                                                                                                                  5.

COMPUTER AIDED CARDIAC MEASUREMENT The objective of the proposed research is to develop a method for providing fast and accurate measurements of volume and ejection fraction from 3D echo images. Our Computer Aided Measurement System will reconstruct the LV endocardium using a few user selected points on oriented echocardiographic images together with prior shape and size knowledge. The Specific Aims for Phase I are: 1. To improve the accuracy of quantitative echo while minimizing manual labor. 2. To improve the ease of use of the prototype system for application in a clinical setting. 3. To expand the catalog representing our knowledge base by acquiring additional large volume and abnormally shaped LV's in order to enhance fitting accuracy for atypical shapes. Previously described methods of analyzing echocardiograms in 3D require so much manual labor that this modality has been limited to research applications. The advantages of our proposed approach are that it makes the superior accuracy and reproducibility of 3D echo available for clinical practice. Furthermore this process will be applicable to other imaging modalities.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project. Performance of the system will he evaluated on real biological samples provided by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results returned by the system will he compared with results of t(14; 18) PCR performed in this department with an ABI PRISM 7700 for the diagnosis of patients suffering from follicular lymphomas.  n/a",AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION,6062376,R21CA084691,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' chromosome translocation', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fluorescence', ' high throughput technology', ' human tissue', ' minimal residual disease', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', "" nonHodgkin's lymphoma"", ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection', ' polymerase chain reaction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2000,154460,-0.014251145518430867

"PARALLEL SIMULATION OF LARGE SCALE NEURONAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  Over the last decade             computational modeling has become central to neurobiology.  While much of        this work has focused on cellular and sub-cellular processes, the last few       years have seen increasing interest in systems level models and in               integrative accounts that span data from the subcellular to behavioral           levels.  Our proposal, in summary, is to extend existing work in parallel        discrete event simulation (PDES) and integrate it with existing work on          compartmental modeling environments, to produce a software environment which     has comprehensive support for modeling large scale, highly structured            networks of biophysically realistic cells; and which can efficiently exploit     the full range of parallel platforms, including the largest parallel             supercomputers, for simulation of these network models, which integrate          information about the nervous system from sub-cellular to the whole-brain        level.  Because of the scale of the models needed at this level of               integration, advanced parallel computing is required.  The critical              technical insight upon which this work rests is that neuronal modeling at        the systems level can often be reduced to a form of discrete event               simulation in which single cells are node functions and voltage spikes are       events.                                                                                                                                                           Three neuroscience modeling projects, will mold, test, and utilize these new     capabilities in investigations of system-level models of the nervous system      which integrate behavioral, anatomical and physiological data on a scale         that exceeds current simulation capabilities.  In collaboration with             computer scientists at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and UCLA,                neuroscientists at University of Virginia, the Born-Bunge Foundation,            Antwerp, and the Salk Institute, and developers of the NEURON and GENESIS        packages, these tools will be developed and made available to the                neuroscience community.  The software development aims include 1)                investigation of a portable, PDES system capable of running efficiently on       diverse parallel platforms, 2) development of interfaces to the PDES for         NEURON and GENESIS allowing models developed in those packages to be scaled      up, 3) investigation of a network specification language for neuronal            models, and associated a visualization interface, to facilitate                  investigation of systems-level models, 4) sufficiently robust and                well-documented software for download and installation at other sites.  The      three neuroscience projects will guide development of the software tools and     use the tools for investigation of large-scale models of cerebellum,             hippocampus and thalamocortical circuits.                                         n/a",PARALLEL SIMULATION OF LARGE SCALE NEURONAL MODELS,6186179,R01MH057358,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical automation', ' biotechnology', ' cerebellar cortex', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer network', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' hippocampus', ' mathematical model', ' neural information processing', ' neurotransmitters', ' parallel processing', ' supercomputer', ' thalamocortical tract', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,234591,-0.007815950385812067
"THREE DIMENSIONAL RECONSTRUCTION OF SYNAPSES DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  Recent advances in               understanding neuronal functions have led to an expanded scientific interest     in defining the organization of the nervous system so the spatial correlates     of these functions can be identified.  This interest has been formalized as      the Human Brain Project, an ambitious multi disciplinary effort to map the       nervous system from the organismal to the macromolecular levels.  One of the     greatest challenges of this effort is to preserve the complex                    three-dimensional relationships that occur between neuronal structures.          This problem will require new methods for data acquisition as well as data       visualization.                                                                                                                                                    The project described here is an interdisciplinary effort to derive              three-dimensional reconstructions of synaptic architecture from stereo           electron micrographs acquired from multiple viewpoints.  The collaboration       combines advanced ultrastructural visualization techniques with massively        parallel computational methods and an innovative set of pattern recognition,     stereo correspondence and depth mapping algorithms.  Our goal is to              integrate structural information from numerous images into a single,             high-accuracy three-dimensional reconstruction of the synaptic cytoskeleton.     The immediate result of this collaboration will be an improved understanding     of the spatial relationships between synaptic macromolecules.  More              importantly, the project will produce a set of computational tools that can      be applied to stereo image data sets of various areas of the nervous system,     from the macroscopic to the molecular level.  Finally, our studies will          advance the state-of-the-art of parallel computation and interactive             reconstruction methods that can provide novel solutions to difficult             problems of neuroscience visualization.                                           n/a",THREE DIMENSIONAL RECONSTRUCTION OF SYNAPSES,6185220,R01LM006326,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' brain mapping', ' cell cell interaction', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' cytoskeleton', ' data collection', ' electron microscopy', ' image processing', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' macromolecule', ' method development', ' nerve endings', ' neurons', ' parallel processing', ' stereophotography', ' structural biology', ' synapses']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2000,117821,-0.007031054010408322
"RULE DISCOVERY IN BODY CAVITY EFFUSIONS  DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):                                             Machine learning methods are innovative tools used to find patterns in medical       data.  Laboratory data is suited to computerized Interpretation because of its       objective, quantitative nature.  Body fluid analysis is a good model for             evaluating machine learning in the laboratory.  Pathologists spend a                 substantial amount of time analyzing and classifying body fluids, or                 effusions, which are abnormal accumulations of fluid within body cavities of         human beings and animals, caused by diseases such as congestive heart failure.       Fluid classification provides clinicians with important diagnostic information       about the underlying disease process.  Automation of body fluid analysis by a        machine learning system would substantially increase the efficiency and              profitability of a medical laboratory.  In a pilot study, RIPPER (Repeated           Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction), a rule discovery tool,              accurately classified effusions from animals into five standard categories,          based on the physical, chemical, and cellular characteristics of the fluid.          The purposes of this study are: 1) to determine the accuracy of RIPPER on a          larger data set, to expand and strengthen the results of the pilot; 2) to test       the accuracy of RIPPER's fluid classifications prospectively in a large              veterinary teaching hospital laboratory, 3) to determine the acceptance rate         or reason for rejection of RIPPER's classification by clinical pathologists;         and (4) to use RIPPER to discover novel rules for classifying effusions by           underlying disease process.                                                                                                                                               The results of this study will validate and test the acceptance of a machine         learning system applicable to fluid analysis in both human and veterinary            clinical laboratories.  By discovering new patterns in quantitative data that        identify the specific underlying disease, RIPPER can greatly enhance the             diagnostic value of laboratory analysis.                                                                                                                                  n/a",RULE DISCOVERY IN BODY CAVITY EFFUSIONS,6144004,F32LM000095,"['body fluids', ' classification', ' computer assisted instruction', ' programmed instruction', ' veterinary science']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS,F32,2000,52420,-0.008464662747397222
"CLASSIFICATION METHODS FOR DETECTING DISEASE LOCI DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract): Bold steps must be       taken to advance our understanding of the genetic and associated co-             variates affecting the inheritance of complex diseases. To that end, this        proposal will develop improved quantitative methods to detect genetic            factors contributing to increased susceptibility to complex disorders and        implement these methods in software for distribution to the research             community.                                                                                                                                                        The methods will concentrate on the use of classification techniques             applied to allele sharing data and other risk factors which affect the           trait. Allele sharing methods for mapping genes will be extended to              include the classification methods known as latent class models, cluster         analysis, and artificial neural networks, as well as a novel use of              logistic regression Co-variates such as gender, parental diagnosis, or           other concomitant factors will be systematically studied through                 applications to both stimulated and existing data sets. An additional goal       is to determine the optimal distribution of relative pairs (e.g. siblings,       first cousins) for these methods. Of great importance to this proposal is        the development of well-documented, user-friendly software and                   documentation which will be distributed to the scientific community via          the Internet. Existing software developed by the PI will be extensively          expanded for latent class models. Existing cluster analysis software will        be modified and combined for ease of use.                                                                                                                         This proposal consists of theoretical exploration, computer simulation,          data analysis, and software development. First, solutions of theoretical         questions relating to classification techniques will be pursued; second,         adaptation of computer programs to implement the analytic methods, and           investigation into alternative research strategies will be accomplished.         The new strategies will be applied to stimulated data, and finally, to           existing data sets of pedigrees in which a complex trait has been                diagnosed. Findings from this research may contribute to the ability to          locate susceptibility loci in complex traits and to the clarification of         those etiological mechanisms responsible for susceptibility.                      n/a",CLASSIFICATION METHODS FOR DETECTING DISEASE LOCI,6168495,R01AA012239,"['alleles', ' analytical method', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomedical resource', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' disease /disorder classification', ' disease /disorder etiology', ' family genetics', ' gene environment interaction', ' gene expression', ' genetic disorder', ' genetic disorder diagnosis', ' genetic mapping', ' genetic markers', ' genetic susceptibility', ' human data', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' quantitative trait loci', ' statistics /biometry']",NIAAA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,180260,-0.025466244229829144
"STATISTICAL METHODS FOR RECURSIVELY PARTITIONED TREES   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): This proposed project has       three primary objectives. Objective 1 is to develop improved strategies for          fitting more accurate classification and regression tree (i.e., CART) models.        Objective 2 is to develop a formal framework to allow statistical inference on       tree models. Objective 3 is to develop and distribute public-domain software         that will allow applied data analysts to implement the methods we develop in         the first two objectives. To meet these objectives we will integrate                 statistical and computational machine learning approaches. We believe our work       can have a significant impact in biomedical data analysis by combining the           strengths of statistics for developing objective criteria for model selection        and for providing a framework for assessing and quantifying uncertainty              associated with a model, with the strengths of machine learning for fitting          models to large and complex datasets.                                                                                                                                     n/a",STATISTICAL METHODS FOR RECURSIVELY PARTITIONED TREES,6090912,R01GM061218,"['classification', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' experimental designs', ' human data', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,BARNES-JEWISH HOSPITAL,R01,2000,214602,0.0006666857968460604
"AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY Molecular microscopy has become an increasingly important tool for structural biology but the methodology is very labor intensive and very slow.  It is generally recognized that the development of improved capabilities for three-dimensional electron microscopy are critical for progress in emerging integrative research in molecular cell biology.  We aim to develop a system for rapid routine structure determination of macromolecular assemblies.  Our ultimate goal is to develop an integrated system that can produce a three-dimensional electron density map of a structure within a few hours of inserting a specimen in the electron microscope.  The motivation for this work is to provide answers to interesting biological questions. We will initially use our work on motor-microtubule complexes and actomyosin as the driver for the development of the integrated system.  By tightly coupling the development of the new system with its implementation in a laboratory whose primary goal is answering fundamental questions in cell biology, we will obtain immediate and invaluable feedback as to how the system is used in practice. Developing this system will involve devising new approaches and integrating the results of several ongoing research projects. The primary specific aims are:  (1) To remove the requirement for using film to acquire the high magnification electron micrographs.  This will require the development of feature recognition algorithms and new imaging strategies that take into account the characteristics of currently available digital cameras.  (2) Improve and automate our existing software for helical image analysis.  We will incorporate new methods for determining the helical parameters of an unknown specimen, methods for improving the resolution, and methods for analyzing non-helical specimens.  (3) Integration of the acquisition and the analysis steps.  This will require incorporation of machine learning techniques to produce a system that is highly efficient in terms of throughput and data quality. The general framework for integrated acquisition and analysis to be developed will be readily extendible to other specimens (helical tubes, single particles, two-dimensional crystals). Thus, once the system has been successfully implemented it will be made generally available to the scientific community.  The system we plan to develop has the potential to revolutionize the field of three-dimensional electron microscopy and make this approach accessible to a wide community.  n/a",AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY,6193019,R01GM061939,"['actins', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' digital imaging', ' electron density', ' electron microscopy', ' image processing', ' microtubules', ' myosins', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2000,478050,-0.009509631704842005
"LANDMARK BASED METHODS FOR BIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SHAPE   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): Morphometric tools developed        under this grant combine techniques from geometry, computer vision, statistics,      and biomathematics in powerful new strategies for analysis of data about size        and shape. This fourth funding period is directed to three extensions of the         established core methodology, along with continued dissemination. Aim 1.             Thin-plate spline interpolant aids the scientist's eye in detecting                  localization of interesting shape differences. Over the present funding period       the applicants reported having developed an algebraic/statistical formalization      of this tactic, the method of creases. Aim 1 of the renewal is to standardize        the parameterization of this feature, to provide protocols for significance          tests, and to produce ""a grammar of grids"" for uniting multiple creases into         coherent summaries of empirical deformations. Aim 2. The standard Procrustes         methods for discrete point landmarks have been extended for data sets of             outlines. Aim 2 of the renewal is to further extend these tools for realistic        data sets that combine discrete point landmarks and curves or surfaces               arbitrarily. The applicants proposed to formalize statistical spaces for such        structures and extend them to anticipate the emerging resource of neural tract       directional data (directions without curves). Aim 3. The best current                strategies for formal statistical inferences about shape exploit permutation         tests of Procrustes distance or its modifications. Under new Aim 3, the              applicants proposed to combine this approach with spline-based high-pass or          low-pass filters and extend it further to support studies of correlations of         shape with other measurement sets, including other aspects of shape. Finally,        as it has been for the past twelve years, Aim 4 is to continue bringing all          these methodological developments to the attention of many different biomedical      communities, by primary scientific papers, essays on methodology per se,             videotapes, and software and documentation free over the Internet. The work          proposed is expected to extend to the medical imaging community's most               sophisticated data resources, carefully labeled images and volumes, a                state-of-the-art biometric toolkit for analysis and visualization carefully          tuned to the special needs of such data.                                                                                                                                  n/a",LANDMARK BASED METHODS FOR BIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SHAPE,6180399,R01GM037251,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cardiovascular system', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' craniofacial', ' human data', ' image processing', ' mathematical model', ' morphology', ' neuroanatomy', ' statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2000,150497,-0.006615034385447328
"Deep learning for population genetics Project Summary The revolution in genome sequencing technologies over the past 15 years has created an explosion of population genomic data but has left in its wake a gap in our ability to make sense of data at this scale. In particular, whereas population genetics as a field has been traditionally data-limited, the massive volume of current sequencing means that previously unanswerable questions may now be within reach. To capitalize on this flood of information we need new methods and modes of analysis.  In the past 5 years the world of machine learning has been revolutionized by the rise of deep neural networks. These so-called deep learning methods offer incredible flexibility as well as astounding improvements in performance for a wide array of machine learning tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. This proposal aims to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference.  In recent years our group has made great strides in using supervised machine learning for population genomic analysis (reviewed in Schrider and Kern 2018). However, this work has focused primarily on using more traditional machine learning methods such as random forests. As we argue in this proposal, DNA sequence data are particularly well suited for modern deep learning techniques, and we demonstrate that the application of these methods can rapidly lead to state-of-the-art performance in very difficult population genetic tasks such as estimating rates of recombination. The power of these methods for handling genetic data stems in part from their ability to automatically learn to extract as much useful information as possible from an alignment of DNA sequences in order to solve the task at hand, rather than relying on one or more predefined summary statistics which are generally problem-specific and may omit information present in the raw data.  In this proposal we lay out a systematic approach for both empowering the field with these tools and understanding their shortcomings. In particular, we propose to design deep neural networks for solving population genetic problems, and incorporate successful networks into user-friendly software tools that will be shared with the community. We will also investigate a variety of methods for estimating the uncertainty of predictions produced by deep learning methods; this area is understudied in machine learning but of great importance to biological researchers who require an accurate measure of the degree of uncertainty surrounding an estimate. Finally, we will explore the impact of training data misspecification—wherein the data used to train a machine learning method differ systematically from the data to which it will be applied in practice. We will devise techniques to mitigate the impact of such misspecification in order to ensure that our tools will be robust to the complications inherent in analyzing real genomic data sets. Together, these advances have the potential to transform the methodological landscape of population genetic inference. Project Narrative Deep learning has revolutionized such disparate fields as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In this proposal we aim to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference. We will design, implement, and apply novel deep learning methods and provide open source software for others to both use and build upon, thereby producing valuable tools for the genetics researchers at large.",Deep learning for population genetics,9976348,R01HG010774,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Floods', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Explosions', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Software Tools', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'empowered', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'stem', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user friendly software']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2020,529154,-0.011931822289858568
"MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems Project Summary Computational toxicology aims to use rules, models and algorithms based on prior data for specific endpoints, to enable the prediction of whether a new molecule will possess similar liabilities or not. Our recent efforts have used sources like PubChem and ChEMBL to build predictive models for different toxicity-related and drug discovery endpoints. Our Phase I SBIR proposal called MegaTox will provide toxicity machine learning models developed with different algorithms for 40-50 in vitro and in vivo toxicity datasets. We propose using this technology to generate machine learning models for predicting potential compounds against either TGF- a target for countering chlorine induced lung inflammation as well as the adenosine A1 receptor to identify agonists as potential anticonvulsants. In addition, we can also compile molecules that can reactivate acetylcholinesterase which would enable the potential to discover medical countermeasures to address nerve agent and pesticide poisoning. We will access multiple machine learning approaches and validate these Bayesian or other machine learning models (including Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth) with our own in-house technology for these selected targets. We will aim for ROC values greater than 0.75 and MCC and F1 scores that are acceptable (>0.3). These models will be used to virtually screen FDA approved drugs, clinical candidates, commercially available drugs or other molecules. We will select up to 50 molecules to be tested using in vitro assays alongside controls for each target. These combined efforts should in the first instance provide commercially viable treatments which will be used to experimentally validate our computational models that can be shared with the medical countermeasures scientific community. In summary, we are proposing to build and validate models for targets based on public databases, select compounds for testing, create proprietary data and use this as a starting point for further optimization of compounds if needed. Our goal is to identify at least one promising compound for each target that we then pursue and protect our IP. We will pursue additional grant funding to take these medical countermeasures through additional in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies. Ultimately, we will license our products to larger companies for development prior to clinical trials. Project Narrative There is an urgent need to develop medical countermeasures (MCM) to address pulmonary agents, nerve agents and organophosphorus pesticides. Our approach leverages public and private data to build machine learning models for different targets involved in the physiological effects of the aforementioned agents. We then use these computational models to select new molecules to test in vitro. Our approach builds on our MegaTox approach focused on modeling toxicology targets to specifically focus on identifying compounds for TGF-β and Adenosine A1 as well as potential AChE reactivators.

"MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions Project Summary The objective of ‘MegaPredict’ is to enable scientists to generate predictions for a natural product (or any molecule) and identify targets for efficacy assessment as well as identify any potential liabilities. We are building on our previous work which has compiled a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and other properties, in a form ready for model building. All of these models utilize the many sources of curated open data, including ChEMBL, ToxCast etc. We have developed a prototype of MegaPredict that utilizes Bayesian algorithm and ECFP6 fingerprints to output a list of prioritized ‘targets’. We realize that neither the algorithm or the descriptors may be optimal therefore we propose to address this as we validate MegaPredict and develop a product over this proposal. Our team is suitably qualified to develop the software needed and we will leverage our large collaborator network to assist us in validating the activity of compounds. We will initially create a script to take a natural product and score it against many thousands of machine learning models then rank the outputs to propose efficacy targets. We will use over 12,000 ChEMBL derived target-assay / bioactivity groups extracted from the ChEMBL v24 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements and other public datasets, using methodology that we have already partially developed. We can repeat this process for over 200 published compounds and access the outputs versus what is known. We intend to compare how the approach performs with synthetic drugs or drug-like compounds as well as natural products. We will assess whether other machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors can improve predictions. As we generate machine learning models such as Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth we will assess the predictions for natural products and compare with the Bayesian approach. We will compare ECFP6 with other 2D, 3D descriptors and physicochemical properties in order to identify the optimal combination for generating predictions for natural products and compare how this differs for synthetic compounds. We will validate our predictions for natural product efficacy assessment. We will work closely with multiple academic groups to generate predictions for at least 20 natural products of interest against over 20 different targets or diseases. Our goal will be to identify potential targets that were previously unknown and then generate in vitro data inhouse or with academic collaborators. Develop a prototype user interface for input of a structure, processing an input molecule and output of prioritized targets and liabilities. We have developed multiple software prototypes (e. Assay Central, MegaTox, etc.) previously and will ensure a user-friendly interface and develop new visualization methods and algorithms for prioritizing potential predicted targets based on the outputs of thousands of machine learning models. In Phase I, we will use the software internally with collaborators to rapidly prototype it. In Phase II we will develop a commercial product, and greatly expand our validation by building a larger network of academic and industry partners that would help to prioritize features of most relevance. Using the machine learning models which we have for natural products is limited because ECFP6 fingerprints cannot distinguish between these very different classes of molecules. But this provides us with an opportunity by going for a ""pharmacophore"" style approach (ideally without using 3D conformations directly). We will therefore focus on developing a ‘3D shape-based fingerprint’ or developing a novel ‘2D fingerprint’ that captures the ‘3D shape’ for natural- and druglike molecules. Currently, the public datasets in ChEMBL and PubChem etc. are made up of mostly druglike molecules, but if we have fingerprints that can compare drug-like and natural product-like molecules then we can likely reliably use our MegaPredict models for natural products as well. We can also attempt to rank natural products with our ChEMBL models or we can look through catalogs of druglike compounds using models derived from natural products. That would be an important innovation. Additionally, in Phase II it would be important to see if we could find uses for natural products with any of the 7000 rare diseases. Developing software that predicts potential natural product drug interactions with various targets could be useful to regulatory organizations as well as the pharmaceutical industry and may broaden utility of being able to more effectively mix natural product and druglike compounds in models will have a profound effect on the value of cheminformatics in this arena. Project Narrative Natural products have long been a source of therapeutics for human healthcare. Yet, some of the challenges with developing natural product treatments are identifying potential human disease related targets and avoiding others that might lead to undesirable natural product-drug interactions. Now there is considerable data in the public domain for millions of molecules with thousands of targets and ADME/T related properties that it is possible to use a suite of machine learning models for prospective prediction and profiling of a molecule’s properties from structure alone. We aim to build on our preliminary efforts to date to create a prototype for MegaPredict using various machine learning models which will enable academic and industrial scientists to generate predictions for a natural product or any molecule of interest and identify potential targets for efficacy and toxicity liability assessment. We will experimentally validate these predictions in-house or through our network of collaborators.",MegaPredict for predicting natural product uses and their drug interactions,10055938,R43AT010585,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Fingerprint', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Natural Product Drug', 'Natural Products', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'commercial application', 'deep neural network', 'drug discovery', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'model building', 'novel', 'open data', 'pharmacophore', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'process repeatability', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'software development', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'symposium', 'synthetic drug', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web-based tool']",NCCIH,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2020,155686,-0.030838591212446656
"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine.

"Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study PROJECT SUMMARY Road traffic injuries are a major contributor to the burden of disease globally with nearly 1.3 million deaths globally and as many as 50 million injured annually with pedestrians and cyclists in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) among the most affected. Road infrastructure of the built environment (e.g., sidewalks), neighborhood design (e.g., street connectivity) and urban development (e.g., urban sprawl) are key determinants of the risk of pedestrian injuries. In LMICs, poor road infrastructure and neighborhood design are acknowledged as being important contributors to rising numbers of road traffic injuries and deaths, but there are few studies systematically identifying and quantifying what specific features of the built environment are contributing to motor vehicle collisions in these settings. Within LMIC cities, there are often large disparities where infrastructure is improved that reflect socioeconomic characteristics, leading to health inequities in road traffic injury. The paucity of georeferenced data on the built environment in LMICs has made research on road traffic injuries more difficult, though recent advances in computer vision and image analysis combined with Big Data of publicly available, georeferenced, images of roads worldwide (e.g., Google Street View, GSV) can help overcome the paucity of data and the cost and time limitations of collecting and analyzing data on the built environment in LMICs. Automated image analysis has largely been made possible via deep learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning and relies on training neural networks to detect and label specific objects within images. These methods can drastically reduce the barriers to citywide built environment and traffic safety research in LMIC cities, thus substantially increasing research capacity and generalizability. My career goal is to become an independent investigator in global urban health with a focus on road safety and the built environment in LMICs. I propose undertaking research and training in deep learning methods applied to public health in the setting of Bogota, Colombia: 1) Develop neural networks to create a database of BE features of the road infrastructure from image data and to create neighborhood typologies from those features; 2) Assess the association between neighborhood-level BE features and typologies and pedestrian collisions and fatalities and road safety perceptions; 3) Assess the association of neighborhood social environment characteristics with pedestrian collision and fatalities, perceptions, and BE features and typologies. I am seeking additional training in 1) developing competency in deep learning methods applied to public health; 2) creating neighborhood indictors and typologies of health and the built environment; 3) applying Bayesian spatiotemporal models to understand how neighborhood characteristics and typologies influence health; 4) develop skills in multi-country collaboration, grant writing and overseeing research projects in LMICs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Roads and neighborhoods with a built environment that support safe and active transportation are a major priority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to 90% of road traffic deaths occurring in these locations, especially to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, yet data on key built environment features at a large scale are not always readily available in these settings. My career goal is to improve population health by examining the effects of the built environment and transportation on health through the adoption and use of methods that can leverage Big Data sources and answer complex, multilevel research questions by overcoming the lack of built environment data in LMICs. The proposed research uses deep learning and advanced statistical methods to create a citywide dataset of built and social environment features in Bogota, Colombia that will provide crucial data to answer questions of their impact on pedestrian injuries and deaths, as well as assessing the presence of health inequities in their distribution and that will lay the groundwork to expand these efforts to more cities in Latin America and other LMICs.","Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study",10123391,K01TW011782,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Colombia', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Education', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Label', 'Latin America', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Typology', 'Urban Developments', 'Urban Health', 'Vehicle crash', 'Writing', 'automated image analysis', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data infrastructure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'neighborhood association', 'neural network', 'pedestrian injury', 'population health', 'skills', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'virtual']",FIC,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,138024,-0.019014859959079134

"Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Abstract The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research and for the understanding of biological processes of disease which leads to improved diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction. Ranging from cancer diagnosis to heart rejection and forensics the subjective interpretation of histopathology sections forms the basis of clinical decision making and research outcomes. However, it has been shown that such subjective interpretation of pathology slides suffers from large interobserver and intraobserver variability. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning has enabled the objective and automated analysis of images. These methods have been applied with success to histology images which have demonstrated potential for development of objective image interpretation paradigms. However, significant algorithmic challenges remain to be addressed before such objective analysis of histology images can be used by clinicians and researchers. Leveraging extensive experience in developing and decimating research software based on deep learning the PI will pioneer novel algorithmic approaches to address these challenges including but not limited to: (1) training data-efficient and interpretable deep learning models with gigapixel size microscopy images for classification and segmentation using weakly supervised labels (2) fundamental redesign of data fusion paradigms for integrating information from microscopy images and molecular profiles (from multi-omics data) for improved diagnostic and prognostic determinations (3) developing visualization and interpretation software for researchers and clinical workflows to improve clinical and research validation and reproducability. The system will be designed in a modular, user-friendly manner and will be open-source, available through GitHub as universal plug-and-play modules ready to be adapted to various clinical and research applications. We will also develop a web resource with pretrained models for various organs, disease states and subtypes these will be accompanied with detailed manuals so researchers can apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Overall, the laboratory’s research will yield high impact discoveries from pathology image analysis, and its software will enable many other NIH funded laboratories to do the same, across various biomedical disciplines.

"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

"Deep learning to quantify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs for teleophthalmology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Atalie Carina Thompson, MD, MPH is a current glaucoma fellow and Heed fellow with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist and leader in the field of glaucoma and public health. She has a long-standing interest in addressing healthcare disparities in medicine, and in improving the diagnosis of glaucoma and other ophthalmic diseases through imaging technology. While obtaining a medical degree at Stanford, she received a fellowship to complete a master’s degree in public health with additional higher-level coursework in biostatistics and epidemiology. Her immediate goal in this proposal is to refine and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm capable of quantifying neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs and then to apply it in a pilot teleophthalmology program. With a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award, she will acquire additional didactic training and mentored research experience in glaucoma imaging, machine learning, biostatistics, clinical research, and the responsible conduct of research. Environment: The mentorship and expertise of the advisory committee, the extensive resources at the Duke Eye Center and Departments of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering, and the significant institutional commitment will provide her with the support needed to transition successfully into an independent clinician-scientist. Research: This proposal will test the hypothesis that a DL algorithm trained with SDOCT detects glaucoma on optic disc photographs with greater accuracy than human graders. In Specific Aim 1, a DL algorithm that quantifies neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs will be refined. The main hypothesis is that the quantitative output provided by the DL algorithm will allow accurate discrimination of eyes at different stages of the disease according to standard automated perimetry, and will generate cut-offs suitable for use in a screening setting. In Specific Aim 2, the short-term repeatability and reproducibility of the DL algorithm in optic disc photographs acquired over a time period of several weeks will be determined. The hypothesis is that the test-retest variability of the predictions from the DL algorithm will be similar to the original measurements acquired by SDOCT. In Specific Aim 3, the DL algorithm will be applied to optic disc photographs obtained during a pilot screening teleophthalmology program in primary care clinics and assisted living facilities. The hypothesis is that the DL algorithm will be more accurate than human graders when a full ophthalmic examination is used as the gold standard. This work will constitute the basis of an R01 grant and will advance our understanding of the application of deep learning algorithms in glaucoma and teleophthalmology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. However, since the disease can be asymptomatic until later stages, many patients with glaucoma will not know they have glaucoma until they suffer substantial and irreversible visual field loss.

"Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation Summary/Abstract Alignment of biological sequences is a key step in understanding their evolution, function, and patterns of activity. Here, we describe Machine Learning approaches to improve both accuracy and speed of highly- sensitive sequence alignment. To improve accuracy, we develop methods to reduce erroneous annotation caused by (1) the existence of low complexity and repetitive sequence and (2) the overextension of alignments of true homologs into unrelated sequence. We describe approaches based on both hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks to dramatically reduce these sorts of sequence annotation error. We also address the issue of annotation speed, with development of a custom Deep Learning architecture designed to very quickly filter away large portions of candidate sequence comparisons prior to the relatively-slow sequence-alignment step. The results of these efforts will be incorporated into forks of the open source sequence alignment tools HMMER, MMSeqs, and (where appropriate) BLAST; we will also work with community developers of annotation pipelines, such as RepeatMasker and IMG/M, to incorporate these approaches. The development and incorporation into these widely used bioinformatics tools will lead to widespread impact on sequence annotation efforts. Narrative Modern molecular biology depends on effective methods for creating sequence alignments quickly and accurately. This proposal describes a plan to develop novel Machine Learning approaches that will dramatically increase the speed of highly-sensitive sequence alignment, and will also address two significant sources of erroneous sequence annotation, (i) the presence of repetitive sequence in biological sequences, and (ii) the tendency for sequence alignment algorithms to extend alignments beyond the boundaries of true homology. The proposed methods represent a mix of applications of hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks, and build on prior success in applying such methods to the problem of sensitive sequence annotation.",Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation,10020995,R01GM132600,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Error Sources', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Industry Standard', 'Insertion Mutation', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Biology', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proteins', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Takifugu', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'computing resources', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'markov model', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA,R01,2020,287504,-0.03410429404933184
"Center for Machine Learning in Urology PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to establish an Exploratory Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Benign Urology at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), the central mission of which is to apply machine learning to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of treatment responses of benign urological disease among children and adults. The proposed CHOP/Penn Center for Machine Learning in Urology (CMLU) addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede the development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. Structurally, urologic research occurs in silos, with little interaction among investigators that study different diseases or different populations (e.g. pediatric and adult). Scientifically, analysis of imaging and other types complex data is limited by inter-observer variability, and incomplete utilization of available information. This proposal overcomes these barriers by applying cutting-edge approaches in machine learning to analyze CT images that are routinely obtained for evaluation of individuals with kidney stone disease. Central to the CHOP/Penn CMLU is the partnership of urologists and experts in machine learning, which will bring a new approach to generating knowledge that advances research and clinical care. In addition, the CMLU will expand the urologic research community by providing a research platform and standalone machine learning executables that could be applied to other datasets. The Center’s mission will be achieved through the following Aims, with progress assessed through systematic evaluation: Aim 1. To expand the research base investigating benign urological disease. We will establish a community with the research base, particularly with the KURe, UroEpi programs, other P20 Centers, and O’Brien Centers. We will build this community by providing mini-coaching clinics to facilitate application of machine learning to individual projects, developing an educational hub for synchronous and asynchronous engagement with the research base, and making freely available all source codes and standalone executables for all machine learning tools. Aim 2. To improve prediction of ureteral stone passage using machine learning of CT images. The CMLU has developed deep learning methods that segment and automate measurement of urinary stones and adjacent renal anatomy. In the Research Project, we will compare these methods to existing segmentation methods and the current gold standard of manual measurement. We will then extract informative features from thousands of CT scans to predict the probability of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones for children and adults evaluated in the CHOP and Penn healthcare systems. Aim 3. To foster collaboration in benign urological disease research across levels of training and centers through an Educational Enrichment Program. We will amplify interactions across institutions and engage investigators locally and nationally by providing summer research internships, and interinstitutional exchange program, and an annual research symposium. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed CHOP/Penn O’Brien Center for Machine Learning in Urology addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. This application overcomes these barriers by applying cutting- edge approaches in machine learning to analyze complex imaging data for individuals with kidney stone disease.The Center’s strategic vision of using machine learning to generate knowledge that improves diagnosis, risk stratification strategies, and prediction of outcomes among children and adults will be achieved through the implementation of a Educational Enrichment Program and a Research Project.",Center for Machine Learning in Urology,10133362,P20DK127488,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internships', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk stratification', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologist', 'Urology', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'complex data ', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'human error', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'programs', 'routine imaging', 'senior faculty', 'skills', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'tool', 'urologic', 'web page']",NIDDK,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,P20,2020,358890,-0.04303731875182827
"Development of a joint machine learning/de novo assembly system for resolving viral quasispecies PROJECT SUMMARY Viral hepatitis from hepatitis B (HBV) establishes chronic infections in >250M people worldwide; chronicity is on the rise, and approximately one-third of the world’s population (2 billion) has serologic evidence of exposure. HBV coinfection with HCV and HIV is a hidden consequence of the substance use disorder epidemic. Viral populations have extremely high sequence diversity and rapidly evolve, which explains the vaccine failure rates and viral resistance to existing therapies and makes discovering lasting therapies extremely challenging. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is the method of choice to assess the intra-host virus population, termed a “quasispecies”. While a large set of short DNA sequencing reads are acquired that represent the virions in the quasispecies, computational technologies are limited in their analysis capabilities, resulting in particularly low resolution of complex HBV genomic structures. Another challenge is assembling NGS reads representing short fragment of the host genome into full strains (haplotypes) without knowledge of their true occurrence in the samples. To meet these challenges, GATACA is developing pathogen-specific bioinformatics software, GAT-ML (GATACA Assembly Tool – machine learning [ML]) to support treatment discovery and improve infection control. Its specifically designed algorithm utilizes novel ML methodologies adapted and modified for assisting genome assembly that will allow GAT-ML to reconstruct complete viral haplotypes and populations by learning the ‘language’ of the sequences. Tailored initially for HBV samples, GAT and its new ML system will be integrated for feasibility testing in this Phase I with the following Specific Aims: 1. Specific Aim 1. Build a joint learning system. Train and test natural language processing (NLP) methods on HBV genetic variation. 2. Specific Aim 2. Implement and test the machine learning methods in GAT (GAT-ML). We anticipate a working tool for characterizing HBV haplotypes, validated with multi-sourced datasets, and extensive testing and benchmarking of offline and integrated methods. The proposed project will develop and increase the capabilities of our novel computational tool, GAT, to help researchers identify the full spectrum of genetic features of a viral population—such as emergence and persistence of resistance or baseline polymorphisms regardless of their frequencies—and translate these findings to the development of new or improved antiviral drugs and other applications requiring high analytic sensitivity. GAT will particularly benefit researchers working in preclinical stages of drug development who require rapid, sensitive, and reliable results to inform decisions about which targets to advance to clinical trial testing.",Development of a joint machine learning/de novo assembly system for resolving viral quasispecies,10011686,R43AI152894,"['Adoption', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HIV', 'HIV/HCV', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Infection Control', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Serological', 'Serotyping', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Virion', 'Virus', 'base', 'chronic infection', 'co-infection', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'design', 'drug development', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'neural network', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pre-clinical', 'structural genomics', 'syntax', 'tool', 'viral resistance']",NIAID,"GATACA, LLC",R43,2020,267225,-0.01978012150318225
"Development of Accurate and Interpretable Machine Learning Algorithms for their application in Medicine Project Summary  The objective of this proposal is to provide a robust course of training for Gilmer Valdes, PhD, DABR, a candidate with an excellent foundation in clinical and machine learning research, to enable him to become an independent investigator. The proposed research aims to address a tradeoff between interpretability and accuracy of modern machine learning algorithms which limits their use in clinical practice. The candidate’s central hypothesis is that the current tradeoff is not a law of nature but rather a limitation of current interpretable machine learning algorithms. Towards proving this hypothesis, the candidate, leading a multidisciplinary team, have developed unique mathematical frameworks (MediBoost and the Conditional Interpretable Super Learner) to build interpretable and accurate models. The proposed research will I) implement and extensively benchmark these frameworks and II) use the algorithms develop to solve three clinical problems where potentially suboptimal models are currently used to make clinical decisions: 1) predicting mortality in the Intensive Care Unit, 2) predicting risk of Hospital Acquired Venous Thromboembolism, 3) predicting which prostate cancer patients benefit the most from adjuvant radiotherapy. The candidate’s training and research plan, multidisciplinary by nature, takes advantage of the proximity of UC San Francisco, Stanford and UC Berkeley and proposes a training plan that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere. Recognizing the multidisciplinary nature of the work proposed, the author will be mentored and work closely with a stellar committee from three institutions and different scientific areas (Machine Learning, Biostatistics, Statistics, Hospital Medicine, Cancer Research and Quality Assurance in Medicine): Jerome H. Friedman PhD (Stanford Statistics Department), Mark Van der Laan PhD (Berkeley Biostatistics and Statistics Department), Mark Segal (UCSF Epidimiology and Biostatistics Deparments), Andrew Auerbach MD (UCSF Medicine Department), Felix Y. Feng MD (UCSF Radiation Oncology),and Timothy D. Solberg PhD (UCSF Radiation Oncology). This committee will be coordinated by Dr Solberg. The candidate also counts with a strong a multidisciplinary team of collaborators. Successful completion of the proposed research will develop the next generation of accurate and interpretable Machine Learning algorithms and solve three important clinical problems where linear models are currently used in clinical settings. This proposal has wide-ranging implications across the healthcare spectrum. The intermediate-term goal is for the candidate to acquire the knowledge, technical skills and expertise necessary to submit a successful R01 proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current state of the art machine learning algorithms have a marked tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. In medicine, where errors can have a dire consequence and knowledge representation and validation is as relevant as accuracy, the development of accurate and interpretable algorithms is of paramount importance.

"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Successful completion of this project will result in novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, predictive models for patient outcomes, and powerful computational frameworks generalizable to critical problems in various diseases.",Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models,10020414,R35GM128638,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2020,388750,-0.02690084959175234
"A Machine Learning-Based Mobile Application and Cloud Platform to Enable Accurate and Streamlined Surveillance of Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infection and Schistosomiasis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections and schistosomiasis affect 2 billion people and have significant detrimental effects on health. Strategies to implement STH and schistosomiasis interventions currently rely on testing for these parasites by microscopic analysis of stool samples to detect parasite eggs and identify egg species. Accurate surveillance testing and timely and accurate reporting of results are required for effective decision-making at the programmatic level to implement infection control strategies. Approaches that increase the speed and standardize the accuracy of microscopy-based testing and streamline reporting could help eliminate STH infections and schistosomiasis. We propose to develop a mobile phone-based STH-schistosome egg identification and counting tool that employs machine learning (deep learning) and works in the absence of an internet connection. With this app, users will collect surveillance data for integration into a cloud platform. Surveillance data can then be visualized in dashboards to inform interventions to control disease. Our approach is fundamentally different from other published work that develop machine learning algorithms for STH and schistosomiasis because it will very accurately identify egg types during surveillance activities, and it will be available to users in an app and integrate with cloud storage and reporting. Our interdisciplinary team combines the expertise of global health researchers, product usability testing experts, microscopists, and data scientists. In the R21 phase, we will collect the largest ever microscopy image set of STH and schistosome eggs (> 15 000). We will train an algorithm based on convolutional neural networks that make highly accurate parasite egg classification (species identification) and embed this algorithm into a mobile app that works without internet connectivity. To promote app utility, we will evaluate its accuracy and usability in a surveillance setting. We established the feasibility of our approach in preliminary data by building a web app that serves the results of a deep learning model that identifies STH and schistosome eggs with > 98% accuracy. The R33 phase will be only undertaken if well-defined milestones are achieved. We will further develop the mobile app as a data capture system that will integrate with cloud storage and a dynamic data visualization system to enable increased accuracy in STH and schistosomiasis surveillance over time and across geographic location. ​Validation studies will assess the​ benefits of the system to time and cost savings and quality of data collected during surveillance activities. The overall goal of this work is to increase the accuracy and streamline STH and schistosomiasis surveillance to enable effective decision-making in disease control. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate surveillance testing in the field and timely and accurate reporting of results are required for effective decision-making by soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection and schistosomiasis control and prevention programs. This project will develop and test a mobile phone-based STH-schistosomiasis diagnostic system that employs machine learning to very accurately identify and count parasite eggs from microscopy images of stool samples.

"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy Project Summary/Abstract Artificial intelligence on genomic/healthcare data that is performed jointly between multiple collaborating institutions relies on a trust model but can accelerate genomic medicine research and facilitate quality improvement. To conduct such machine learning while protecting patient privacy and reducing security risks, we are developing blockchain-based privacy-preserving learning methods in a K99/R00 study supported by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). However, our previous design of privacy-preserving learning on private blockchain assumed “semi-honesty” as the underlying adversary assumption. That is, we assume that each participating site is curious yet very careful and honest, such that it would only submit correct predictive models. Nevertheless, in real world this assumption may be too optimistic; the models submitted could be an old one due to network latency or malicious users may try to create fake models, which can in turn lead to bioethical concerns and reduce the incentives for genomic/clinical institutions to participate in the collaborative predictive modeling. Therefore, the capability to detect, assess and prevent “model misconducts” is critical to increase the integrity/reliability of machine learning. To address this issue, we consider the following 3 types of model misconducts: (1) model plagiarism, of which a site becomes a free-rider and just submits a copy of a model from the other sites, trying to hide their own information and inspect models from other sites; (2) model fabrication, of which a site mocks up a model, trying to hide information and disturb the machine learning process; and (3) model falsification, of which a site tweaks its model a bit, trying to just disturb the learning process. For each type of the model misconducts, we are interest in how to detect these misconducts of another site, how to assess the losses of machine learning results due to misconducts, and how to prevent these model misconducts. Our aims include (a) detecting model misconducts using model properties, (b) assessing model misconducts losses via model simulation, and (c) preventing model misconducts based on whole model history. The innovative components to our proposed project include (i) summarizing various types of model misconduct, (ii) developing a complete strategy to handle the model misconduct, and (iii) providing a generalizable approach to mitigate bioethical concerns for collaborative machine learning. Project Narrative Artificial intelligence performed jointly between multiple collaborating institutions can accelerate genomic medicine research and facilitate quality improvement, but relies on a trust model which may be too optimistic in real-world setting. In this project, we plan to develop a comprehensive detection, assessment and prevention mechanism to address the potential bioethical risks brought by misconducts of model plagiarism, fabrication, and falsification. The proposed study can supplement the considerations of model misconducts for our original project of privacy-preserving learning on blockchain.",BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy,10130868,R00HG009680,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioethics', 'Budgets', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Digit structure', 'Discrimination', 'Event', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Incentives', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Pattern', 'Plagiarism', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Security', 'Site', 'Sum', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'base', 'blockchain', 'design', 'distributed ledger', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'models and simulation', 'patient privacy', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'privacy preservation', 'statistics']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R00,2020,102049,-0.005005690463622851

ALS is a disease of motor neurons that that is almost uniformly lethal within only 3-5 years of diagnosis. FTD is a heterogeneous, rapidly progressing syndrome that is among the top three causes of presenile dementia. About 10% of ALS cases are caused by dominantly transmitted gene defects. SOD1 and FUS mutations cause aggressive motor neuron pathology while TDP43 mutations cause ALS-FTD. Further, wild type FUS and TDP43 are components of abnormal inclusions in many FTD cases, suggesting a mechanistic link between these disorders. Early phenotypes are of particular interest because these could lead to targeted interventions aimed at the root cause of the disorder that could stem the currently inexorable disease progression. Elucidating such early, potentially shared characteristics of these disorders should be greatly aided by: 1) knock-in animal models expressing familial ALS-FTD genes; 2) sensitive, rigorous and objective behavioral phenotyping methods to analyze and compare models generated in different laboratories. In published work the co-PIs applied their first-generation, machine vision-based automated phenotyping method, ACBM ‘1.0’ (automated continuous behavioral monitoring) to detect and quantify the earliest-observed phenotypes in Tdp43Q331K knock-in mice. This method entails continuous video recording for 5 days to generate >14 million frames/mouse. These videos are then scored by a trained computer vision system. In addition to its sensitivity, objectivity and reproducibility, a major advantage of this method is the ability to acquire and archive video recordings and to analyze the data at sites, including the Cloud, remote from those of acquisition. We will use Google Cloud TPUs supercomputers that have been designed from the ground up to accelerate cutting-edge machine learning workloads, with a special focus on deep learning. We will analyze this data using Bayesian hierarchical spline models that describe the different mouse behaviors along the circadian rhythm. The current proposal has two main goals: 1) Use deep learning to refine and apply a Next Generation ACBM - ‘2.0’ - that will allow for more sensitive, expansive and robust automated behavioral phenotyping of four novel knock-in models along with the well characterized SOD1G93A transgenic mouse. 2) To establish and validate procedures to enable remote acquisition of video recording data with cloud-based analysis. Our vision is to establish sensitive, robust, objective, and open-source machine vision-based behavioral analysis tools that will be widely available to researchers in the field. Since all the computer-annotated video data is standardized in ACBM 2.0 and will be archived, we envision a searchable ‘behavioral database’, that can be freely mined and analyzed. Such tools are critical to accelerate the development of novel and effective therapeutics for ALS-FTD. Narrative ALS and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are devastating, rapidly progressing diseases and current treatments are of limited value. In this proposal a neuroscientist and a computer scientist have teamed up to develop a new machine vision-based method for behavioral analysis novel mouse models of ALS-FTD. The ultimate goal is to reveal early phenotypes in ALS-FTD models that can be used in understanding disease pathology and in the development of new therapeutic targets.",Next generation machine vision for automated behavioral phenotyping of knock-in ALS-FTD mouse models,9979408,R21NS112743,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Expression Profiling', 'Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Paralysed', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Presenile Dementia', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Paralysis', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'TensorFlow', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cloud based', 'data archive', 'deep learning', 'design', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'interest', 'knockin animal', 'machine vision', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'protein TDP-43', 'stem', 'supercomputer', 'superoxide dismutase 1', 'tool']",NINDS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,446875,-0.020414388969834885
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy,9921505,R01NS111744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Limbic System', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Rattus', 'Records', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Voting', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'animal data', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'data acquisition', 'data fusion', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'human data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'post-trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'support vector machine', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,245552,-0.009422728479277947
"POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION Project Summary Malaria that results from Plasmodium falciparum is among the most globally devastating human diseases. The principle vector of malaria, mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex, are thus central targets for controlling the human health burden of Plasmodium. For nearly two decades, there have been large-scale, coordinated efforts to diminish mosquito populations, generally through spraying and insecticide treated bed nets. Indeed such control efforts have now led to a nearly 50% decrease in the rates of malaria infection in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. At present, however, control efforts of A. gambiae are being threatened by evolutionary responses within mosquitos: A. gambiae populations have shown increases in insecticide resistance as well as behavioral adaptations that allow mosquitos to avoid spraying all together. Thus adaptation of mosquitos to the control efforts themselves is currently a risk to maintain the gains made in the fight against malaria. In this proposal we lay out an integrated population genomic approach for systematically identifying regions of the A. gambiae genome that are evolving adaptively in response to ongoing control efforts. Our approach centers upon state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques that we have recently introduced for finding the signatures of selective sweeps in genomes (Schrider and Kern, 2016), coupled with the large-scale population genomic datasets currently in production by the Ag1000G consortium. Project Narrative Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has enormous impacts on human health globally. For the past 16 years, large gains have been made in decreasing the rate of malaria transmission through control of its mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae; unfortunately at present these control efforts are in danger of collapse due to the evolution of insecticide resistance in the mosquitos. We aim to discover the genomic targets of such resistance through the development of sophisticated population genomic approaches and their application to state-of- the-art genome sequence datasets from Anopheles gambiae.",POPULATION GENOMICS OF ADAPTATION,9957109,R01GM117241,"['Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anopheles Genus', 'Anopheles gambiae', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Catalogs', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'Insecticides', 'Link', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mosquito-borne infectious disease', 'Mutation', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'deep neural network', 'fight against', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'human disease', 'machine learning method', 'malaria infection', 'malaria mosquito', 'malaria transmission', 'markov model', 'novel', 'recurrent neural network', 'resistance allele', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'vector', 'vector control', 'vector mosquito']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2020,295000,-0.023294462967837076
"Robust AI to develop risk models in retinopathy of prematurity using deep learning ROP is a retinal neovascular disease affecting preterm infants, and is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. Known clinical risk factors include preterm birth, low birthweight and use of supplemental oxygen but improved risk models are needed to identify infants that progress to treatment requiring disease and blindness. Deep learning techniques have been used to successfully identify “plus” disease in multi- institutional cohorts and to provide a continuous measure of disease severity. A major limitation of deep learning, however, is the need for large amounts of well curated datasets. Other limitations include overfitting and “brittleness” that can cause model performance to drop on external data. There are, however, numerous barriers to building and hosting these large central repositories with multi-institutional data required for robust deep learning including concerns about data sharing, regulations costs, patient privacy and intellectual property. In this project, we aim to demonstrate the utility of distributed/federated deep learning approaches where the data are located within institutions, but model parameters are shared with a central server. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Specifically, we seek to build robust risk models for predicting treatment requiring disease. Two large cohorts will be used to validate the hypothesis that the performance of the risk models using distributed learning approaches that of centrally hosted and is more robust than models built on single institutional datasets.

"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection.

"A New Paradigm for Systems Physiology Modeling: Biomechanistic Learning Augmentation with Deep Differential Equation Representations (BLADDER) Many promising peripheral neuromodulation techniques have been proposed to treat lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction, but our lack of predictive models has forced the community (including the PI’s lab) to explore the vast parameter space of nerve targets, stimulation parameterizations, and electrode designs empirically in animal experiments by trial and error. This type of exploratory experimentation is the only current method of optimizing, personalizing, or discovering novel LUT neuromodulation techniques. Motivated by this clinical need, our long-term goal for this work is to predict the effects of neuromodulation on the LUT. To move toward this goal, we propose to develop a new modeling framework that integrates disparate biophysics models through machine learning, thereby emulating an entire organ system through a process we call Biomechanistic Learning Augmentation of Deep Differential Equation Representations (BLADDER). We will develop and use the general BLADDER framework to create an organ-level model of the normal healthy LUT throughout its filling and voiding cycles, including non-volitional neural reflex control over the bladder and urethra. Our focus on neural reflex control and organ-level scales ensures that, if successful, the BLADDER LUT model will be poised to predict effects of neuromodulation using computational studies, which so far has been impossible due to the complexity of the LUT. The BLADDER framework unites multiple individual mechanistic models (each accounting for a component function of an organ system) by using deep recurrent neural networks (RNN) to learn the appropriate coupling dynamics linking each component model. The combination of mechanistic and machine learning models under a single framework allows us to harness the advantages of both: mechanistic models excel at interpretability but suffer from a lack of scalability (becoming intractable at the level of organ systems), while machine learning models are excellent at scale but lack generalizability and insights for hypothesis generation. The BLADDER framework will scale up mechanistic models to the level of systems physiology by linking tractable model components together using a supervisory RNN, allowing the BLADDER framework to deliver both interpretability and scale. We will draw on existing SPARC datasets in the cat (e.g., Bruns and Gaunt), existing publicly available data in rat, and generate new data in the rat to construct a training dataset for the supervisory RNN. We will further draw from already published small-scale mechanistic models, validated on human and animal data, for the mechanistic components of the BLADDER LUT model. The formal process of identifying these models and datasets, and checking their validity and robustness, will clearly reveal the deficits and strengths in our theoretical and experimental understanding of the LUT in a straightforward and rational way. We will use the 10 Simple Rules to vet mechanistic models for inclusion in the BLADDER LUT model and compile a public inventory for the neurourology community. Major task 1 (Q1-2): Identify available datasets and candidate mechanistic models from published literature. Major deliverables are a public database and a whitepaper detailing the state of the field and prospects for modeling and experimental work. Major Task 2 (Q1-3): Demonstrate proof of concept of BLADDER framework. Major deliverables are a publicly available code linking two LUT component models via supervisory RNN and a report on suitable RNN architectures based on fully described dynamical systems. Major Task 3 (Q3-6): Create a multi-component BLADDER model. Major deliverables are code used to link separate mechanistic LUT models via the supervisory RNN, and an in vivo rat dataset to fill in critical measurables for the machine learning training set.

"Developing a virtual placenta biobank Project Summary / Abstract The placenta is the first organ to develop and functions as the fetal lung, kidney, gut, skin, immune and endocrine systems. It is the cause of, and reflects changes from, most diseases in pregnancy, yet remains understudied. This career development proposal will train me in the tools and practice of digital pathology, while I apply them to the placenta with the hypothesis that there are reproducible, quantitative changes in the placenta that can be modeled and used to identify abnormalities via artificial intelligence (AI). I will create a publicly available atlas of microscopically normal placentas from throughout the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Whole slide imaging will be performed on microscopic slides of placentas from the beginning of the 2nd trimester (13 weeks) through post-term (42 weeks). I will lead a team to annotate tissue type, structures, and cells. Algorithms will be trained to replicate the manual annotations. To study the changes in the placenta over time, automated measurements will be performed to identify changes in shape, size, and cellularity of placental structures that correlate with gestational age. This research can be used to develop a model of placental development and study prematurity. I will demonstrate detection of diseases of pregnancy, using preeclampsia (PreE) as an example. Placentas with microscopic changes classically seen in PreE will be scanned and annotated and algorithms trained and tested to identify them. Like many diseases of pregnancy, placental changes in PreE are variable and sometimes absent. Slides from PreE cases with no microscopic abnormalities will be scanned and examined using the quantitative parameters developed for normal placentas, testing the hypothesis that one or more of them will significantly differ between PreE cases and gestational age- matched controls. I am an Assistant Professor of Pathology at Northwestern University with an emerging focus in informatics and machine learning for diseases of pregnancy. The mentor for this project is Lee D.A. Cooper, PhD, an expert in digital pathology and machine learning. The co-mentor is David M. Aronoff, MD, an expert in maternal-child health. Mentor and co-mentor both have a history of NIH funding and graduating mentees to independence. The advisory committee consists of a digital pathology expert (Gutman), a pediatrician (Mestan) and a pathologist physician scientist (Yang). They have proposed an aggressive schedule of one-on-one meetings, coursework, seminars, and scientific meetings to supplement learning by doing the science. Completion of these studies will build my expertise in the application of machine learning to placental pathology while creating a new, publicly- accessible tool for the rapid assessment and understanding of organ structure and function with great potential to improve maternal-child health. Project Narrative The placenta grows over the course of gestation from a single layer of cells to a complex organ that acts as the fetal skin, lung, gut, kidney, immune system, and endocrine system. This project will develop an online repository of placenta microscopic images over the course of gestation from normal placentas and one disease of pregnancy, preeclampsia.

"Novel machine learning approaches for improving structural discrimination in cryo-electron tomography Project Summary Cellular cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) has made possible the observation of cellular organelles and macromolecular complexes at nanometer resolution with native conformations. The rapid increasing amount of Cryo-ET data available however brings along some major challenges for analysis which we will timely ad- dress in this proposal. We will design novel data-driven machine learning algorithms for improving structural discrimination and resolution. In particular, we have the following speciﬁc aims: (1) We will develop a novel Autoencoder and Iterative region Matching (AIM) algorithm for marker-free alignment of image tilt-series to re- construct tomograms with improved resolution; (2) We will develop a saliency-based auto-picking algorithm for better detecting macromolecular complexes, and combine it with an innovative 2D-to-3D framework to further improve structure detection accuracy; (3) We will design an end-to-end convolutional model for pose-invariant clustering of subtomograms. This model will produce an initial clustering which will be reﬁned by a new subto- mogram averaging algorithm that automatically down-weights subtomograms of noise and little contribution; (4) We will perform experimental evaluations by using previously reported bacterial secretion systems and mito- chondrial ultrastructures datasets to improve the ﬁnal resolution. Implementing algorithms in Aims 1-3, we will develop a user-friendly open-source graphical user interface -tom to directly beneﬁt the scientiﬁc community.  -tom will be systematically compared with existing software including IMOD, EMAN2, and Relion on simulated and benchmark datasets. To facilitate distribution, -tom will be integrated into existing software platforms Sci- pion and TomoMiner. Our data-driven algorithms and software not only will facilitate and accelerate the future use of Cryo-ET, but also can be readily used on analyzing the existing large amounts of Cryo-ET data to im- prove our understanding of the structure, function, and spatial organization of macromolecular complexes in situ.

"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current clinical image modalities can be utilized to develop patient-specific computational models to pre-operatively plan transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. However, the computational modeling and simulation processes are time-consuming, which limits clinical translatability. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop algorithms using machine learning techniques to rapidly process and predict TAVR computational simulation outcomes directly from clinical image data.",A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes,9973167,R01HL142036,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Extravasation', 'Feedback', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Valves', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Postoperative Period', 'Problem Sets', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Response Elements', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stents', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm training', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'calcification', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'population based', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'speech recognition', 'time resolved data', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual clinical trial']",NHLBI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,383601,-0.018023678130655058
"Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer Abstract FreeSurfer is a tool for the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that has proven to be a flexible and powerful technology for quantifying the effects of many conditions, including numerous neurological disorders, on human brain anatomy, connectivity, vasculature, chemical composition, physiology and function. In the past 20 years, these open source tools have been developed to accurately and automatically segment an array of brain structures and have become the core analysis infrastructure for the Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative (ADNI). In this project, we seek the resources to radically increase the speed, accuracy and flexibility of these tools, taking advantage of exciting new results in Deep Learning. This will enable us to more accurately quantify neuroanatomical changes that are critical to diagnosing, staging and assessing the efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions in diseases such as Alzheimer’s. This includes the generation of documentation, tutorials, unit tests, regression tests and system tests to harden the tools and make them usable by clinicians and neuroscientists, and finally the distribution and support of the data, manual labelings and tools to the more than 40,000 researchers that use FreeSurfer through our existing open source mechanism. In addition, we will analyze the entire Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative dataset and return it for public release, including a set of manually labeled data that can be used to optimize Deep Learning tools for Alzheimer’s Disease over the next decade. Relevance Successful completion of the proposed project will increase the usability and accuracy of our publicly available segmentation tools, and open up new possibilities, such as integrating them into the MRI scanner and rapidly detecting Alzheimer’s-related changes. These new capabilities well enable other studies to significantly increase their ability to detect AD and other disease effects in research settings as well as phase II and phase III clinical trials due to the radical increase in speed of the new tools, enabling them to be applied to a diverse set of MRI contrasts and much larger datasets, rapidly and accurately. Further, they will allow rapid application of cutting-edge analyses to the ongoing Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative dataset, improving the ability to extract early biomarkers of this devastating disease.",Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer,9970009,R01AG064027,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Licensing', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'early detection biomarkers', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'skills', 'spatial relationship', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability', 'web site', 'wiki']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,649026,-0.08227736207889534
"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia",9963080,R01AG053949,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Bayesian learning', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Harvest', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevention approach', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Saliva', 'Scanning', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'aging brain', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'case control', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'genetic testing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk minimization', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'software development', 'sound', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIA,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,410000,-0.081890678665325

"Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches Project Summary The form (or shape) and function relationship of anatomical structures is a central theme in biology where abnor- mal shape changes are closely tied to pathological functions. Morphometrics has been an indispensable quan- titative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms for more than 100 years. Recently, the increased availability of high-resolution in-vivo images of anatomy has led to the development of a new generation of morphometric approaches, called statistical shape modeling (SSM), that take advantage of modern computa- tional techniques to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail. SSM stands to revolutionize morphometric analysis, but its widespread adoption is hindered by a number of sig- niﬁcant challenges, including the complexity of the approaches and their increased computational requirements, relative to traditional morphometrics. Arguably, however, the most important roadblock to more widespread adop- tion is the lack of user-friendly and scalable software tools for a variety of anatomical surfaces that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research labs. The goal of this proposal is thus to address these challenges in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM), which automat- ically constructs optimal statistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes without relying on any speciﬁc surface parameterization. The proposed research will provide an automated, general- purpose, and scalable computational solution for constructing shape models of general anatomy. In Aim 1, we will build computational and machine learning algorithms to model anatomies with complex surface topologies (e.g., surface openings and shared boundaries) and highly variable anatomical populations. In Aim 2, we will introduce an end-to-end machine learning approach to extract statistical shape representation directly from im- ages, requiring no parameter tuning, image pre-processing, or user assistance. In Aim 3, we will provide intuitive graphical user interfaces and visualization tools to incorporate user-deﬁned modeling preferences and promote the visual interpretation of shape models. We will also make use of recent advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large cohorts to build and execute custom SSM work- ﬂows using remote scalable computational resources. Algorithmic developments will be thoroughly evaluated and validated using existing, fully funded, large-scale, and constantly growing databases of CT and MRI images lo- cated on-site. Furthermore, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc use cases for complex anatomies to promote reproducibility. Efforts to develop the proposed technology are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), and its third strategic goal: to bridge biology and quantitative science for better global health through supporting the development of and access to computational research tools for biomedical research. Our long-term goal is to increase the clinical utility and widespread adoption of SSM, and the proposed research will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative This project will develop general-purpose, scalable, and open-source statistical shape modeling (SSM) tools, which will present unique capabilities for automated anatomy modeling with less user input. The proposed tech- nology will introduce a number of signiﬁcant improvements to current SSM approaches and tools, including the support for challenging modeling problems, inferring shapes directly from images (and hence bypassing the seg- mentation step), parallel optimizations for speed, and new user interfaces that will be much easier and scalable than the current tools. The proposed technology will constitute an indispensable resource for the biomedical and clinical communities that will enable new avenues for biomedical research and clinical investigations, provide new ways to answer biologically related questions, allow new types of questions to be asked, and open the door for the integration of SSM with clinical care.","Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches",9969467,R01AR076120,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomic Surface', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Bypass', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Felis catus', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Ice', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematical Computing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Morphogenesis', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Orthopedics', 'Pathologic', 'Population', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'graphical user interface', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'multidisciplinary', 'open source', 'particle', 'preference', 'software development', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,614363,0.008686287178360655
"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,9974350,R01NS112497,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Meningoencephalitis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neocortex', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'computational intelligence', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2020,459252,-0.020669059160438687
"COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data Project Summary/Abstract  The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway. However, there is still a major gap in that much data is still not openly shareable, which we propose to address. In addition, current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions) as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. substantial computational re- sources and time is needed to pool data from large studies with local study data). This needs to change, so that the scientific community can create a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see overview on this from our group7). The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while (if required) leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator or the data host; this motivates a dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. During the previous funding period, we developed a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). Our system provides an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data is avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. During this new phase we respond to the need for advanced algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, by proposing to develop decentralized models for these approaches and also implement a fully scalable cloud-based framework with enhanced security features. To achieve this, in Aim 1, we will incorporate the necessary functionality to scale up analyses via the ability to work with either local or commercial private cloud environments, together with advanced visualization, quality control, and privacy and security features. This suite of new functions will open the floodgates for the use of COINSTAC by the larger neuroscience community to enable new discovery and analysis of unprecedented amounts of brain imaging data located throughout the world. We will also improve usability, training materials, engage the community in contributing to the open source code base, and ultimately facilitate the use of COINSTAC's tools for additional science and discovery in a broad range of applications. In Aim 2 we will extend the framework to handle powerful algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, and to perform meta-learning for leveraging and updating fit models. And finally, in Aim 3, we will test this new functionality through a partnership with the worldwide ENIGMA addiction group, which is currently not able to perform advanced machine learning analyses on data that cannot be centrally located. We will evaluate the impact of 6 main classes of substances of abuse (e.g. methamphetamines, cocaine, cannabis, nicotine, opiates, alcohol and their combinations) using the new developed functionality. 3 Project Narrative  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on collecting human neuroimaging data for clinical and re- search studies, many of which do not come with subject consent for sharing or contain sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a viable solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we propose enables us to capture this `missing data' and achieve the same performance as pooling of both open and `closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of advanced and cutting edge algorithms (including linear mixed effects models and deep learning) and incorpo- rating within an easy-to-use and scalable platform which enables distributed computation. 2","COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",10058463,R01DA040487,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cannabis', 'Clinical Data', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methamphetamine', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Security', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Substance of Abuse', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'cloud based', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data harmonization', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'distributed data', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'life-long learning', 'negative affect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open data', 'open source', 'peer', 'privacy preservation', 'repository', 'scale up', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,627034,0.0036378619128384707
"Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research Project Summary Deep learning methods are showing great promise for advancing cancer research and could potentially improve clinical decision making in cancers such as primary brain glioma, where deep learning models have recently shown promising results in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and survival in these patients. A major challenge thwarting this research, however, is the requirement for large quantities of labeled image data to train deep learning models. Efforts to create large public centralized collections of image data are hindered by barriers to data sharing, costs of image de-identification, patient privacy concerns, and control over how data are used. Current deep learning models that are being built using data from one or a few institutions are limited by potential overfitting and poor generalizability. Instead of centralizing or sharing patient images, we aim to distribute the training of deep learning models across institutions with computations performed on their local image data. Although our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, there are three key challenges to translating these methods into research practice: (1) data is heterogeneous among institutions in the amount and quality of data that could impair the distributed computations, (2) there are data security and privacy concerns, and (3) there are no software packages that implement distributed deep learning with medical images. We tackle these challenges by (1) optimizing and expanding our current methods of distributed deep learning to tackle challenges of data variability and data privacy/security, (2) creating a freely available software system for building deep learning models on multi- institutional data using distributed computation, and (3) evaluating our system to tackle deep learning problems in example use cases of classification and clinical prediction in primary brain cancer. Our approach is innovative in developing distributed deep learning methods that will address variations in data among different institutions, that protect patient privacy during distributed computations, and that enable sites to discover pertinent datasets and participate in creating deep learning models. Our work will be significant and impactful by overcoming critical hurdles that researchers face in tapping into multi-institutional patient data to create deep learning models on large collections of image data that are more representative of disease than data acquired from a single institution, while avoiding the hurdles to inter-institutional sharing of patient data. Ultimately, our methods will enable researchers to collaboratively develop more generalizable deep learning applications to advance cancer care by unlocking access to and leveraging huge amounts of multi-institutional image data. Although our clinical use case in developing this technology is primary brain cancer, our methods will generalize to all cancers, as well as to other types of data besides images for use in creating deep learning models, and will ultimately lead to robust deep learning applications that are expected to improve clinical care and outcomes in many types of cancer. Project Narrative We develop technology that will enable researchers to tap into the enormous amount of imaging data in multiple institutions to create deep learning models for cancer applications without requiring sharing of patient data. Our work will thus enable development of more robust deep learning models to improve clinical decision making in cancer than models currently built on data from single institutions. Although our focus is improving decision making in the primary brain cancer, our methods and tools are generalizable and will be broadly applicable to all cancers, with the potential for improvement in clinical care and patient health.",Distributed Learning of Deep Learning Models for Cancer Research,10018827,U01CA242879,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Brain', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Glioma', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Information Networks', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data privacy', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'molecular marker', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient privacy', 'radiologist', 'research to practice', 'software systems', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,394824,-0.04194975499094433
"Improving Population Representativeness of the Inference from Non-Probability Sample Analysis SUMMARY The critical role of population-representativeness for estimating disease incidence and prevalence has been widely accepted in epidemiologic studies. Improving population representativeness of nonprobability samples, such as samples of volunteers in epidemiologic studies or electronic health records, however, has received little attention by biostatisticians or epidemiologists. In this project, we propose two innovative “pseudoweight” construction methods: 1) two-step matching, and 2) calibration, under an adapted exchangeability assumption, for unbiased estimation of disease incidence and prevalence in the target population. The proposed methods, combined with machine learning methods for propensity score estimation, will achieve significant bias reduction, especially when selection into nonprobability samples is driven by complex relationships between the covariates. We will quantify the bias reduced by the proposed “pseudoweights”, numerically and empirically, on the estimation of disease incidence and prevalence in the target population. Monte Carlo simulation studies are designed under varying degrees of departure from the adapted exchangeability assumption to evaluate the bias of the proposed estimates. The robustness of the proposed estimators against varying sample sizes, number of clusters in survey, and complexities of the true propensity score modeling will be investigated in scenarios that differ by levels of non-linearity, non-additivity and correlations between covariates in the true propensity model. Using data from National Institutes of Health and the American Association of Retired Persons (NIH-AARP, a nonprobability cohort sample) data and the US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS, a probability survey sample), the proposed methods will be applied to estimate the prevalence of self-reported diseases and all-cause or all-cancer mortality rates for people aged 50-71 in the US. To test our methods, we will purposely select outcome variables that are available in both the NIH-AARP and the NHIS. Thus, the amount of bias in NIH-AARP estimates corrected by the proposed pseudoweights can be quantified in practice, assuming the weighted NHIS estimate is true. The proposed methods, although motivated by the volunteer-based epidemiological studies, have wide applications outside of epidemiology, such as electronic health records or web surveys. The results from this project can be used by epidemiologists and health policy makers to improve the understanding of the health-related characteristics in the general population. Computer software that implements the proposed methods will be made available for public use.

"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,9847973,R01GM124443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomechanical model', 'community building', 'complex biological systems', 'data access', 'data cleaning', 'data ecosystem', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'member', 'new technology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'role model', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,489919,-0.003932148101707224
"Leveraging Twitter to Monitor Nicotine and Tobacco Cancer Communication Patterns in Twitter data have revolutionized understanding of public health events such as influenza outbreaks. While researchers have begun to examine messaging related to substance use on Twitter, this project will strengthen the use of Twitter as an infoveillance tool to more rigorously examine nicotine, tobacco, and cancer- related communication. Twitter is particularly suited to this work because its users are commonly adolescents, young adults, and racial and ethnic minorities, all of whom are at increased risk for nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) use and related health consequences. Additionally, due to the openness of the platform, searches are replicable and transparent, enabling large-scale systematic research. Therefore, our multidisciplinary team of experts in diverse relevant fields—including public health, behavioral science, computational linguistics, computer science, biomedical informatics, and information privacy and security—will build upon our previous research to develop and validate structured algorithms providing automated surveillance of Twitter’s multifaceted and continuously evolving information related to NTPs. First, we will qualitatively assess a stratified random sample of relevant NTP-related tweets for specific coded variables, such as the message’s primary sentiment and other key information of potential value (e.g., whether a message involves buying/selling, policy/law, and cancer-related communication). Tweets will be obtained directly from Twitter using software we developed that leverages a comprehensive list of Twitter-optimized search strings related to NTPs. Second, we will statistically determine what message characteristics (e.g., the presence of certain words, punctuation, and/or structures) are most strongly associated with each of the coded variables for each search string. Using this information, we will create specialized Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on state-of-the-art methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically assess and categorize future Twitter data. Third, we will use this information to provide automatic assessment of current and future streaming data. Time series analyses using seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) will determine if there are significant changes over time in volume of messaging related to each specific coded variables of interest. Trends will be examined at the daily, weekly, and monthly level, because each of these levels is potentially valuable for intervention. To maximize the translational value of this project, we will partner with public health department stakeholders who are experts in streamlining dissemination of actionable trends data. In summary, this project will substantially advance our understanding of representations of NTPs on social media—as well as our ability to conduct automated surveillance and analysis of this content. This project will result in important and concrete deliverables, including open-source algorithms for future researchers and processes to quickly disseminate actionable data for tailoring community- level interventions. For this project, we gathered a team of public health researchers and computer scientists to leverage the power of Twitter as a novel surveillance tool to better understand communication about nicotine and tobacco products (NTPs) and related messages about cancer and cancer prevention. We will gather a random sample of Twitter messages (“tweets”) related to NTPs and examine them in depth and use this information to create specialized computer algorithms that can automatically categorize future Twitter data. Then, we will examine changes over time related to attitudes towards and interest in NTPs, as well as cancer-related discussion around various NTPs, which will dramatically improve our ability to better understand Twitter as a tool for this type of surveillance.",Leveraging Twitter to Monitor Nicotine and Tobacco Cancer Communication,10111658,R01CA225773,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'County', 'Data', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Food', 'Football game', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Laws', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Opinion', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Twitter', 'Work', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer prevention', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data standards', 'data streams', 'ethnic minority population', 'geographic difference', 'hookah', 'improved', 'influenza outbreak', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'open source', 'phrases', 'prospective', 'racial minority', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'statistics', 'time use', 'tobacco products', 'tool', 'trend', 'vaping', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT FAYETTEVILLE,R01,2020,491992,-0.03620438956178902
"PREMIERE: A PREdictive Model Index and Exchange REpository The confluence of new machine learning (ML) data-driven approaches; increased computational power; and access to the wealth of electronic health records (EHRs) and other emergent types of data (e.g., omics, imaging, mHealth) are accelerating the development of biomedical predictive models. Such models range from traditional statistical approaches (e.g., regression) through to more advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks, CNNs), and span different tasks (e.g., biomarker/pathway discovery, diagnostic, prognostic). Two issues have become evident: 1) as there are no comprehensive standards to support the dissemination of these models, scientific reproducibility is problematic, given challenges in interpretation and implementation; and 2) as new models are put forth, methods to assess differences in performance, as well as insights into external validity (i.e., transportability), are necessary. Tools moving beyond the sharing of data and model “executables” are needed, capturing the (meta)data necessary to fully reproduce a model and its evaluation. The objective of this R01 is the development of an informatics standard supporting the requisite information for scientific reproducibility for statistical and ML-based biomedical predictive models; from this foundation, we then develop new computational approaches to compare models' performance. We begin by extending the current Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard to fully characterize biomedical datasets and harmonize variable definitions; to elucidate the algorithms involved in model creation (e.g., data preprocessing, parameter estimation); and to explain the validation methodology. Importantly, models in this PMML format will become findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (i.e., following FAIR principles). We then propose novel meth- ods to compare and contrast predictive models, assessing transportability across datasets. While metrics exist for comparing models (e.g., c-statistics, calibration), often the required case-level information is not available to calculate these measures. We thus introduce an approach to simulate cases based on a model's reported da- taset statistics, enabling such calculations. Different levels of transportability are then assigned to the metrics, determining the extent to which a selected model is applicable to a given population/cohort (i.e., helping answer the question, can I use this published model with my own data?). We tie these efforts together in our proposed framework, the PREdictive Model Index & Exchange REpository (PREMIERE). We will develop an online portal and repository for model sharing around PREMIERE, and our efforts will include fostering a community of users to guide its development through workshops, model-thons, and other activities. To demonstrate these efforts, we will bootstrap PREMIERE with predictive models from a targeted domain (risk assessment in imaging-based lung cancer screening). Our efforts to evaluate these developments will engage a range of stakeholders (model developers, users) to inform the completeness of our standard; and biostatisticians and clinical experts to guide assessment of model transportability. PROGRAM NARRATIVE With growing access to information contained in the electronic health record and other data sources, the appli- cation of statistical and machine learning methods are generating more biomedical predictive models. However, there are significant challenges to reproducing these models for purposes of comparison and application in new environments/populations.

"Making antibody generation rapid, scalable, and democratic through machine learning and continuous evolution Project Summary/Abstract It is hard to overstate the importance of monoclonal antibodies in the life sciences. Antibodies are critical tools in biomedical research and diagnostics (e.g. western blotting, immunoprecipitation, cytometry, biomarker discovery, and histology), are one of the most rapidly growing class of therapeutics, and are the basis for myriad new strategies in cancer therapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors that are revolutionizing treatment. Unfortunately, current methods for the generation of custom antibodies, including animal immunization and phage display, are slow, costly, inaccessible to most researchers, and often unsuccessful. We propose Autonomously EvolvinG Yeast-displayed antibodieS (AEGYS), a system for the continuous and rapid evolution of high-quality antibodies against custom antigens that requires only the simple culturing of yeast cells. We believe this can be achieved by combining cutting-edge generative machine learning algorithms for antibody library design with a new technology for in vivo continuous evolution and a yeast antigen-presenting cell that we will engineer. If successful, AEGYS should have a transformative impact across the whole of biomedicine by turning monoclonal antibody generation into a rapid, scalable, and accessible process where any lab with standard molecular biology capabilities can generate custom antibodies on demand simply by “immunizing” a test tube of yeast cells with an antigen. We anticipate that this democratization of antibody generation will also result in an explosion of crowdsourced antibody sequence data that will train our machine learning algorithms to design better antibody libraries for AEGYS, starting a virtuous cycle. We ourselves will use AEGYS to generate a panel of subtype- and conformation-specific nanobodies against biogenic amine receptors including those that respond to acetylcholine, adrenaline, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters, so that we can understand their role in neurobiology and addiction.! Project Narrative This proposal will provide a system for the scalable continuous evolution and computational design of antibodies against user-selected antigens. Antibodies are critical tools in medical research and are the basis for numerous therapies, but the generation of custom antibodies against new targets is a difficult and specialized task. The system proposed will turn antibody generation into a routine and widely accessible process for researchers in almost any field.","Making antibody generation rapid, scalable, and democratic through machine learning and continuous evolution",10021311,R01CA260415,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biogenic Amine Receptors', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Cultured Cells', 'Custom', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detergents', 'Diagnostic', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Epinephrine', 'Evolution', 'Explosion', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybridomas', 'Image', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nobel Prize', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Phage Display', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheromone', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Western Blotting', 'Yeasts', 'addiction', 'antibody engineering', 'antibody libraries', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'cancer therapy', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'decision research', 'design', 'empowered', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanobodies', 'new technology', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'scaffold', 'structural biology', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2020,1690552,-0.0190980166842342
"THE SEARCH FOR COVID-19 PREVENTION AND CURE: ADDRESSING THE CRITICAL ROLE OF INNATE/ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY BY INTEGRATING NOVEL INFORMATICS, TRANSLATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES, AND ONGOING CLINICAL TRIAL RESEARCH Individual CTSA hubs are leading the national clinical and translational research efforts in developing new approaches to address the COVID-19 pandemic. This crucial role was natural. Long before the current crisis, CTSA hubs were committed to translation, building multidisciplinary teams of investigators and community partners, overcoming regulatory burdens, ensuring quality in clinical and human research, developing transformative informatics, and disruptive technologies for diagnostics and therapeutics. In this proposal, we build on our center’s active participation in meaningful clinical trials (e.g., the NIH Remdesivir RCT), the early creation of a biospecimen repository from COVID-19 patients, institutional commitment and fundraising that led to a $3.5 million pilot fund distribution, a robust and accessible clinical database repository, and the ongoing work of an NCATS-supported CTSA Collaboration Innovation Award (a coalition of the J. Craig Venter Institute, UCSD, UCI, and Stanford) focused on artificial intelligence approaches for the analysis of flow cytometry data. Using the emerging informatics framework of supervised generalized canonical correlation for integrative data analysis, we will link clinical data from COVID-19 patients enrolled in a variety of trials and at various stages of disease with innovative in vitro evaluation of innate and adaptive immunity, an area still poorly understood in SARS-CoV-2 pathology, obtained from patient biospecimens to obtain mechanistic insights of COVID-19 pathogenesis at a systems level. Innate and adaptive immunity are particularly relevant to COVID-19 disease pathogenesis because they play key, but distinct, roles at all phases of the illness (initial tissue-virus interaction; systemic responses; the cell-mediated cytokine storm leading to multi- organ failure and death, likely long after levels of viremia have fallen; and, ultimately, protective immunity). The current CCIA novel flow cytometry informatics research permits elucidation of dynamic cellular immune responses related to the COVID-19 pandemic that were heretofore unobservable. Using Hi-DAFi for mass cytometry analysis, validated informatics pipelines for single cell transcriptomics analysis, and cutting-edge statistical data integration and machine learning strategies tied back to the available clinical data we will be able to discover novel associations between cellular biomarkers and disease state, a particular therapy, and disease mediating factors such as age, health disparities, and the presence of other diseases or conditions like obesity. This information will aid in critical efforts to target new therapies and possibly identify idiosyncratic individual physiologic variables that render certain patients who seem to have no known comorbidities more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 disease. Finally, the robust connection between the UCI hub and both regional and national networks (e.g., BRAID, the coalition of the 5 UC CTSAs, and NCATS Trial Innovation Network) will provide an unprecedented opportunity to rapidly disseminate clinically relevant discoveries and engage the talent and insight of the many clinicians and scientists working tirelessly to end this pandemic.

"National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) is to advance the science of biological networks by creating leading-edge bioinformatic methods, software tools and infrastructure, and by engaging the scientific community in a portfolio of collaboration and training opportunities. Much of biomedical research is dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types and scales, including molecular interactions among genes, proteins, metabolites and drugs; cell communication systems; relationships among genotypes and biological and clinical phenotypes; and patient and social networks. NRNB-supported platforms like Cytoscape are among the most widely used software tools in biology, with tens of thousands of active users, enabling researchers to apply network concepts and data to understand biological systems and how they are reprogrammed in disease.  NRNB’s three Technology Research and Development projects introduce innovative concepts with the potential to transform network biology, transitioning it from a static to a dynamic science (TR&D 1); from flat network diagrams to multi-scale hierarchies of biological structure and function (TR&D 2); and from descriptive interaction maps to predictive and interpretable machine learning models (TR&D 3). In previous funding periods our technology projects have produced novel and highly cited approaches, including network-based biomarkers for stratification of disease, data-driven gene ontologies assembled completely from network data, and deep learning models of cell structure and function built using biological networks as a scaffold.  During the next period of support, we introduce dynamic regulatory networks formulated from single-cell transcriptomics and advanced proteomics data (TR&D 1); substantially improved methodology for the study of hierarchical structure and pleiotropy in biological networks (TR&D 2); and procedures for using networks to seed machine learning models of drug response that are both mechanistically interpretable and transferable across biomedical contexts (TR&D 3). These efforts are developed and applied in close collaboration with outside investigators from 19 Driving Biomedical Projects who specialize in experimental generation of network data, disease biology (cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes), single-cell developmental biology, and clinical trials. TR&Ds are also bolstered by 7 Technology Partnerships in which NRNB scientists coordinate technology development with leading resource-development groups in gene function prediction, mathematics and algorithm development, and biomedical databases. Beyond these driving collaborations, we continually support a broader portfolio of transient (non-driving) research collaborations; organize and lead international meetings including the popular Network Biology track of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference; and deliver a rich set of training opportunities and network analysis protocols. OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We are all familiar with some of the components of biological systems – DNA, proteins, cells, organs, individuals – but understanding biological systems involves more than just cataloging its component parts. It is critical to understand the many interactions of these parts within systems, and how these systems give rise to biological functions and responses and determine states of health and disease.

"Learning to learn in structural biology with deep neural networks Project Summary/Abstract  Deep learning is gaining traction across many elds as a powerful tool. In medicine, there have been recent successes in drug design, predicting protein structure, and in functional genomics. These successes have thus far been in areas where there are hundreds of thousands of data points and deep learning in medicine is still limited by lack of large homongeous datasets.  This proposal focuses on applying a new kind of deep learning called meta-learning that mimics the human-like ability to learn from few examples. The PI will establish a sustainable research program on meta-learning by developing benchmark problems and datasets. The PI will further explore meta-learning speci cally on peptide-protein structure and NMR spectra prediction. Due to the imperative need for interpretability when using deep learning in medicine, a strong component will be connecting biophysical modeling with the deep learning models.  The outcome of this work will be a demonstrated new approach to deep learning that can work with little data. The PI will bring these research ideas together to design peptides that can bind to intrinsically disordred proteins, a challenging but important task for curing neurodegenerative diseases. This will be accomplished through meta-learning, molecular simulation, and iterative peptide design. Project Narrative  Deep learning is a technique from arti cial intelligence that has driven many high-pro le break- throughs in recognizing objects in images, translating human languages, and playing games like Chess and Go. Its use is medicine is currently limited by deep learning's need for large amounts of data and its lack of interpretability.

"AI platform for microscopy image restoration and virtual staining AI Platform for Microscopy Image Restoration and Virtual Staining Project Summary:  Fluorescence microscopy has enabled many major discoveries in biomedical sciences. Despite the rapid advancements in optics, lasers, probes, cameras and novel techniques, major factors such as spatial and temporal resolution, light exposure, signal-to-noise, depth of penetration and probe spectra continue to limit the types of experiments that are possible. Deep learning (DL) algorithms are well suited for image-based problems like SNR/super-resolution restoration and virtual staining, which have great enabling potentials for microscopy experiments. Previously impossible experiments could be realized such as achieving high signal-to-noise and/or spatial-temporal resolution without photobleaching/phototoxicity; simultaneously observing many image channels without interfering with native processes, etc. This could pave the way for a quantum leap forward in microscopy-based discoveries that elucidate biological functions and the mechanisms of disorders, and enable new diagnostics and therapies for human diseases.  However, these new methods have not been widely translated to new microscopy experiments. The delay is due to several practical hurdles and challenges such as required expertise, computing and trust. In order to accelerate the adoption of DL in microscopy, novel AI platform tailored for biologists are needed for training, applying and validating DL models and outputs.  The present project aims to develop an AI platform for microscopy image restoration and virtual staining called AI for Restoring and Staining (AIRS) platform. With our collaborator, Dr. Hari Shroff (National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering) we have successfully created DL models for SNR restoration, super-resolution restoration and virtual staining for a variety of imaging conditions and organelles in our preliminary studies. The AIRS platform intends to (1)provide a comprehensive suite of validated DL models for microscopy restoration and virtual staining applications including SNR restoration, super-resolution restoration, spatial deconvolution, spectral unmixing, prediction of 3d from 2d images, organelle virtual staining and analysis; (2)provide plug and play for common microscopy experiments; (3)provide semi-automatic update training to tailor DL models to match advanced microscopy experiments; (4)provide user friendly support for new DL model training for pioneering microscopy experiments; (5)provide confidence scores to assess the output results by a DL model, (6) provide DL models that avoid image artifact (hallucination) and allow continuous learning and evolution; (7) and be able to access the required computing infrastructure and database connection. Project Narrative Deep learning (DL) algorithms have great enabling potentials for microscopy experiments. Previously impossible experiments could now be realized. This could pave the way for a quantum leap forward in microscopy-based discoveries.  Powered by deep learning and DRVision innovations and collaborating with Dr. Hari Shroff and 7 additional labs, this project aims to create an AI platform for microscopy image restorations and virtual staining called AI for restoring and staining (AIRS).

"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,10136941,R44DA050155,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Epidemic', 'Government', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New England', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Program Description', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual system structure', 'addiction', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'literature citation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid therapy', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'synthetic opioid', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2020,746725,-0.024268635785638065
"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data Project Abstract/Summary Our interdisciplinary research team will develop algorithms to accelerate the detection of respiratory virus outbreaks at an unprecedented local scale in US cities. We propose to advance outbreak detection by combining machine learning data integration methods and spatial models of disease transmission. The dynamic models that will be developed will provide mechanistic engines for distinguishing typical from atypical disease trends and the optimization methods evaluate the informativeness of data sources to achieve specified public health goals through the rapid evaluation of diverse input data sources. Working with local healthcare and public health leaders, we will translate the algorithms into user-friendly online tools to support preparedness plans and decision-making. Our proposed research is organized around three major aims. In Aim 1, we will apply machine learning and signal processing methods to build systems that track the earliest indicators of emerging outbreaks within seven US cities. We will evaluate non-clinical data reflecting early and mild symptoms as well as clinical data covering underserved communities and geographic and demographic hotspots for viral emergence. In Aim 2, we will develop sub-city scale models reflecting the syndemics of co-circulating respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) that can exacerbate viral infections. We will infer viral transmission rates and socio-environmental risk cofactors by fitting the model to respiratory disease data extracted from millions of electronic health records (EHRs) for the last nine years. We will then partner with clinical and EHR experts to translate our models into the first outbreak detection system for severe respiratory viruses that incorporates EHR data on CRDs. Using machine learning techniques, we will further integrate other surveillance, environmental, behavioral and internet predictor data sources to maximize the accuracy, sensitivity, speed and population coverage of our algorithms. In Aim 3, we will develop an open-access Python toolkit to facilitate the integration of next generation data into outbreak surveillance models. This project will produce practical early warning algorithms for detecting emerging viral threats at high spatiotemporal resolution in several US cities, elucidate socio-geographic gaps in current surveillance systems and hotspots for viral emergence, and provide a robust design framework for extrapolating these algorithms to other US cities. Project Narrative We will develop innovative algorithms for detecting emerging respiratory viruses within US cities. To do so, we will model the syndemic dynamics of respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases and apply machine learning to combine geospatial data that track early indicators of emerging threats. Working with local public health and healthcare collaborators, we will translate this research into practical tools for addressing socio- geographic gaps in surveillance and accelerating the detection, prevention and mitigation of severe outbreaks.","Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data",9946212,R01AI151176,"['Absenteeism', 'Address', 'African', 'Age', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articulation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease model', 'Ebola', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'austin', 'base', 'cofactor', 'comorbidity', 'dashboard', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'diverse data', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiological model', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'health care availability', 'health goals', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pandemic disease', 'public health intervention', 'respiratory virus', 'school district', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'social media', 'sociodemographic group', 'socioeconomics', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'user-friendly', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,611043,-0.03700174708419915
"Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium Project Summary/Abstract The Arkansas Research Alliance proposes to hold five annual workshops on the subject of bioinformatics. The purpose is to bring six major Arkansas institutions into closer collaboration. Those institutions are: University of Arkansas-Fayetteville; Arkansas State University; University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas at Little Rock; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff; and the National Center for Toxicological Research. The workshops will focus on capabilities at each of the six in sciences related to bioinformatics including artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, food and agriculture, high speed computing, and visualization capabilities. As this work progresses, educational coordination and student encouragement will be important components. Principals from all six institutions are collaborating to accomplish the workshop goals. Project Narrative The FDA ability to protect the public health is directly related to its ability to access and utilize the latest scientific data. Increased proficiency in collecting, presenting, validating, understanding, and drawing quantitative inference from the massive volume of new scientific results is necessary for success in that effort. The complexity involved requires continued development of new tools available and being developed within the realm of information technology, and the workshops proposed here will address this need. Specific Aims  • Thoroughly understand the resources in Arkansas available for furthering the capabilities in  bioinformatics and its associated needs, e.g., access to high speed computing capability and use  of computational tools. • Develop a set of plans to harness and grow those capabilities, especially those that are relevant  to the needs of NCTR and FDA. • Stimulate interest and capability across Arkansas in bioinformatics to produce a larger cadre of  expertise as these plans are implemented. • Enlist NCTR’s help in directing the effort toward seeking local, national and international data  that can be more effectively analyzed to produce results needed by FDA and others, e.g.,  reviewing decades of genomic/treatment data on myeloma patients at the University of  Arkansas for Medical Sciences. • Develop ways in which the Arkansas capabilities can be combined into a coordinated, synergistic  force larger than the sum of its parts. • Encourage students and faculty in the development of new models and techniques to be used in  bioinformatics and related fields. • Improve inter-institutional communication, including developing standardized bioinformatics  curricula and more universal course acceptance.",Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium,9961522,R13FD006690,[' '],FDA,ARKANSAS RESEARCH ALLIANCE,R13,2020,15000,-0.027101482806880656
"Automatic analysis of 3D skin images for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) severity assessment Project Summary More than 20,000 hematopoietic stem cell transplants (including bone marrow transplants) are performed in the U.S. each year to cure a range of diseases ranging from leukemias to sickle cell anemia to autoimmune deficiencies in children. Unfortunately, most long-term non-relapse survivors will die of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), which remains a disease of steadily increasing incidence and profound unmet need. A fundamental barrier in cGVHD management and research is a lack of sensitive and objective assessment tools that permit objective and reproducible measures of disease severity and progression. Skin is the most commonly affected organ in cGVHD and automated techniques capable of measuring precisely the surface area of involved skin in photographs may provide the tools necessary for effectively evaluating patient progress. We propose to (1) create the data set necessary to develop machine learning-based methods for the automatic analysis of cGVHD images, and (2) implement and evaluate these methods. Project Narrative  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a lethal disease that affects most long-term hematopoietic stem cell transplant (including bone marrow transplants) recipients. Skin images are used to assess disease severity and progression but the technology required to quantitatively and reproducibly analyze these images is lacking.

"Improving the representativeness of American Indian Tribal Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (TBRFSS) by machine learning and propensity score based data integration approach A1 PROJECT SUMMARY Previous studies showed discrepancies of health and behavior prevalence between American Indians (AI) population and other racial or ethnic groups. Most health surveys have certain limitations when studying AI population due to the small sample sizes for AI population. Data collected by AI Tribal Epidemiology Centers (TECs) provides an excellent opportunity to conduct research for AI population due to sufficient sample size and extensive information. However, most surveys conducted by TECs used non-probability sampling design (e.g. convenient sample) due to its lower cost and increased time efficiency. Non-probability sample may suffer from sampling, coverage and nonresponse errors without further proper adjustments. Such difficulties greatly hampers the analysis of AI population in health and behavior research. Our general hypothesis is that data integration by combining information from non-probability and probability samples can reduce sampling, coverage and nonresponse errors in original non-probability sample. The Goal of this project is to develop an accurate and robust data integration methodology for AI population analysis specifically tailored to health and behavior research. During the past years, we have 1) studied data integration using calibration and parametric modeling approaches; 2) investigated machine learning and propensity score modeling methods in survey sampling and other fields; and 3) assembled an experienced team of multi-disciplinary team of experts. In this project, we propose to capitalize on our expertise and fulfill the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a data integration approach using machine learning and propensity score modeling We will develop machine learning and propensity score based data integration approaches to combine information from non-probability and probability samples. Compared to existing methods (i.e., Calibration, Parametric approach), our proposed approaches are more robust against the failure of underlying model assumptions. The inference is more general and multi-purpose (e.g. one can estimate most parameters such as means, totals and percentiles). Simulation studies will be performed to compare our proposed methods with other existing methods. A computing package will be built to implement the method in other settings. Aim 2. Evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method in AI health and behavior research We will use real data to validate the proposed methods in terms of accuracy and robustness to the various data types. The performance will also be assessed by comparing with results from existing data integration methods such as calibration and parametric modeling approaches. The planned study takes advantage of a unique data source and expands the impact of the Indian Health Service (IHS)-funded research. We expect this novel integration method will vertically advance the field by facilitating the analysis based on non-probability sample, which can provide in-depth understanding regarding the AI population health and behavior studies. Project Narrative The overall goal of this R21 project is to develop an accurate, robust and multi-purpose data integration methodology for AI population (non-probability sample) analysis specifically tailored to health and behavior research such as diabetes and smoking. The code implementing the proposed method will be released and is general enough to be applied to AI population studies of other fileds. The success of this study will vertically advance the field by facilitating the AI population analysis, which can provide a better guidance and new insights on the future precision personalized prevention and treatment of certain diseases.",Improving the representativeness of American Indian Tribal Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (TBRFSS) by machine learning and propensity score based data integration approach A1,10063407,R21MD014658,"['Adult', 'Age', 'American', 'American Indians', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Calibration', 'Censuses', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geographic state', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Fairs', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'High Prevalence', 'Kansas', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oklahoma', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Probability Samples', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respondent', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'United States Indian Health Service', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cigarette smoking', 'cluster computing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data quality', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'simulation', 'smoking prevalence', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tribal health']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R21,2020,115176,-0.011214370237963126
"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems. The project describes a new mathematical data analysis approach, rooted on transport and related phenomena, which is aimed at greatly enhance our ability to extract meaning from diverse biomedical datasets, while augmenting the accuracy of predictions.",Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science,9874005,R01GM130825,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cartilage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Visualization', 'absorption', 'algorithm development', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biophysical properties', 'brain morphology', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effectiveness testing', 'electric impedance', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'gray matter', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical theory', 'microscopic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'neural network', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,360227,-0.00861942770125119
"An Integrated Software Platform for Accelerating Image-Driven Ophthalmic Research and Driving New Insights and Endpoints to the Clinic ABSTRACT More than 20 million patients suffer from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma. These degenerative eye diseases develop over decades, and their prevalence is increasing. Retinal imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography and adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy are essential tools in the investigation and management of eye disease. New quantitative biomarkers derived from these and other imaging modalities are critical to the clinical translation of emerging ophthalmic innovations. However, biomarker development in the era of artificial intelligence requires large volumes of annotated images and transparent, reproducible processes, which places new demands on the management of living subjects research, data sharing, and algorithm development. Unfortunately, current software platforms are not effective in integrating these data in a manner that meets specific requirements in ophthalmology, Our goal in this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR, consistent with objectives of the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science, is to create an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, analysis, and sharing of ocular images and data. We will extend the capabilities of systems developed by the Advanced Ocular Imaging Program (AOIP), Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), which include: (a) LATTICE - a software solution that reduces costs, reduces errors, and improves communications in the management of living-subjects research; (b) MOSAIC - an image processing platform and algorithm library with traditional and AI-trained algorithms; and (c) The AOIP Image Bank - a Repository that houses images and data on 1578 fully-consent human research subjects. To create the integrative platform, we will address four aims: (a) Extend LATTICE to meet the workflow requirements of academic and sponsored research in local and multisite environments, including the extensible direct integration of data relevant to ocular studies; (b) Design and implement a hybrid (local + cloud) REPOSITORY architecture, data schema, knowledge ontology, and query architecture for Owners and Readers of data.; (c) Integrate and demonstrate LATTICE, REPOSITORY and MOSAIC into a continuous ocular science workflow and (d) integrate and demonstrate Lattice, Repository and Mosaic into a continuous ocular science workflow. Our Integrated Translational Imaging platform will enable ophthalmic innovators to translate sight-saving insights and interventions to the clinic faster, with less frustration, and greater confidence. Our proposal fills an important technology gap in the field of ophthalmic data science and biomarker development. While the number and type of imaging devices continues to grow, the tools to develop and deploy new biomarkers and clinical endpoints using these exquisite imaging devices has not kept pace. With this program we will enable a new generation of image-driven innovation to find its way to the clinic. Project Narrative With more than 20 million patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma, it is crucial to develop non-invasive biomarkers as early predictors of eye disease and reliable tests of the safety and efficacy of new preventative and restorative therapies. To meet the unmet need for rapid access and analysis of ophthalmic research data for the discovery of these biomarkers, we will create an integrated platform (PaaS) for the collection, curation, sharing, and analysis of ocular images and data. If we meet our objectives, our platform will reduce the cost of clinical research and increase the speed of translating critical research insights to saving the sight of millions of patients.",An Integrated Software Platform for Accelerating Image-Driven Ophthalmic Research and Driving New Insights and Endpoints to the Clinic,9908389,R44EY031198,"['Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Docking', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundations', 'Frustration', 'Funding', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Human Subject Research', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Mosaicism', 'Ontology', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Wisconsin', 'adaptive optics', 'algorithm development', 'algorithm training', 'application programming interface', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fighting', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging program', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'microsystems', 'ocular imaging', 'process repeatability', 'programs', 'repository', 'retinal imaging', 'safety testing', 'software systems', 'structured data', 'tool', 'verification and validation', 'vision science']",NEI,"TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING INNOVATIONS, INC.",R44,2020,743347,-0.022104126081272463
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: expanding dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches for pandemic scenarios PROJECT SUMMARY The emergence and global expansion of SARS-CoV-2 as a human pathogen over the last four months represents a nearly unprecedented challenge for the infectious disease modelling community. This pandemic has benefitted from huge volumes of data being generated, but the rate of dissemination of these data has often outpaced existing data pipelines. While the last decade has seen significant advances in real-time infectious disease forecasting — spurred by rapid growth in data and computational methods — these methods have primarily focused on seasonal endemic diseases based, are based on historical data, and so do not apply easily to this novel pathogen, or to pandemic scenarios. New methods are needed to leverage the wealth of surveillance data at fine spatial granularity, together with associated information about policy interventions and environmental conditions over space and time, to reason directly about the mechanisms to forecast and understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These methods must use sound statistical and epidemiological principles and be flexible and computationally efficient to provide real- time forecasts to guide public health decision-making and respond to changing aspects of this global crisis. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop scalable, computationally efficient Bayesian hierarchical compartmental models to flexibly respond to state-level public health forecasting needs, and (2) to design models and conduct analyses to draw robust inference about the effectiveness of interventions in impacting the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections within the US to build an evidence-base for continued responses to COVID-19 and future pandemics. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an emerging public health crisis. A fundamental challenge is how to turn data into evidence that can inform decision-making about managing resources, improving health outcomes, and controlling further spread of SARS-CoV-2. Real-time forecasting and flexible mechanistic models to understand the disease dynamics can provide policy-makers tools to manage public response. The goal of the proposed research is to adapt existing statistical modeling frameworks and develop new ones for making forecasts of COVID-19 in real-time and integrating these forecasts into public health decision making.",Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: expanding dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches for pandemic scenarios,10150377,R35GM119582,"['2019-nCoV', 'Award', 'Budgets', 'COVID-19', 'Calibration', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Fever', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Endemic Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza prevention', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Social Distance', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thailand', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'data dissemination', 'data pipeline', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'influenza epidemic', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid growth', 'real world application', 'reproductive', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'sound', 'statistical and machine learning', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R35,2020,78507,-0.02735273931694365
"Image-guided robot for high-throughput microinjection of Drosophila embryos PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is submitted in response to the NIH Development of Animal Models and Related Biological Materials for Research (R21) program. The proposal develops an image-guided robotic platform that performs the automated delivery of molecular genetic tools and non-genetically encoded reagents such as chemical libraries, fluorescent dyes to monitor cellular processes, functionalized magnetic beads, or nanoparticles into thousands of Drosophila embryos in a single experimental session. The proposed work builds on recent engineering innovations in our collaborative group which has developed image-guided robotic systems that can precisely interface with single cells in intact tissue. The two Specific Aims provide for a systematic development of the proposed technologies. AIM 1 first engineers a robotic platform (‘Autoinjector’) that can scan and image Drosophila embryos in arrays of egg laying plates. We will utilize machine learning algorithms for automated detection of embryos, followed by thresholding and morphology analysis to detect embryo centroids and annotate injection sites. In AIM 2, we will utilize microprocessor-controlled fluidic circuits for programmatic delivery of femtoliter to nanoliter volumes of reagents into individual embryos. We will quantify the efficacy of the Autoinjector by comparing the survival, fertility, and transformation rates of transposon or PhiC31-mediated transgenesis to manual microinjection datasets. Finally, we will demonstrate the efficient delivery of sgRNAs and mutagenesis in the presence of Cas9. This project fits very well within the goals of the program by engineering a novel tool for producing and improving animal models. The Autoinjector will accelerate Drosophila research and empower scientists to perform novel experiments and genome-scale functional genomics screens that are currently too inefficient or labor intensive to be conducted on a large scale and may additionally enable other novel future applications.

"DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation Contact PD/PI: Fereidouni, Farzad Abstract Kidneys, like other organs, have an inherent capacity to recover from acute injury; however, severe or recurrent injury can result in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the sequelae of which result in 82,000 deaths annually in the US alone. Regardless of the etiology of the initial injury, the common final pathway leading to- end stage renal disease is closely connected to fibrosis(excess or aberrant collagen distribution), one of the most important determinants of renal disease severity and prognosis. Histology is the gold standard for evaluation, typically through the use of histochemical stains such as trichrome and PAS that highlight the presence of collagens and basement membrane, respectively. Nevertheless, these stains are not completely specific, can be technically challenging to perform well and reproducibly, and thus contribute to interobserver variability and a concomitant decrease in diagnostic precision. Moreover, they also require the preparation of extra slides and additional staining procedures, and thus increase cost and can prolong the diagnostic process. We propose to optimize, deploy and test a new kind of microscope, DUET (DUal mode Emission and Transmission microscopy), developed at UC Davis, that will be a low-cost and very rapid solution for detection and digital characterization of the presence and distribution of collagen and other macromolecules, directly from standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Specifically, we will finalize the design of the hardware and software components of the instrument itself, validate imaging performance against standard histology and immunohistochemical stains for collagen and other components, and with the assistance of scientists at our partnering institutions (John Hopkins University and University of Buffalo) develop robust tools for analysis and quantitation of fibrosis. DUET instrument hardware will be shared with JHU to ensure that the methods are technically reproducible across multiple sites. The application leverages the expertise across three institutions in optics, biomedical engineering, renal pathology and novel artificial intelligence approaches. The goal of the project is development and validation of DUET, which promises to be a robust, inexpensive and practical approach for the rapid and accurate evaluation of fibrosis, extensible to other renal pathologies, and indeed across other organs systems, with significant positive impact on disease research, clinical practice, and patient outcomes. Page 6 Project Summary/Abstract Project Narrative Evaluation of fibrosis and tubular atrophy from chemically stained kidney biopsies are essential for diagnosis and disease-severity assessment, but current techniques are time-consuming, somewhat non-specific and contribute to interobserver variability and imprecision, affecting care. We propose to optimize and test a new kind of microscope (“DUET”) that can visualize fibrosis (scarring) and other tissue abnormalities directly from standard slides to enable high-quality reproducible fibrosis scoring and evaluation. This multi-site project will also provide a unique opportunity to perform a retrospective study from hundreds of existing H&E slides with associated months to years of clinical follow-up data, and to create a method with demonstrated utility in more than one institution.",DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation,10261643,R56DK124873,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Basement membrane', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Buffaloes', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrillar Collagen', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Natural History', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirius Red F3B', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Trichrome stain method', 'Tubular formation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'follow-up', 'histological stains', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney fibrosis', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'software development', 'stem', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2020,91725,-0.07932345660917435
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement. The technology we propose will also contribute to the sharing of predictive models in ways that meet the needs of genomic research and healthcare.",BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy,9920181,R00HG009680,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Authorization documentation', 'Award', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Databases', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fibrinogen', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Institutional Policy', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'blockchain', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'open source', 'peer', 'peer networks', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'privacy preservation', 'privacy protection', 'programs', 'public trust', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'trend', 'web portal', 'web services']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R00,2020,249000,-0.013497076762975424
"Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository Three-dimensional anatomic modeling and simulation (3D M&S) in cardiovascular (CV) disease have become a crucial component of treatment planning, medical device design, diagnosis, and FDA approval. Comprehensive, curated 3-D M&S databases are critical to enable grand challenges, and to advance model reduction, shape analysis, and deep learning for clinical application. However, large-scale open data curation involving 3-D M&S present unique challenges; simulations are data intensive, physics-based models are increasingly complex and highly resolved, heterogeneous solvers and data formats are employed by the community, and simulations require significant high-performance computing resources. Manually curating a large open-data repository, while ensuring the contents are verified and credible, is therefore intractable. We aim to overcome these challenges by developing broadly applicable automated curation data science to ensure model credibility and accuracy in 3-D M&S, leveraging our team’s expertise in CV simulation, uncertainty quantification, imaging science, and our existing open data and open source projects. Our team has extensive experience developing and curating open data and software resources. In 2013, we launched the Vascular Model Repository (VMR), providing 120 publicly-available datasets, including medical image data, anatomic vascular models, and blood flow simulation results, spanning numerous vascular anatomies and diseases. The VMR is compatible with SimVascular, the only fully open source platform providing state-of-the-art image-based blood flow modeling and analysis capability to the CV simulation community. We propose that novel curation science will enable the VMR to rapidly intake new data while automatically assessing model credibility, creating a unique resource to foster rigor and reproducibility in the CV disease community with broad application in 3D M&S. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims: 1) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of anatomic patient-specific models built from medical image data, 2) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of 3D blood flow simulation results, 3) Disseminate the data curation suite and expanded VMR. The proposed research is significant and innovative because it will 1) enable rapid expansion of the repository by limiting curator intervention during data intake, leveraging compatibility with SimVascular, 2) increase model credibility in the CV simulation community, 3) apply novel supervised and unsupervised approaches to evaluate anatomic model fidelity, 4) leverage reduced order models for rapid assessment of complex 3D data. This project assembles a unique team of experts in cardiovascular simulation, the developers of SimVascular and creator of the VMR, a professional software engineer, and radiology technologists. We will build upon our successful track record of launching and supporting open source and open data resources to ensure success. Data curation science for 3D M&S will have direct and broad impacts in other physiologic systems and to ultimately impact clinical care in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular anatomic models and blood flow simulations are increasingly used for personalized surgical planning, medical device design, and the FDA approval process. We propose to develop automated data curation science to rapidly assess credibility of anatomic models and 3D simulation data, which present unique challenges for large-scale data curation. Leveraging our open source SimVascular project, the proposed project will enable rapid expansion of the existing Vascular Model Repository while ensuring model credibility and reproducibility to foster innovation in clinical and basic science cardiovascular research.",Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository,10016840,R01LM013120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Basic Science', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Engineering', 'Source Code', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'computing resources', 'data curation', 'data format', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gigabyte', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'online repository', 'open data', 'open source', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'stem', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'supervised learning', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'unsupervised learning', 'web portal']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,330502,0.005610297748064459

ICARUS will use machine learning applied to content-based image retrieval - (CBIR) to build and refine models that summarize microscopic and macroscopic image appearance and automatically assign semantic concepts to neuroimages. Neuroscience research generates extensive, multifaceted data that is considerably under-utilized because access to original raw data is typically maintained by the source lab. On the other hand, there are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results. Unfortunately, none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists. To solve this problem, NeuroManager will include the following distinct, significant innovations: (i) versatility for handling two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional neuroimaging data sets from animal models and humans; (ii) functionality to share complex datasets that extends secure, privacy-controlled paradigms from institutional, laboratory-based and even public domains; (iii) flexibility to implement NeuroManager within an institute’s IT infrastructure, or on most cloud-based virtualized environments including Azure, Google Cloud Services and Amazon Web Services; (iv) and most importantly, the ICARUS technology for CBIR in neuroimaging data sets. The benefit of NeuroManager for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be to foster collaboration between scientists and institutions, promoting innovation through combined expertise in an interdisciplinary atmosphere. This will open new horizons for better understanding the neuropathology associated with several human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions at various levels (i.e., macroscopically, microscopically, subcellularly and functionally), ultimately leading to an improved basis for developing novel treatment and prevention strategies for complex brain diseases. In Phase I we will prove feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype software that will perform CBIR on 2D whole slide images of coronal sections of entire mouse brains from ongoing research projects of our collaborators. Work in Phase II will focus on developing the commercial software product that will include all of the innovations mentioned above. A competing technology with comparable functionality, addressing the full breadth of needs for modern neuroscience research, is currently not available commercially or otherwise. There are many advantages in sharing complex image data in neuroscience research, including the opportunity for separate analysis of raw data by other scientists from another perspective and improved reproducibility of scientific studies and their results; however none of the neuroscience data sharing options that exist today fulfill all the needs of neuroscientists. This project commercializes an innovative software for sophisticated advanced parsing, storing, aggregating, analyzing and sharing of complex neuroscience image data, including a novel, intelligent neuroimage curation system that will enable content-based neuroscience image search powered by machine learning, thereby opening new horizons in neuroscience research collaborations. This system will allow researchers to make new discoveries based on new studies that are currently not feasible, ultimately providing the basis for developing novel treatments to prevent and fight complex brain diseases.",Neuroinformatics platform using machine learning and content-based image retrieval for neuroscience image data,9989186,R44MH118815,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Appearance', 'Archives', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Cloud Service', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Files', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Dimensions', 'Fostering', 'Human', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Prevention strategy', 'Privacy', 'Problem Solving', 'Production', 'Public Domains', 'Records', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Subjects', 'Retrieval', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cloud based', 'collaborative environment', 'data access', 'data format', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'fighting', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropathology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'stem cells', 'treatment strategy', 'two-dimensional', 'usability', 'virtual environment', 'web services', 'whole slide imaging']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2020,749716,-0.013643167573411125
"Nobrainer: A robust and validated neural network tool suite for imagers There is an increasing need for efficient and robust software to process, integrate, and offer insight across the diversity of population imaging efforts underway across the BRAIN Initiative and other projects. Advances in statistical learning offer a set of technologies that can address many research applications using the extensive and varied data being produced by the projects. This can transform how we analyze and integrate new data. We propose using Nobrainer, an open source Python library that leverages these new learning technologies, as a platform that greatly simplifies integrating deep learning into neuroimaging research. Using this library, we are building and distributing user-friendly and cloud enabled end-user applications for the neuroimaging community. In Aim 1, we provide neural network models. We will create robust, pre-trained neural networks for brain segmentation and time series processing using brain scans from over 65000 individuals. Once trained, these models can then be used as the basis for many other applications, especially in reducing time of processing. We will subsequently use these base networks to perform image processing, image correction, and quality control. In Aim 2, we address the ability to train on private datasets. We will use Bayesian neural network models, which support principled use of prior information. We will use these networks to help detect when the models are expected to fail on an input, and provide visualizations to better understand how the model is working. In Aim 3, we focus on the engineering needed to maintain the software infrastructure, improve efficiency, and increase the scalability of our training methods. Here, we will extend, maintain, and disseminate Nobrainer, our open source software framework, together with training materials and ready to use, cloud-friendly, applications. We will also create much faster, neural network equivalents of time consuming image processing tasks (e.g., registration, segmentation, and annotation). The Nobrainer tools developed through these aims will allow users to find and apply the most pertinent applications and developers to extend the framework to support new architectures and disseminate new models and applications. We expect these tools to be used by any neuroimaging researcher through integration with BRAIN archives and popular software packages. These tools will significantly reduce data processing and new model development time, thus allowing faster exploration of hypotheses using public data and increase reusability of data through greater trust in model outputs. 9/11/2019 ResearchPlan - Google Docs The proposal will create artificial intelligence software for scientists to analyze, integrate, and visualize data from large brain imaging projects, which inform our understanding of brain structure, function, and development. Open and reusable software helps to increase collaboration and benefits researchers, but can also be used by citizen scientists and students in high schools and colleges. An open collection of neural network tools will facilitate scientific communities and has the potential to accelerate scientific discoveries about the nervous system. https://docs.google.com/document/d/11s9ZRzy8tHs6NguzpnJdJUWRgLvdkXpEYjZchtJXSmY/edit# 2/23",Nobrainer: A robust and validated neural network tool suite for imagers,10021957,RF1MH121885,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bayesian neural network', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Libraries', 'Longevity', 'Memory', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Pythons', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cognitive development', 'college', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'data reuse', 'deep learning', 'distributed data', 'diverse data', 'high school', 'image processing', 'imager', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'network models', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'software infrastructure', 'statistical learning', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,RF1,2020,419908,-0.023662198330597004
"Learning Dynamics of Biological Processes from Time Course Omics Datasets Complex biological processes, including organ development, immune response and disease progression, are inherently dynamic. Learning their regulatory architecture requires understanding how components of a large system dynamically interact with each other and give rise to emergent behavior. Recent experimental advances have made ii possible to investigate these biological systems in a data-driven fashion al high temporal resolution, allowing identification of new genes and their regulatory interactions. Longitudinal omics data sets are becoming increasingly common in clinical practice as well. Information on these collections of interacting genes can be integrated to gain systems-level insights into the roles of biological pathways and processes, including progression of diseases. Consequently, developing interpretable methods for learning functional relationships among genes, proteins or metabolites from high-dimensional time series data has become a timely research problem. The nature of these time-course data sets presents exciting opportunities and interesting challenges from a statistical perspective. Typical time-course omics data sets are challenging because of their high-dimensionality and non-linear relationships among system components. To tackle these challenges, one needs sophisticated dimension-reduction techniques that are biologically meaningful, computationally efficient and allow uncertainty quantification. Methods that incorporate prior biological information (e.g., pathway membership, protein-protein interactions) into the data analysis are good candidates for analyzing such high-dimensional systems using small samples. Here, we will develop three core methods to address the above challenges - (Aim 1): an empirical Bayes framework for clustering high-dimensional omics time-course data using prior biological knowledge; (Aim 2): a quantile-based Granger causality framework for learning interactions among genes or metabolites from their lead-lag relationships; and (Aim 3): a decision tree ensemble framework for searching cascades of interactions among genes from their temporal expression profiles. Our interdisciplinary team of statisticians and scientists will analyze time-course omics data from three research projects: (i) innate immune response systems in Drosophila, (ii) developmental process in mouse models, and (ii) longitudinal metabolite profiling of TB patients. These insights will be used to build and validate our methodology, which will be implemented in a publicly available software. This proposal is innovative in its incorporation of prior biological knowledge in the framework of novel dimension reduction techniques for interrogating high-dimensional time-course omics data. This research is significant in that it will impact basic sciences by elucidating data-driven, testable hypotheses on the regulatory architecture of biological processes, and clinical practice by monitoring disease progression and prognosis. n/a",Learning Dynamics of Biological Processes from Time Course Omics Datasets,10021429,R01GM135926,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Drosophila genus', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Grouping', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'clinical practice', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'open source', 'organ growth', 'outcome forecast', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'temporal measurement']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,344345,-0.02315739644982839
"Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis is a major health concern with over 200 million people with active urogenital or ocular infection each year worldwide. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria with a unique biphasic developmental cycle. A better understanding of that biphasic cycle can lead to inhibitors that are specific for chlamydial infection in order to avoid overuse of antibiotics. Individual Chlamydia are too small and tightly packed to be spatially separated with conventional light microscopes, and 3D SEM is too labor-intensive for inhibitor studies. We will use a new sample preparation method that physically expands the sample with polymers termed ""Expansion Microscopy"" or ExM. Expanded samples can then be imaged with a traditional confocal microscope, and high-content analysis performed automatically using machine learning methods such as pixel classification and novelty detection. Prepared samples can be imaged and analyzed in under an hour instead of the multiple days required for 3D SEM. This R03 grant will develop an innovative high-content screening platform, called Expansion Microscopy Aided Phenotyping (ExMAP), for the quantification of changes in Chlamydia development after treatment. ExMAP can be paired with Chlamydia transformed with promoters for EUO and IhtA (RB cell types) and the promoters for HctB and Tarp (EB cell types). The combination of expansion microscopy, machine learning, and chlamydial transformation will make ExMAP a powerful tool for research on both the developmental cycle and new therapy development. Project Narrative This project will develop a new high-content platform, termed ExMAP, that will physically expand the sample of interest and then utilize machine learning for image analysis. At the completion of the project, we expect to have developed a new method for the study of the Chlamydia developmental cycle and inhibitors that disrupt that cycle.",Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions,9979523,R03AI146437,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acrylates', 'Aftercare', 'Agonist', 'Antibiotics', 'Applications Grants', 'Bacteria', 'Cells', 'Chlamydia', 'Chlamydia Infections', 'Chlamydia genome', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Chloramphenicol', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Eye Infections', 'Gel', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron Chelating Agents', 'Lead', 'Light Microscope', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'PF4 Gene', 'Penicillins', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polymers', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sodium', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chlamydia vaccine', 'human pathogen', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'promoter', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIAID,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,77243,-0.03824679784367774
"A Novel Cryopreservation Technology for Large Skin Grafts to Facilitate Tissue Banking and Allograft Transplantations SUMMARY As a result of recent and rapid advances of immunogenetical, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies, the accuracy and efficiency of donor-recipient immunogenetical matching are expected to be significantly improved. As such, traditional tissue banking practices are being severely challenged due to low cryopreservation throughput. Skin allograft transplantations are currently utilized for numerous clinical applications. In such applications, donor tissues are now typically utilized as “expensive bandages”, i.e. for temporary coverage, thereby requiring painful and damaging follow-on autotransplantation procedures. With tremendously improved skin graft cryopreservation methods coupled with use of HLA matching based on AI network, future tissue banking platforms can potentially provide grafts to be used as permanent and definitive treatment for patients, thereby bringing high impact to clinical applications and the healthcare industry. Based on CryoCrate’s novel ultra-fast (106 K/min on a sample surface) cooling technology platform (PCT/US2019/26162), this project aims to develop a highly efficient (approaching 100% post-thaw viability) tissue graft cryopreservation prototype system that requires no cryoprotectant. The post-thaw viability and functionality will be assessed by standard in vitro assays using porcine and human skin (research exempt) grafts and in vivo assays using a mouse model. After achieving these aims, in future phase II and III stages, CryoCrate and its academic collaborator will collaborate with a local Organ Procurement Organization (Mid-America Transplant) and a wound healing clinic (University of Missouri Hospital) for porcine and human skin transplantation studies and clinical trials. Narrative A novel skin graft cryopreservation technology that requires no cryoprotectant will be developed to significantly improve efficiencies for tissue banking and allograft transplantation practices. This project initiates collaboration between CryoCrate LLC and local stakeholders, and thereby paves a path to commercialization of a new generation of ultra‐fast tissue cryopreservation devices.",A Novel Cryopreservation Technology for Large Skin Grafts to Facilitate Tissue Banking and Allograft Transplantations,10011745,R43AI155070,"['Allografting', 'Americas', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autologous Transplantation', 'Bandage', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Cryopreservation', 'Cryopreserved Tissue', 'Devices', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Freeze Drying', 'Freezing', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunogenetics', 'Impairment', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'In Vitro', 'Liquid substance', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Organ Procurements', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Skin Transplantation', 'Skin graft', 'Stains', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue Grafts', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical application', 'commercialization', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'invention', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'prototype', 'scale up', 'skin allograft', 'success', 'transplant model', 'two-dimensional', 'wound healing']",NIAID,"CRYOCRATE, LLC",R43,2020,160371,-0.01582486765908493

"An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long- term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se- quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems- level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity (top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de- velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da- tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under- lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr. AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties (e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii) Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i) developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno- logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in- cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine. The proposed research is relevant to public health because B cells/antibodies and T cells play vital roles across such a vast range of health conditions, from infection, to autoimmunity, to cancer, that the ability to de- code what they are doing would be an important step forward for diagnosing these conditions. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission of fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health, specifically relating to the diagnosis of human diseases.",An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics,10050030,R01AI148747,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Fostering', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privatization', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speed', 'Statistical Study', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Cell Receptor Genes', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical diagnostics', 'computerized tools', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human disease', 'immunological diversity', 'improved', 'information model', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'tool']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,535171,-0.04888266543680554
"THE XNAT IMAGING INFORMATICS PLATFORM PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to continue the development of XNAT. XNAT is an imaging informatics platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for imaging and associated data. We will develop the next generation of XNAT technology to support the ongoing evolution of imaging research. Development will focus on modernizing and expanding the current system. In Aim 1, we will implement new web application infrastructure that includes a new archive file management system, a new event bus to manage cross-service orchestration and a new Javascript library to simplify user interface development. We will also implement new core services, including a Docker Container service, a dynamic scripting engine, and a global XNAT federation. In Aim 2, we will implement two innovative new capabilities that build on the services developed in Aim 1. The XNAT Publisher framework will streamline the process of data sharing by automating the creation and curation of data releases following best practices for data publication and stewardship. The XNAT Machine Learning framework will streamline the development and use of machine learning applications by integrating XNAT with the TensorFlow machine learning environment and implementing provenance and other monitoring features to help avoid the pitfalls that often plague machine learning efforts. For both Aim 1 and 2, all capabilities will be developed and evaluated in the context of real world scientific programs that are actively using the XNAT platform. In Aim 3, we will provide extensive support to the XNAT community, including training workshops, online documentation, discussion forums, and . These activities will be targeted at both XNAT users and developers. RELEVANCE Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by biomedical researchers to study human biology in health and disease.

"Multi-Study Integer Programming Methods for Human Voltammery Project Summary/Abstract  The development of treatments for addiction requires the characterization of neural mechanisms underlying reward. Studying reward in humans requires assays that can detect changes in neurotransmitter levels with high chemical specificity. Recently, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) has been implemented in humans to measure dopamine with high temporal and spatial resolution. This technological achievement was enabled in large part through the novel application of machine learning methods. FSCV relies on statistical tools since FSCV records an electrochemical response which must be converted into concentration estimates via a statistical model. The validity of the scientific conclusions from human FSCV studies therefore depends heavily on the reliability of these statistical models to generate accurate dopamine concentration estimates.  In human FSCV, models are fit on in vitro training sets as making in vivo training sets in humans is infeasible. Producing accurate estimates thus requires that models trained on in vitro training sets generalize to in vivo brain recordings. Combining data from multiple training sets is the standard approach human FSCV researchers have employed to improve model generalizability. This proposal extends work that shows that multi-study machine learning methods improve dopamine concentration estimates by combining training sets from different electrodes such that the resulting average signal (“cyclic voltammogram” or CV) is similar to the average CV of the electrode used in the brain. However, this approach relies on random resampling. This is problematic because the randomness limits the extent to which estimate accuracy can be improved and the slow speed of the resampling approach precludes the generation of estimates during data collection, which is critical to experiment success.  This proposal details the development of methods that leverage mixed integer programming to optimally generate training sets that combine data from multiple electrodes. By generating training sets that are specifically tailored to the electrode used for brain measurements, one can vastly improve dopamine concentration estimate accuracy. The speed of the integer programming methods will enable the use of this approach during data collection. This work will include validation of the methods on in vitro data as well as on data from published in vivo and slice experiments in rodents. By applying methods to published optogenetic experiments, one can compare estimates from the proposed methods and from standard methods. The asymptotic properties of the proposed methods will be characterized analytically assuming a linear mixed effects model and empirically through application of the methods to data simulated under this model.  This work will be conducted at the highly collaborative and innovative Harvard School of Public Health. The fellowship will support growth in statistical, computing and collaborative skills, and prepare the trainee for a productive career as a biostatistics professor who develops methods for neuroscience and addiction research. Project Narrative  Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in humans offers an invaluable tool to study the neural mechanisms underlying reward by allowing for sub-second detection of dopamine during cognitive-behavioral tasks. However, conducting voltammetry in humans presents distinct statistical challenges that must be overcome to ensure optimal dopamine concentration estimates. We propose novel statistical methods that use mixed integer optimization and extend preliminary work that shows multi-study machine learning methods substantially improve dopamine concentration estimate accuracy.",Multi-Study Integer Programming Methods for Human Voltammery,10067624,F31DA052153,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Property', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'algorithm training', 'career', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'multiple data sources', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIDA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2020,37235,-0.009904917335116493
"Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop open-source software and algorithms for 3-D reconstruc- tion and multi-scale mapping of normal tissues. Another significant goal is to evaluate effects of aging and envi- ronmental factors on molecular and structural architecture of skin. We will leverage our mature (TRL8) technol- ogy for multiplexed 2-D imaging (Cell DIVE™), and our vast experience in 2-D image analytics and machine learning. We have selected normal skin as the organ to develop these tools for several reasons, a) clinical sam- ples from different age groups are more readily available, b) it is a good model to independently capture changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) due to age and normal exposure to environmental factors as well as a variety of pathogenic insults. While the ECM, cellular and intracellular molecular composition varies considerably among various organs, we believe many of the tools developed under this program will be applicable to reconstruct and map other organ models at high (cellular/subcellular) resolution. This proposal will focus on developing algo- rithms and a framework for multi-scale mapping of 3-D tissue images, which will address HuBMAP priorities around quantitative 3-D image analysis/mapping, including automated 3-D image segmentation, feature ex- traction, and image annotation. High-resolution (subcellular) mapping of biomolecules will be implemented us- ing 2-D multiplexed images that are used to reconstruct the 3-D tissue and linked to a lower resolution 3-D opti- cal coherence tomography (OCT) image of the normal tissue. Other cell-level omic data (e.g., RNA FISH) will be mapped in the same way. The low-resolution image is mapped back to a higher-level landmark (e.g., organ) as defined by the HuBMAP common coordinate framework (CCF). As outlined, our proposed technologies will in- clude several key features that are significant and complimentary to existing HuBMAP consortium projects and will advance the state of the art in 3-D tissue analysis. The proposed algorithms will have several key innova- tions that will advance the state of the art in 3-D multiplexed tissue image analysis. First, given the large vol- umes to be analyzed, high throughput will be a key requirement of each image analysis algorithm. This will be supported by our extensive experience in parallelizing single cell analysis pipelines. Second, the proposed algo- rithms will segment the images at multiple scales. The third area of innovation will focus on efficient multi- channel analysis. The proposed project will include creation of an easy-to-use software tool for assembling and visualizing multiscale tissue data called Tissue Atlas Navigation Graphical Overview (TANGO). PROJECT NARRATIVE Composition and organization of cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) they are embedded in, controls the function of different organs in human body. Alterations in any of these can lead to onset and progression of var- ious diseases. The proposed project will develop image analytics algorithms and open source software for high- resolution 3-D mapping of skin, the largest organ in the human body, and evaluate molecular and architectural changes due to aging and UV exposure.",Multi-Scale 3-D Image Analytics for High Dimensional Spatial Mapping of Normal Tissues,10246250,UH3CA246594,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'California', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human BioMolecular Atlas Program', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multiomic Data', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Organ Model', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Skin Aging', 'Skin Tissue', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age group', 'analysis pipeline', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'high dimensionality', 'image visualization', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging platform', 'innovation', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'multiplexed imaging', 'multiscale data', 'open source', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sample collection', 'single cell analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tomography', 'tool']",NCI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,UH3,2020,750000,-0.028474558735905955

"Georgia Clinical & Translational Science Alliance (GaCTSA) EFFECTIVE ALLOCATION OF TEST CENTERS FOR COVID-19 USING MACHINE LEARNING AND  ADAPTIVE SAMPLING ABSTRACT A critical task in managing and dealing with COVID-19 in communities is to perform diagnostic and/or antibody tests to identify diseased individuals. This information is critical to public health officials to estimate prevalence and transmission, and to effectively plan for required resources such as ICU beds, ventilators, personal protective equipment, and medical staff. Additionally, information on the number of infected people can be used to develop probabilistic and statistical models to estimate the reproduction number of the disease, and to predict the likely spatial and temporal trajectories of the outbreak. This provides vital information for planning actions and preparing policies and guidelines for social-distancing, school closures, remote work, community lockdown, etc. Despite the importance of diagnostic testing and identification of the positive cases, broad-scale testing is a challenging task particularly due to the limited number of test kits and resources. Our proposed research focuses on the development machine learning-based allocation strategies for determining the optimal location of COVID-19 test centers, including mobile and satellite centers, to minimize the local and global prediction uncertainties, maximize geographic coverage, associated with projections of spatio-temporal outbreak trajectories, and to improve efficient identification of diseased cases. EFFECTIVE ALLOCATION OF TEST CENTERS FOR COVID-19 USING MACHINE LEARNING AND  ADAPTIVE SAMPLING NARRATIVE Diagnostic and antibody tests for COVID-19 can provide invaluable information on prevalence and transmission of the disease. However, due to limited test capacity, broad-scale testing is currently not feasible. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a systematic and data-driven approach to defining testing strategies, in particular, determining the number and location of satellite and mobile testing centers (e.g., drive-through test locations). Our research program develops machine learning approaches to effectively allocate test centers for COVID-19 at the city, county, and state levels to accurately and reliably estimate the disease prevalence and its trajectory for resource planning and policy making, and to efficiently identify cases for treatment.",Georgia Clinical & Translational Science Alliance (GaCTSA),10158891,UL1TR002378,"['Active Learning', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Biology', 'COVID-19', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Ecology', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Federal Government', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Local Government', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Staff', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'Neurology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Social Distance', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Ventilator', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'case finding', 'disease transmission', 'environmental justice', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'metropolitan', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'transmission process']",NCATS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,UL1,2020,225579,-0.008963444066250624
"mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II 1 Project Summary NIH is increasing its investment in large, multi-center brain MRI studies via projects such as the recently announced BRAIN initiative. The success of these studies depends on the quality of MRIs and the resulting image measurements, regardless of sample size. Even though quality control of MRIs and corresponding measurements could be outsourced, most neuroscience studies rely on in-house procedures that combine automatically generated scores with manually guided checks, such as visual inspection. Implementing these procedures typically requires combining several software systems. For example, the NIH NIAAA- and BD2K- funded Data Analysis Resource (DAR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) uses XNAT to consolidate the structural, diffusion, and functional MRIs acquired across five sites, and has also developed their own custom software package to comply with study requirements for a multi-tier, quality control (QC) workflow. However, these custom, one-off tools lack support for the multi-site QC workflows that will come with the unified platform that MIQA represents: a design that supports collaboration and sharing, and strong cohesion between technologies. To improve the effectiveness of QC efforts specific to multi-center neuroimaging studies, we will develop a widely accessible and broadly compatible software platform that simplifies the creation of custom QC workflows in compliance with study requirements, provides core functionality for performing QC of medical images, and automatically generates documentation compliant with the FAIR principle, i.e., making scientific results findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  Specifically, our multi-site, web-based software platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by leveraging open-source, state-of-the-art web interface technologies, such as a web-based dataset caching system and machine learning to aid in QC processes. Users will be able to configure workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of medical imaging studies but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans. Issue tracking technology will enhance communication between geographically-distributed team members, as they can easily share image annotations and receive automated notifications of outstanding QC issues. The system will be easy to deploy as it will be able to interface with various imaging storage backends, such as local file systems and XNAT. While parts of this functionality have been developed elsewhere, MIQA is unique as it provides a unified, standard interface for efficient QC setup, maintenance, and review for projects analyzing multiple, independently managed data sources.  The usefulness of this unique QC system will be demonstrated on increasing the efficiency of the diverse QC team of the multi-center NCANDA study. Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop a web-based, multi-site, open-source platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) to address the QC needs of geographically diverse teams using small and large medical image-based studies alike. MIQA will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by levering state-of-the-art machine learning, data management, and web interface technologies. Our effort will minimize the time spent on labor-intensive reviews and analysis operations by supporting team-oriented reviewing that is guided by highly customizable workflows seamlessly interacting with existing data management systems.",mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II,10010814,R44MH119022,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Alcohols', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'FAIR principles', 'Four-dimensional', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Iowa', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'Writing', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dexterity', 'image archival system', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'open source', 'operation', 'quality assurance', 'research study', 'software systems', 'success', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'web interface']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R44,2020,819293,-0.005385598905289583

"High-Performance Compute Cluster for Comprehensive Cancer and Infectious Diseases Research Project Summary/Abstract Fred Hutch respectfully requests funds to upgrade the current 523-node, 3328-core high performance computing (HPC) cluster, which was created in 2004 and expanded in 2006, 2010 (S10 funds), 2013, 2015 (S10 funds), and 2018. 456 end of life nodes (1824 cores) will be replaced and 144 nodes (3456 cores) will be added, creating a new 211-node, 4996-core system with an overall 50% increase in core count, 60% increase in processing power, and more than 100% increase in memory capacity over the old system. The expanded capacity will enable deep and efficient analysis of our research studies and accommodate 20% annual growth in computing intensive research, much of which is not possible on the current cluster. The core user group for the new HPC cluster consists of at least 37 NIH-funded research groups participating in this proposal, however as much as 85 groups use the cluster regularly. Their biomedical research is aimed at eradicating cancer and other diseases and dependent on computationally intensive technical approaches such as development of novel statistical analysis or machine learning methods, for example for assessing immune correlates to facilitate vaccine development, analyzing large scale clinical trials or to develop software tools for the analysis of large-scale immunological datasets, DNA and RNA sequencing, modeling prostate cancer outcomes, studies of the human microbiome, modeling of cancers, mRNA, miRNA, and structural variant detection, structural biology with Cryo- EM, modeling of infectious agents and pandemics, computational modeling, prediction and design of macromolecular structures and interactions, identifying drivers of neoplasia and an international consortium improving colorectal cancer detection using GWAS, whole genome sequencing and genome-wide gene- environment (GxE) studies as well as research in diabetes, mhealth and cardiovascular diseases. Several of the Major Users at Fred Hutch are currently experiencing substantial delays in accomplishing their work using the current cluster. Others have projects that cannot be done at all on the existing instrument. (see Research Projects section for details). The Scientific Computing department (SciComp) has operated the current HPC cluster for more than 10 years and has a staff with a combined experience of over 150 years. The proposed new HPC cluster will be installed in available space in a Fred Hutch datacenter. The expanded cluster will address both immediate and future needs of our user community, supporting NIH-funded research at Fred Hutch. Funded research at our Center will greatly benefit from the increased data-processing capacity and improved performance of the requested HPC cluster, including applications of machine learning to the study of clinical trial efficacy, comparison of immune system receptors to identify responses to specific pathogens/diseases, modeling of carcinogenesis.

"Mobilize Center: Models for Mobile Sensing and Precision Rehabilitation Limited mobility due to conditions like osteoarthritis (OA), cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s disease affects millions of individuals, at enormous personal and societal cost. Rehabilitation can dramatically improve mobility and function, but current rehabilitation practice requires in-person guidance by a skilled clinician, increasing expense and limiting access. Mobile sensing technologies are now ubiquitous and have the potential to measure patient function and guide treatment outside the clinic, but they currently fail to capture the characteristics of motion required to accurately monitor function and customize treatment. Millions of low-cost mobile sensors are generating terabytes of data that could be analyzed in combination with other data, such as images, clinical records, and video, to enable studies of unprecedented scale, but machine learning models for analyzing these large-scale, heterogeneous, time-varying data are lacking.  To address these challenges, we will establish a Biomedical Technology Resource Center —The Mobilize Center. Through the leadership of an experienced scientific team, we will create and disseminate innovative tools to quantify movement biomechanics with mobile sensors.  Specifically, we will:  1. Push the bounds of what we can measure via wearable sensors using models that compute muscle  and joint forces and metabolic cost of locomotion. These models, based on biomechanical and machine  learning models, will be disseminated via our newly created OpenSense software, which will be used  by thousands of researchers to gain new insights into patient biomechanics using mobile sensors.  2. Meet the need for tools that analyze data about movement dynamics and develop machine learning  models to analyze and generate insights from unstructured, high-dimensional data, including time-  series (e.g., from mobile sensors), images (e.g., MRI), and video (e.g., smartphone video of a patient’s gait).  3. Provide tools needed to intervene in the real-world. We will develop algorithms to accurately quantify  kinematics outside the lab for long durations using data from inertial measurement units (IMUs). We will  also build behavioral models to adapt and personalize goal setting, drawing on movement records from  6 million individuals, as well as health goals and exercise for 1.7 million people.  Through intensive interactions with our Collaborative Projects, we will focus on improving rehabilitation outcomes for individuals with limited mobility due to osteoarthritis, obesity, Parkinson’s disease, and cerebral palsy. The Center’s tools and services will enable researchers to revolutionize how we diagnose, monitor, and treat mobility disorders, providing tools needed to deliver precision rehabilitation at low cost and on a massive scale in the future.

"Automated Object Contouring Methods & Software for Radiotherapy Planning Abstract In 2015, 1,658,370 new cancer cases are estimated to occur in the US, where nearly two-thirds will have radiation therapy (RT). Given that there are over 2,300 RT centers in the US, and current systems for contouring organs at risk (OARs) rely mostly on manual methods, there is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour OARs in medical images at a high degree of automation and for impacting current practice of RT planning. Encouraged by our strong Phase I results in thoracic and head and neck (H&N) body regions compared to current industry systems, we seek the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical acceptance of the contours output by our software product to significantly exceed those of existing systems. Our overall aim for Phase II is to advance the algorithms and prototype software developed in Phase I into a leading commercial software product, and demonstrate its efficacy in multiple medical centers across the country with diverse populations. Phase II specific aims are three-fold: (1) Further advance the automatic anatomy recognition algorithms from Phase I using advanced deep learning techniques. (2) Develop a cloud-based software auto contouring service. (3) Perform clinical evaluation of the new software on H&N and thoracic cases. Aim 1 will be accomplished in three stages: (a) Automating the process of defining the body region on given patient CT studies, which is currently done manually in our system, via a new concept of virtual landmarks using deep learning techniques. (b) Improving object recognition/ localization accuracy from the current 2 voxels for “good” quality data sets to 1 voxel and from 4-5 voxels for “poor” quality data sets to 2-3 voxels by using virtual landmarks to learn object relationships. (c) Improving object delineation by combining object localization methods with deep learning techniques applied to the vicinity of the localized objects to bring boundary distance accuracy within 1 voxel. Aim 2 will be achieved by developing a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service model to implement the software that incorporates the algorithms. To accomplish Aim 3, an evaluation study involving four academic RT centers will be undertaken to assess the efficiency, accuracy, and acceptability of the contours output by the new software. To assess efficiency, contouring time taken by the current clinical process will be compared to the time taken by the new software method plus any manual adjustment needed. Accuracy will be assessed by comparing software output to carefully prepared ground truth contours. Acceptability will be determined by conducting a blinded reader study, where an acceptability score (1-5) is given by radiation oncologists to software produced contours, ground truth contours, and contours produced by the normal clinical process, and comparing these scores. Expected clinical outcomes are significantly improved clinical efficiency/ acceptability of contouring compared to current practice. There is a strong commercial opportunity for producing a software system that can contour organs at risk in medical images at a high degree of automation for impacting current practice of radiation therapy planning.

"Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality Over the past 15 years, new imaging technologies and methods for high throughput imaging have revolutionized structural biology by extending the resolution and scale of collected images in 3 dimensions. The resulting image volumes are more typically hundreds of GB to even tens of TB and in some cases approach PB sizes. These file sizes pose challenges for image acquisition, image analysis, and communication of a representative set of raw data and quantification. Image acquisition runs can be lengthy and expensive, and often errors are not identified until after the completion of scanning. Large files contain many structures, and require machine learning (ML) strategies in a context that permits error correction. Scientific communication requires tools for ready access to raw data, and more efficient methods to communicate the rapidly accumulating sets of scientific information. We propose to leverage virtual reality (VR) and verbal communication within the VR environment, to streamline each of these stages of scientific work, by capitalizing on the more natural abilities for stereoscopic vision and hearing to process scenes and language. Based upon the tool base and direct volume rendering of large files that we have established in our VR software, called syGlass, we will first integrate VR into the microscope controls for tuning the microscope and then efficiently inspecting images in 3D as they are acquired (Aim 1). Next, we will introduce novel domain adaptation techniques in the ML field to scale up 3D image quantification capabilities for current acquisition sizes, by coupling them with user-optimized experiences that do not require ML expertise, and yet provide automated and accurate results (Aim 2). Finally, we will provide tools to efficiently generate narrated scientific presentations in VR for use in the lab setting, as manuscript publications, and for production of educational materials (Aim 3). In each of these activities, we will introduce paradigm shifts in the management of experiments, analysis of the resulting data, and publication of manuscripts and materials to other scientists and the general public. The goal of this project is to speed the pipeline from image acquisition to communication of analyzed data for large image files (big data). We propose to leverage virtual reality to change the way users interact with their microscope, provide new methods for more accurate quantification and make scientific data more transparent, and more accessible to specialists and the general public. These new paradigms are applicable to basic, pre-clinical and clinical research, and serve the goals of big data projects to generate more reliable and encompassing scientific conclusions.","Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality",10011054,R44MH125238,"['3-Dimensional', '3D virtual reality', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Depth Perception', 'Educational Materials', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Distribution', 'Ingestion', 'Instruction', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Lasers', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Resort', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'adaptation algorithm', 'base', 'data dissemination', 'data exploration', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feature detection', 'field study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'movie', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical research', 'scale up', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment']",NIMH,ISTOVISR,R44,2020,1159612,-0.027710205591375152
"Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of neurological disorders and affects over 2.5 million people each year, yet no treatment has successfully translated from bench to clinic. TBI is a broad term and encompasses an extremely heterogeneous set of injuries differing by cause, severity, biomechanics, and the varied, complex secondary injury responses that collectively result in chronic disabilities. Current preclinical research circumvents the issue of TBI heterogeneity by relying on specific preclinical animal models that mimic subpopulations of patients and particular secondary injury mechanisms with each study focusing on limited, individual pathways. This proposal instead aims to tackle TBI heterogeneity by approaching TBI as a “big data” problem and aggregating and analyzing the multidimensional data collectively. A framework for data harmonization and curation will be developed, and datasets from a consortium of preclinical labs employing a variety of preclinical TBI models will be collected and curated into an open data commons (ODC-TBI). Utilizing machine learning and multidimensional analytics, the proposed research will directly leverage TBI heterogeneity in the merged dataset to identify persistent features of TBI to empower translational research. By creating a preclinical TBI ODC and applying machine learning to integrate the heterogeneity of preclinical TBI models, the project will reveal multidimensional features of TBI across heterogeneous injuries and characterize how diverse secondary injury mechanisms interact and ultimately affect injury outcome. Throughout the project's timeline, new datasets will continue to be harmonized into the ODC-TBI according to the established framework. The ODC-TBI will be the first open multicenter, multi-model repository of preclinical TBI data and will enable the application of data science to the field of TBI. Furthermore, the ODC-TBI and the methods implemented throughout the project will be openly shared to improve reproducibility of TBI research. Together with the multidimensional analysis that will provide quantitative and qualitative understanding of TBI heterogeneity, the project aims to ultimately accelerate data- driven discovery and precision medicine for TBI. Reflecting the complexities of clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI), preclinical TBI research is confounded by the extreme heterogeneity prevalent across possible injury models and resulting biological responses. The proposed research will aggregate and curate an extensive open data commons (ODC) of preclinical TBI research with multiple TBI models and utilize machine learning to tackle TBI heterogeneity directly. The project will create an ODC for preclinical TBI research to improve data sharing and scientific reproducibility, and will empower translational TBI research by identifying multidimensional features of TBI that best predict functional outcome.",Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility,10042756,F32NS117728,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Closed head injuries', 'Common Data Element', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'behavioral outcome', 'bench to bedside', 'biomarker discovery', 'controlled cortical impact', 'data curation', 'data framework', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple datasets', 'nerve injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'open data', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'precision medicine', 'repository', 'response', 'response to injury']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,69810,-0.021242136534944406
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"5/6 COMpAAAS U24: Resource in Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) The overall aim of the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/Aids, Alcohol, Aging, & multi- Substance use (COMpAAAS) is to build and disseminate the evidence needed to optimize care for HIV+ experiencing medical harm from alcohol and related substance use, through coordinated, integrated, and externally validated observational, operations research modeling, and intervention studies. Combining and integrating the complimentary expertise of informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, we propose a U24 Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) to support and inform the other COMpAAAS components. This resource will address the complex challenges required to maximize power and minimize bias in analyses addressing consortium-wide questions. Advanced informatics methods supported include natural language processing (NLP), ontologies, database and clinical decision support, and application of vital data management tools for secure data collection, storage, annotation, retrieval, and integration. Advanced epidemiological and statistical methods include time-updated exposure techniques, multiple imputation, propensity score techniques, measurement error correction, and competing risks regression. Routine, but essential, statistical methods include Cox proportional hazards, logistic and linear regression, goodness of fit diagnostics, and agreement/accuracy metrics (kappa, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). The RIB will further leverage the observational and interventional studies, simulation models, and well-coordinated network of cores and workgroups of COMpAAAS with advanced informatics and biostatistical techniques tailored to the particular challenges of large scale, longitudinal data from multiple sources including electronic health records (EHR), clinical interventions, patient self-report, and tissue repositories. Our specific aims are to provide 1) statistical and 2) informatics expertise for COMpAAAS to maximize scientific impact. To accomplish this, we will enhance the design, recruitment, and follow-up of intervention studies, support appropriate design and execution of data analyses and cross cohort collaborations, provide advanced statistical methods plus estimates of alcohol patterns for OR modeling and identify sexual/gender minority populations (CHAMP) from VACS survey data. In addition we will enhance the Consortium Web-Based Laboratory (WBL Portal) informatics infrastructure to support ongoing research design, data collection and management, development and testing of interventions such as clinical decision support and eHealth tools and enhance support for the analysis of textual data. The Resource for Informatics and Biostatistics (RIB) will extend and enhance the research capacities and productivity among investigators at the NIAAA-funded Consortium to improve OutcoMes in hiv/AIDS, Alcohol, Aging, and multi-Substance use (COMpAAAS).

"Designing neutralization antibodies against Sars-Cov-2 Project Summary COVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic whose rapid spread and mortality rate threatens millions of lives and the global economic system. Developing effective treatment such as neutralization antibodies is an urgent need. We propose here to develop a new method to design antibodies strongly bind to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) that is necessary for viral entrance to human cells. We will develop a novel approach that combines directed evolution, deep sequencing and interpretable neural network models to efficiently identify strong and specific antibodies. This method will allow analyzing large sequencing data sets of antibody variants against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in order to derive superior binders that do not exist in the original library. Iteration through directed evolution and computational design will efficiently identify neutralization antibody candidates that can be used as potent therapeutics to treat COVID-19.

"Highly Portable and Cloud-Enabled Neuroimaging Research: Confronting Ethics Challenges in Field Research with New Populations Project Summary / Abstract  This 4-year Neuroethics R01 based at the University of Minnesota (UMN) will convene a national Working Group of top neuroethics, neurolaw, and neuroscience experts to conduct empirical research and generate evidence-based consensus recommendations for the ethical conduct of population research using highly portable, cloud-enabled MRI in new and diverse populations in field settings. NIH is supporting the development of both high-field portable MRI (3U01EB025153-02S2, PI: Garwood), and ultra- low field MRI (P41EB015896, PI: Rosen). As portable MRI develops quickly, guidance is urgently needed on unresolved ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI). This R01 project builds on two NIH Administrative Supplements that have preliminarily identified the most pressing unresolved ELSI issues: (1) informed consent; (2) data security and privacy; (3) establishing local capacity to interpret and communicate neuroimaging data; (4) extensive reliance on cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) for data analysis; (5) potential bias of interpretive algorithms in diverse populations; (6) return of research results and incidental (or secondary) findings to research participants; and (7) responding to participant requests for access to their data.  Building on this preliminary work, Aim 1 will utilize survey research to inform a systematic Working Group (WG) process described in Aim 2. In Aim 1a, we will survey the U.S. general public, including over- sampling of rural, older adult, non-Hispanic African American, Hispanic/Latino, and economically disadvantaged respondents, to probe likely research use cases, issues they raise, potential solutions, and willingness to participate in research. In Aim 1b, we will survey expert stakeholders to elicit views on current/future research use cases and how to address the ELSI challenges. Expert stakeholders will be from 5 key groups: (1) researchers utilizing brain MRI and scientists developing new MRI technology; (2) neuroethics and legal scholars; (3) industry stakeholders; (4) leaders in regulatory agencies and standard-setting organizations; and (5) leaders in patient advocacy organizations. Aim 2 builds on Aim 1 to generate evidence-based consensus guidance on the ethical conduct of research in the field using highly portable, cloud-enabled neuroimaging. In Aim 2a, we will use a modified Delphi method to elicit initial WG views on issue priorities, research use cases, and potential recommendations, and will develop an Annotated Bibliography. In Aim 2b, the WG will pursue a structured process of analysis and consensus building that is well-established in bioethics and law, in order to identify best practices and formulate recommendations informed by the Aim 1 work. In Aim 2c, we will solicit feedback on our recommendations from expert readers and through a major public conference. Project products will include: an online Annotated Bibliography, WG consensus recommendations, individual targeted articles, published empirical analyses, a webcast public conference, a symposium issue of a peer-reviewed journal, online access to our work, and wide dissemination. Project Narrative This innovative 4-year project based at the University of Minnesota will convene a national Working Group of top neuroethics, neurolaw, and neuroscience experts to conduct empirical research and generate evidence- based consensus recommendations for the ethical conduct of research using highly portable, cloud-enabled MRI in new and diverse populations in field settings. Highly-portable MRI, a transformative technology supported by the NIH BRAIN Initiative, will allow researchers to conduct population-based neuroscience research, including racial and ethnic minorities, rural, and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations that are currently underrepresented in neuroimaging research, and will accelerate research on brain biomarkers for neurodegeneration. The project team will address fundamental challenges in field-based neuroimaging research such as informed consent, data privacy, and return of results; produce Working Group consensus recommendations and targeted individual articles; publish empirical analyses; create a symposium issue of a peer-reviewed journal presenting project publications; create a publicly accessible Annotated Bibliography; produce a webcast and videotaped public conference; build an online portal offering access to our work; and conduct wide dissemination.",Highly Portable and Cloud-Enabled Neuroimaging Research: Confronting Ethics Challenges in Field Research with New Populations,10035136,RF1MH123698,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bibliography', 'Bioethics', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Consultations', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Security', 'Development', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Elderly', 'Empirical Research', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Group Processes', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informed Consent', 'International', 'Interview', 'Journals', 'Latino', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Participant', 'Patient Representative', 'Patient advocacy', 'Peer Review', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Research', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Respondent', 'Review Literature', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'advocacy organizations', 'base', 'cloud based', 'data privacy', 'demographics', 'disadvantaged population', 'ethical legal social implication', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'neuroethics', 'neuroimaging', 'population based', 'portability', 'racial minority', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'symposium', 'web portal', 'willingness', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,RF1,2020,25577,-0.023526660357515567
"Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award.

"What comes next? Engaging stakeholders in governance of participant data and relationships during the sunset of large genomic medicine research initiatives Abstract The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) has increased access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation’s leading clinicians and scientists. Phase II of the Network will facilitate the transition of UDN efforts toward sustainability, through the expansion of clinical sites, refinement of methods, and integration with regular clinical practice. Here, we propose a program of study that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) improve diagnostic rates through novel approaches to data analysis and integration; and (3) explore underlying mechanisms of disease to accelerate therapeutic drug discovery. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate patients referred to the UDN through a protocol that includes pre-visit chart review and genetic counseling followed by an individualized visit during which standardized phenotypic and environmental data are collected. Biosamples facilitate genomic, multi-omic, and cellular evaluation of disease. Expansion of fibroblasts and, in selected cases, generation of induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines facilitates scientific investigation of the underlying diseases. We will expand our program of patient outreach, particularly to under-served populations. We will extend our UDN-based genomic medicine educational program both in scope and by broadening its eligibility. In Aim 2, we propose to develop and implement novel methods in areas of high potential to increase diagnostic yield. This includes algorithms for the detection of small genomic insertions and deletions as well as large scale structural variation. We will develop alignment algorithms using graph reference genomes and promote the use of long-read sequencing technologies. We will apply machine learning to the systematic integration of RNA sequencing, metabolomic, and phenotypic data with the electronic medical record and the entire medical literature to improve diagnostic yield. In Aim 3, we propose to facilitate diagnosis through enhanced cellular and model organisms phenotyping. We will implement immunomic and metagenomic approaches such as T cell, B cell and unknown organism sequencing for undiagnosed cases. We will utilize methods for moderate- and high-throughput phenotyping of iPS-derived cells and promote novel drug discovery via high throughput drug screening both with FDA- approved drugs and large scale small molecule libraries. Beyond Phase II, Stanford Medicine has made a strong commitment to the continuation of the Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford through a multi- million dollar institutional commitment. In summary, we aim to build on the success of Phase I of the UDN by streamlining processes, maximizing collaboration and outreach, optimizing computational algorithms, extending scientific investigation towards therapeutic discovery, and promoting engagement of hospital leaders, clinicians, scientists, policy-makers, and philanthropists to ensure this national resource is sustained long beyond the duration of this award.

"Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK Abstract Thousands of medical researchers around the world use VTK —the Visualization Toolkit— an open-source, freely available software development toolkit providing advanced 3D interactive visualization, image processing and data analysis algorithms. They either use VTK directly in their in-house research applications or indirectly via one of the multitude of medical image analysis and bioinformatics applications that is built using VTK: Osirix, 3D Slicer, BioImageXD, MedINRIA, SCIRun, ParaView, and others. Furthermore, VTK also provides 3D visualizations for clinical applications such as BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system and Zimmer’s prosthesis design and evaluation platform. VTK has been downloaded many hundreds of thousands of times since its initial release in 1993. Considering its broad distribution and prevalent use, it can be argued that VTK has had a greater impact on medical research, and patient care, than any other open-source visualization package.  This proposal is in response to the multitude of requests we have been receiving from the VTK medical community. The aims are as follows:  1. Aim 1: Adaptive visualization framework: Produce an integrated framework that supports  visualization applications that balance server-side and client-side processing depending on data size,  analysis requirements, and the user platform (e.g., phone, tablet, or GPU-enabled desktop).  2. Aim 2: Integrated, interactive applications: Extend VTK to support a diversity of programming  paradigms ranging from C++ to JavaScript to Python and associated tools such as Jupyter Notebooks,  integrating with emerging technologies such as deep learning technologies.  3. Aim 3: Advanced rendering, including AR/VR: Target shader-based rendering systems and AR/VR  libraries that achieve high frame rates with minimal latency for ubiquitous applications that combine  low-cost, portable devices such as phones, ultrasound transducers, and other biometric sensors for  visually monitoring, guiding, and delivering advanced healthcare.  4. Aim 4: Infrastructure, Outreach, and Validation: Engage the VTK community and the proposed  External Advisory Board during the creation and assessment of the proposed work and corresponding  modern, digital documentation in the form of videos and interactive web-based content. Project Narrative The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software library for the interactive display and processing of medical images. It is being used in most major medical imaging research applications, e.g., 3D Slicer and Osirix, and in several commercial medical applications, e.g., BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system. VTK development began in 1993 and since then an extensive community of users and developers has grown around it. However, the rapid advancement of cloud computing, GPU hardware, deep learning algorithms, and VR/AR systems require corresponding advances in VTK so that the research and products that depend on VTK continue to deliver leading edge healthcare technologies. With the proposed updates, not only will existing applications continue to provide advanced healthcare, but new, innovative medical applications will also be inspired.",Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK,9910382,R01EB014955,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biometry', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Publications', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virtual and Augmented reality', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cloud based', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'digital', 'health care delivery', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'open source', 'outreach', 'point of care', 'portability', 'processing speed', 'real world application', 'response', 'sensor', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'synergism', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'trend', 'web services']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R01,2020,510157,-0.00541692485354833
"Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing Millions of Americans receive evidence-based counseling for substance use problems each year. Many  evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are “talk based” therapies, such as motivational  interviewing (MI), but the existing research-based methodology for evaluating counseling quality is  to record sessions and use human rating teams to evaluate them. However, using humans as the  assessment tool via behavioral coding is prohibitive in cost and time, can be error prone, and is  virtually never used in the real world. Technology is needed that can analyze the speech patterns and spoken language of counseling  sessions, provide automatic and intuitive quality scores, and summarize these in actionable  feedback. Rapid, performance-based quality metrics could support training, ongoing supervision, and  quality assurance for millions of evidence-based counseling sessions for substance abuse each year. Lyssn.io is a start-up targeting the development of implementation-focused technology to support  evidence-based counseling.  Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are  objective, scalable, and cost efficient. Lyssn.io includes expertise in speech signal processing,  machine learning, user-centered design, software engineering, and clinical expertise in evidence-based counseling.  Previous NIH-funded research laid a computational foundation for generating MI quality metrics from  speech and language features in MI sessions, and led to a prototype of a clinical software support  tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The current Fast-Track SBIR proposal includes Phase I, which will focus on understanding clinical  workflows, assessing usability, and initial validation of machine learning of MI fidelity measures  in the opioid treatment program at Evergreen Treatment Services (ETS) clinic in Seattle, WA. Phase  II will focus on robust validation of the speech and language technologies underlying the CORE-MI  tool, and development of scalable supervision protocols that integrate CORE-MI supported feedback  for counselors. Finally, we will conduct a quasi-experimental evaluation of CORE-MI supported  supervision and training at a second ETS clinic in the Puget Sound, focusing on acceptability,  usability, and adoption, the impact on supervision, improved MI fidelity and preliminary evidence  of increased client retention.  The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on  human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the  capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance in MI for substance abuse. Most evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are in-person psychotherapy and counseling  interventions, such as motivational interviewing. There are currently no methods for evaluating the  quality of such counseling interventions in the real world to support training, supervision, and  quality assurance. Building on an existing prototype, Lyssn.io – a technology start-up focused on  scalable and cost-efficient human-centered technologies – will enhance and evaluate a cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant clinical support software tool that uses automated speech recognition and machine learning in an community  based opioid replacement clinic.","Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing",9930480,R44DA046243,"['Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychotherapy', 'Research', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Transcript', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'opioid treatment program', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support tools', 'technology validation', 'tool development', 'treatment services', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual']",NIDA,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R44,2020,134649,-0.10495593693816058

"Graphical Processing Units and a Large-Memory Compute Node for Applications in Genomics, Neuroscience, and Structural Biology Project Summary  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) is a private, not-for-profit institution dedicated to research and education in biology, with leading research programs in genomics, neuroscience, quantitative biology, plant biology, and cancer. Many activities at CSHL depend critically on high-performance computing resources, but at present, investigators have limited access to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and large-memory compute nodes. This deficiency is beginning to hamper a wide variety of biomedical research activities, particularly in the key areas of genomics, neuroscience and structural biology, where such specialty hardware is becoming essential for many important computational analyses. Here, we propose to acquire four state-of-the-art GPU nodes, each equipped with eight Nvidia Tesla V100, SXM2, 32GB GPUs, two 20-core 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon-Gold 6248 (Cascade Lake) processors, and 768 GB of RAM. A second-generation Nvidia NVLink will provide for 300 GB/s inter-GPU communication. In addition, we propose to acquire one large-memory node with 3 TB of RAM and four 20-core 2.5 GHz Intel Xeon-Gold 6248 (Cascade Lake) processors, as well as a top-of-rack 10 Gb Ethernet switch to interconnect the servers with each other and with our existing computer cluster. These new resources will enable a wide variety of innovative research across fields, with direct implications for human health. In genomics, applications will include RNA-seq read mapping; alignment, base-calling, and genome assembly for long-read sequence data; clustering of single cell RNA-seq data; analysis of transposable elements; deep-learning methods for prediction of the fitness consequences of mutations; and deep-learning methods for interpreting high-throughput mutagenesis experiments. In neuroscience, they will include analysis of multi-neuron activity recordings; analysis of mouse brain images; and artificial neural network models of the human olfactory system, of audio features, and of behavior as a function of changing motivations. In structural biology, they will include image processing and 3D reconstruction from cryo-electron microscopy data. These new compute nodes will have a primary impact on the research programs of nine major users from the CSHL faculty with substantial NIH funding. They will also impact three minor users. The new GPU and large-memory nodes will be fully integrated with a soon-to-be-upgraded high-performance computer cluster and managed by the experienced Information Technology group at CSHL, with oversight from a committee of seven faculty members and two IT staff members. Altogether, these new computational resources will substantially enhance the overall computational infrastructure at CSHL. Project Narrative  Many areas of modern biomedical research depend critically on state-of-the-art computing resources. Here we propose to acquire two types of specialty computer hardware: four Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) nodes and a large-memory compute node, both of which will be fully integrated with an existing and soon-to-be-upgraded high-performance computer cluster.

"Developing novel technologies that ensure privacy and security in biomedical data science research Data science holds the promise of enabling new pathways to discovery and can improve the understanding, prevention and treatment of complex disorders such as cancer, diabetes, substance abuse, etc., which are significantly on the rise. The promise of data science can be fully realized only when collected data can be collaboratively shared and analyzed. However, the widespread increases in healthcare data breaches due to inappropriate access as well as the increasing number of novel privacy attacks restrict institutions from sharing data. Indeed, in some cases, the results of the analysis can themselves lead to significant privacy harm. The success of the data commons depends on ensuring the maximal access to data, subject to all of the patient privacy requirements including those mandated by legislation, and all of the constraints of the organization collecting the data itself. While there are existing solutions that can solve parts of the problem, there are significant challenges in truly incorporating these into comprehensive working solutions that are usable by the biomedical research community, and new challenges brought on by modern techniques such as deep learning. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that can holistically enable data sharing while respecting privacy and security considerations and to ensure that they are implemented in existing platforms that have widespread acceptance in the research community. Towards this, the objective of this project is to develop complementary solutions for risk inference, distributed learning, and access control that can enable different modalities of data sharing. The problems studied are general in nature and will evolve depending on research successes and new impediments that arise. The proposed program of research is significant since lack of access to biomedical data can lead to fragmentation of care, resulting in higher economic and social costs, and is a significant impediment to biomedical research. The project will result in open-source, freely available software tools that will be integrated into widely used data collection, cohort identification, and distributed analytics platforms. There are several ongoing collaborations that will serve as initial pilot customers to provide use cases, identify the requirements, evaluate results, and in general validate the developed solutions. Project Narrative Statement of Relevance to Public Health Being able to ensure privacy and security while enabling data sharing and analysis is critical to pave the way forward for public health research and improve our understanding of diseases. The proposed work will address the challenges that impede the use of data across all of the different modalities of data sharing.

"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data.

"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches.

"Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing Millions of Americans receive evidence-based counseling for substance use problems each year. Many evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are “talk based” therapies, such as motivational interviewing (MI), but the existing research-based methodology for evaluating counseling quality is to record sessions and use human rating teams to evaluate them. However, using humans as the assessment tool via behavioral coding is prohibitive in cost and time, can be error prone, and is virtually never used in the real world. Technology is needed that can analyze the speech patterns and spoken language of counseling sessions, provide automatic and intuitive quality scores, and summarize these in actionable feedback. Rapid, performance-based quality metrics could support training, ongoing supervision, and quality assurance for millions of evidence-based counseling sessions for substance abuse each year. Lyssn.io is a start-up targeting the development of implementation-focused technology to support evidence-based counseling. Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient. Lyssn.io includes expertise in speech signal processing, machine learning, user-centered design, software engineering, and clinical expertise in evidence-based counseling. Previous NIH-funded research laid a computational foundation for generating MI quality metrics from speech and language features in MI sessions, and led to a prototype of a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The current Fast-Track SBIR proposal includes Phase I, which will focus on understanding clinical workflows, assessing usability, and initial validation of machine learning of MI fidelity measures in the opioid treatment program at Evergreen Treatment Services (ETS) clinic in Seattle, WA. Phase II will focus on robust validation of the speech and language technologies underlying the CORE-MI tool, and development of scalable supervision protocols that integrate CORE-MI supported feedback for counselors. Finally, we will conduct a quasi-experimental evaluation of CORE-MI supported supervision and training at a second ETS clinic in the Puget Sound, focusing on acceptability, usability, and adoption, the impact on supervision, improved MI fidelity and preliminary evidence of increased client retention. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance in MI for substance abuse. Most evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are in-person psychotherapy and counseling interventions, such as motivational interviewing. There are currently no methods for evaluating the quality of such counseling interventions in the real world to support training, supervision, and quality assurance. Building on an existing prototype, Lyssn.io – a technology start-up focused on scalable and cost-efficient human-centered technologies – will enhance and evaluate a cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant clinical support software tool that uses automated speech recognition and machine learning in an community based opioid replacement clinic.","Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing",9847959,R44DA046243,"['Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Counseling', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'automated speech recognition', 'automobile accident', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'dashboard', 'design', 'encryption', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'gun homicide', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid treatment program', 'overdose death', 'prediction algorithm', 'protocol development', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'research and development', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'sound', 'speech processing', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment services', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual', 'visual feedback']",NIDA,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R44,2020,394059,-0.10495593693816058
"N3C & All of Us Research Program Collaborative Project Project Summary/Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented clinical and public health challenges. Though institutions collect large amounts of clinical data about COVID-19 cases, these datasets individually might not be diverse enough to draw population level conclusions. Also, statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. To tackle this problem, NCATS introduced the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science, community-based initiative to share patient level data for analysis. The initiative requires participating institutions to share information about their COVID-19 patients in a standard-driven way, including demographics, vital signs, diagnoses, laboratory results, medications, and other treatments. The data from multiple institutions will be merged and consolidated, and access will be provided to investigators through a centralized analytical platform. The COVID-19 data sharing collaboration with the N3C initiative offers a mechanism to initiate collaborations with other NIH sponsored data sharing programs, such as the All of Us Research Program (AoURP). This administrative supplement will support efforts to clean and standardize data at VCU, and to transfer it to the N3C data repository. The supplement will also assist in introducing new services at the Wright Center to support our investigators to use the N3C resources. It will also enable collaboration with the AoURP by establishing a pipeline to collect and transmit consented patients' EHR data and by building on existing community outreach pathways to recruit additional participants for the AoURP. The project will be overseen by the PI/Executive Committee and supervised by the Director of Research Informatics. Procedures and services developed at our local CTSA hub will be shared and disseminated to the CTSA network. Project Narrative NIH/NCATS has been working on the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), which aims to build a centralized national data resource to be used by the research community to study the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential treatments as the pandemic continues to evolve. The COVID-19 data sharing collaboration with the N3C initiative also offers a mechanism to initiate collaborations with the All of Us Research Program (AoURP).

"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,10002324,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'complex data ', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'feature extraction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2020,869698,-0.01525588062826465
"Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity PROJECT SUMMARY Reliable and real-time municipality-level predictive modeling and forecasts of infectious disease activity have the potential to transform the way public health decision-makers design interventions such as information campaigns, preemptive/reactive vaccinations, and vector control, in the presence of health threats across the world. While the links between disease activity and factors such as: human mobility, climate and environmental factors, socio-economic determinants, and social media activity have long been known in the epidemic literature, few efforts have focused on the evident need of developing an open-source platform capable of leveraging multiple data sources, factors, and disparate modeling methodologies, across a large and heterogeneous nation to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over four geographic scales (nation, state, city, and municipal). The overall goal of this project is to develop such a platform. Our long-term goal is to investigate effective ways to incorporate the findings from multiple disparate studies on disease dynamics around the globe with local and global factors such as weather conditions, socio- economic status, satellite imagery and online human behavior, to develop an operational, robust, and real- time data-driven disease forecasting platform. The objective of this grant is to leverage the expertise of three complementary scientific research teams and a wealth of information from a diverse array of data sources to build a modeling platform capable of combining information to produce real-time short term disease forecasts at the local level. As part of this, we will evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales--nation, state, city, and municipality--using Brazil as a test case. Additionally, we will use machine learning and mechanistic models to understand disease dynamics at multiple spatial scales, across a heterogeneous country such as Brazil. Our specific aims will (1) Assess the utility of individual data streams and modeling techniques for disease forecasting; (2) Fuse modeling techniques and data streams to improve accuracy and robustness at the four spatial scales; (3) Characterize the basic computational infrastructure necessary to build an operational disease forecasting platform; and (4) Validate our approach in a real-world setting. This contribution is significant because It will advance our scientific knowledge on the accuracy and limitations of disparate data streams and multiple modeling approaches when used to forecast disease transmission. Our efforts will help produce operational and systematic disease forecasts at a local level (city- and municipality-level). Moreover, we aim at building a new open-source computational platform for the epidemiological community to use as a knowledge discovery tool. Finally, we aim at developing this platform under the guidance of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel comprising of WHO, CDC, academics, and local and federal stakeholders within Brazil. The proposed approach is innovative because few efforts have focused on developing an open-source computational platform capable of combining disparate data sources and drivers, across a heterogeneous and large nation, into multiple modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease transmission, over multiple geographic scales.. In addition, we propose to investigate how to best combine modeling approaches that have, to this date, been developed and interpreted independently, namely, traditional epidemiological mechanistic models and novel machine-learning predictive models, in order to produce accurate and robust real-time disease activity estimates and forecasts. Project Narrative The proposed research is of crucial importance to public health surveillance and preparedness communities because it seeks to identify effective ways to utilize previously disconnected results, that have pointed out links between disease spread and factors such as socio-economic status, local weather conditions, human mobility, social media activity, to build an open-source and data driven, modeling platform capable of extracting and disseminating information from disparate data sources, and complementary modeling approaches, to (1) Evaluate the predictive power of disparate data streams and modeling approaches to monitor and forecast disease at multiple geographic scales: nation, state, city, and municipality; (2) Fuse complementary modeling approaches that have been developed independently and oftentimes not used in conjunction; (3) produce real- time and short term forecasts of disease activity in multiple geographic scales across a heterogeneous and large nation like Brazil.",Development of an Open-Source and Data-Driven Modeling Platform to Monitor and Forecast Disease Activity,10000112,R01GM130668,"['Area', 'Assimilations', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Brazil', 'Burn injury', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dengue', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Population Surveillance', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'ZIKA', 'base', 'chikungunya', 'climate variability', 'computational platform', 'computer infrastructure', 'data infrastructure', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'economic determinant', 'experience', 'flu', 'genomic data', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'spreading factor', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'vector control', 'vector-borne']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,365601,-0.00444382478657683
"Intelligent deployment of containerized bioinformatics workflows on the cloud PROJECT SUMMARY Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges of big data. Public cloud vendors provide computing as-a-utility enabling users to pay only for the resources that are actually used. In this application, we will develop methods and tools to enable biomedical researchers to optimize the costs of cloud computing when analyzing biomedical big data. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud provides computing as a utility, on-demand, to end users, enabling cloud resources to be rapidly provisioned and scaled to meet computational and performance requirements. In addition, dynamic intelligent allocation of cloud computing resources has great potential to both improve performance and reduce hosting costs. Unfortunately, determining the most cost-effective and efficient ways to deploy modules on the cloud is non- trivial, due to a plethora of cloud vendors, each providing different types of virtual machines with different capabilities, performance trade-offs, and pricing structures. In addition, modern bioinformatics workflows consist of multiple modules, applications and libraries, each with their own set of software dependencies. Software containers package binary executables and scripts into modules with their software dependencies. With containers that compartmentalize software dependencies, modules implemented as containers can be mixed and matched to create workflows that give identical results on any platform. The high degree of reproducibility and flexibility of software containers makes them ideal instruments for disseminating complex bioinformatics workflows. Our overarching goal is to deliver the latest technological advances in containers and cloud computing to a typical biomedical researcher with limited resources who works with big data. Specifically, we will develop a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface to enable biomedical researchers to build and edit containerized workflows. Most importantly, users can choose to deploy and scale selected modules in the workflow on cloud computing platforms in a transparent, yet guided fashion, to optimize cost and performance. Our aim is to provide a federated approach that leverages resources from multiple cloud vendors. We have assembled a team of interdisciplinary scientists with expertise in bioinformatics, cloud and distributed computing, and machine learning. As part of this application, we will work closely with end users who routinely generate and analyze RNA-seq data. We will illustrate how our containerized, cloud-enabled methods and tools will benefit bioinformatics analyses. Project Narrative Cloud computing has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenge of analyzing diverse and massive data generated to advance our understanding of health and diseases. We will develop methods and tools to build and intelligently deploy modular and cloud-enabled bioinformatics workflows. These tools will allow the biomedical community to optimize the costs associated with cloud computing and to facilitate the replication of scientific results.",Intelligent deployment of containerized bioinformatics workflows on the cloud,9856493,R01GM126019,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Case Study', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Drops', 'Drug toxicity', 'Educational Materials', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Price', 'Privatization', 'RNA analysis', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomedical scientist', 'cloud platform', 'cluster computing', 'computational platform', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'distributed data', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrument', 'outreach', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'virtual machine', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,339098,-0.036578280655007435
"Opera Phenix High-Content Imaging System for Drug Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY The University of Pittsburgh Drug Discovery Institute (UPDDI) is requesting funds to purchase the Perkin Elmer OPERA PHENIX high speed, high resolution spinning disk confocal High-Content Screening (HCS) device. The Opera Phenix will replace two Molecular Devices ImageXpress Ultra high content readers purchased in 2008, which are critical to multiple NIH-, DoD-, and Foundation-funded projects at the University of Pittsburgh, but are no longer supported by the manufacturer and have been decommissioned. We have determined that one Opera Phenix instrument can replace the two IXUs. The Phenix is a third generation HCS instrument that will be essential to satisfy the diverse needs of users that the UPDDI serves. No comparable instruments exist at the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and Carnegie Mellon University. Over the last decade, HCS has become a standard in the pharmaceutical industry for target identification, phenotypic screening, as well as toxicology, and in academia for large-scale biological studies, where cell-by- cell quantitation is critical. The UPDDI has been an academic pioneer in the application of HCS and serves an extensive number of collaborators across campus that require and rely on HCS, ranging from neurodegeneration, organ regeneration, cancer, liver diseases, organotypic model development, and traumatic brain injury. Our diverse user groups’ needs emphasize discovery models of physiological relevance and high complexity, and therefore require fast, high resolution 2D, 3D, and kinetic imaging and maximum flexibility in image analysis. The large number of HCS users working in the UPDDI further demands a fast system to permit effective sharing of instrument time, and an integrated database with off-site user access to perform off- line analysis. Key requirements for an HCS imager therefore are superior speed in acquiring z-series of images at high resolution of thick specimens in aqueous matrices, mature yet flexible image algorithms, and seamless integration of instrument software with system, public,and custom-developed UPDDI databases. The only instrument that meets all of these criteria is the Opera Phenix because it has 1) fast laser-based illumination and the ability to acquire multiple channels simultaneously 2) water immersion objectives that eliminate non-matching refractive indices, which limit spherical aberrations of air and oil objectives at longer working distances and require adjustment of correction collars depending on imaging depth; 3) a powerful suite of user-friendly yet flexible image analysis routines including a 3D module, advanced texture and morphology analysis, and intuitive and user-friendly machine learning; and 4) the ability to perform seamless “adaptive high-resolution imaging”, i.e., pre-scanning a large area at low magnification, followed by automated “on-the- fly” switching to higher magnification to acquire high resolution images of user-defined regions of interest. The Opera Phenix is the only instrument on the market that is capable of fulfilling the demands of the University of Pittsburgh’s diverse drug discovery community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Modern drug discovery increasingly demands better and more disease relevant models and the ability to analyze them. High-content screening (HCS) has become indispensable in the analysis of such models as it permits the analysis of cells, their constituents, and interactions in their proper biological context. The third generation HCS instrument, Opera Phenix, produces the quality and quantity of data from cells, tissues and experimental animals that are required for computational and systems biological investigations, while at the same time providing the throughput needed for automated screening.",Opera Phenix High-Content Imaging System for Drug Discovery,9935240,S10OD028450,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academia', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Drug Industry', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immersion', 'Institutes', 'Intuition', 'Kinetics', 'Lasers', 'Lighting', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical center', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oils', 'Phenotype', 'Reader', 'Refractive Indices', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Texture', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Water', 'aqueous', 'base', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'organ regeneration', 'physiologic model', 'screening', 'user-friendly']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,S10,2020,1010594,-0.019308957554403375
"A Data Science Framework for Empirically Evaluating and Deriving Reproducible and Transferrable RDoC Constructs in Youth This project provides a data science framework and a toolbox of best practices for systematic and reproducible data-driven methods for validating and deriving RDoC constructs with relevance to psychopathology. Despite recent advances in methods for data-driven constructs, results are often hard to reproduce using samples from other studies. There is a lack of systematic statistical methods and analytical design for enhancing reproducibility. To fill this gap, we will develop a data science framework, including novel scalable algorithms and software, to derive and validate RDoC constructs. Although the proposed methods will generally apply to all RDoC domains and constructs, we focus specifically on furthering understanding of the RDoC domains of cognitive control (CC) and attention (ATT) constructs implicated in attention deficit disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Our application will use multi-modal neuroimaging, behavioral, and clinical/self-report data from large, nationally representative samples from the on Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and multiple local clinical samples with ADHD and OCD. Specifically, using the baseline ABCD samples, in aim 1, we will apply and develop methods to assess and validate the current configuration of RDoC for CC and ATT using confirmatory latent variable modeling. We will implement and develop new unsupervised learning methods to construct new computational-driven, brain-based domains from multi-modal image data. In Aim 2, We will introduce network analysis (via Gaussian graphical models) to characterize heterogeneity in the interrelationship of RDoC measurements due to observed characteristics (i.e., age and sex). We will further model the heterogeneity of the population due to unobserved characteristics by introducing the data-driven precision phenotypes, which are the subgroup of participants with similar RDoC dimensions. We propose a Hierarchical Bayesian Generative Model and scalable algorithm for simultaneous dimension reduction and identify precision phenotypes. The model also serves as a tool to transfer information from the community sample ABCD to local clinical enriched studies. In aim 3, we will utilize the follow-up samples from ABCD and local clinical enriched data sets to validate the results from Aims 1 and 2 and assess the clinical utility of the precision phenotypes in predicting psychological development in follow-up time. Our project will provide a suite of analytical tools to validate existing RDoC constructs and derive new, reproducible constructs by accounting for various sources of heterogeneity. To advance the understanding of psychopathology using dimensional constructs of measurements from multiple units of analysis, we propose reproducible statistical framework for validating and deriving RDoC constructs with relevance to psychopathology. We will use multi-modal neuroimaging, behavioral and clinical/self-report data from multiple samples to develop this framework. The design of our study consists of analyzing large, nationally representative samples, validating the results in local clinically enriched samples, and transfer information from the large community samples to local clinical samples.",A Data Science Framework for Empirically Evaluating and Deriving Reproducible and Transferrable RDoC Constructs in Youth,10058921,R01MH124106,"['11 year old', 'Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychopathology', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'analytical tool', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'biological sex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,710101,-0.00887834137155787

"Meta-analysis in human brain mapping This is the competing renewal of R01MH074457-13, which sustains the BrainMap Project (www.brainmap.org). The overall goal of the BrainMap Project is to provide the human neuroimaging community with curated data sets, metadata, computational tools, and related resources that enable coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA), meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), meta-data informed interpretation (“decoding”) of imaging results, and meta-analytic priors for mining (including machine learning) primary (per-subject) neuroimaging data. To date, the BrainMap Project has designed and populated two coordinate-based databases: 1) a task-activation repository (TA DB); and, 2) a voxel-based morphometry repository (VBM DB). The TA DB contains >17,200 experiments, collectively representing > 78,000 subjects and > 110 task- activation paradigms. The VBM DB contains > 3,100 experiments, collectively representing > 81,000 subjects with > 80 psychiatric, neurologic and developmental disorders with ICD-10 coding. The BrainMap Project has created, optimized and validated an integrated pipeline of multi-platform (Javascript), open-access tools to curate (Scribe), filter and retrieve (Sleuth), analyze (GingerALE), visualize (Mango) and interpret analysis output (BrainMap meta-data plugins for Mango). Several network-modeling approaches have been applied to BrainMap data -- MACM, independent components analysis (ICA), graph theory modeling (GTM), author-topic modeling (ATM), structural equation modeling (SEM), and connectivity-based parcellation (CBP) – but none are yet pipeline components. Utilization of these CBMA resources is substantial: BrainMap software, data and meta-data have been used in > 825 peer-reviewed publications. Of these, > 350 were published within the current funding period (April 2015-March 2019; brainmap.org/pubs). In this competing renewal, four tool- development aims are proposed, each of which extends this high-impact research resource. Aim 1. Database Expansion. BrainMap data repositories will be expanded. Aim 2. Meta-analytic Network Modeling. Network modeling will be added to the BrainMap pipeline. Aim 3. Large-Scale Simulations, Comparisons and Validations. Data simulations, characterizations and validations will be performed. Aim 4. Meta-data Inferential tools. Tools for mining BrainMap’s location-linked meta-data will be expanded. Data Sharing Plan. BrainMap data, meta-data, pipeline tools, and templates created by whole-database modeling (e.g., ICA and ATM network masks) are shared at BrainMap.org. Of all new data entries, more than half are contributed by BrainMap users, i.e., community data sharing via BrainMap.org. For community-coded entries, the BrainMap team provides curation and quality control.

"Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instrumentation have not been fully leveraged to upgrade the information content of metabolomics datasets obtained from stable isotope labeling studies. This is primarily due to lack of validated software tools for extracting and interpreting isotope enrichments from HRMS datasets. The overall objective of the current application is to develop tools that enable the metabolomics community to fully leverage stable isotopes to profile metabolic network dynamics. Two new tools will be implemented within the open-source OpenMS software library, which provides an infrastructure for rapid development and dissemination of mass spectrometry software. The first tool will automate tasks required for extracting isotope enrichment information from HRMS datasets, and the second tool will use this information to group ion peaks into interaction networks based on similar patterns of isotope labeling. The tools will be validated using in-house datasets derived from metabolic flux studies of animal and plant systems, as well as through feedback from the metabolomics community. The rationale for the research is that the software tools will enable metabolomics investigators to address important questions about pathway dynamics and regulation that cannot be answered without the use of stable isotopes. The first aim is to develop a software tool to automate data extraction and quantification of isotopologue distributions from HRMS datasets. The software will provide several key features not included in currently available metabolomics software: i) a graphical, interactive user interface that is appropriate for non-expert users, ii) support for native instrument file formats, iii) support for samples that are labeled with multiple stable isotopes, iv) support for tandem mass spectra, and v) support for multi-group or time-series comparisons. The second aim is to develop a companion software that applies machine learning and correlation-based algorithms to group unknown metabolites into modules and pathways based on similarities in isotope labeling. The third aim is to validate the tools through comparative analysis of stable isotope labeling in test standards and samples from animal and plant tissues, including time-series and dual-tracer experiments. A variety of collaborators and professional working groups will be engaged to test and validate the software, and the tools will be refined based on their feedback. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it will provide the advanced software capabilities required for both targeted and untargeted analysis of isotopically labeled metabolites, but in a flexible and user-friendly environment. The research is significant because it will contribute software tools that automate and standardize the data processing steps required to extract and utilize isotope enrichment information from large-scale metabolomics datasets. This work will have an important positive impact on the ability of metabolomics investigators to leverage information from stable isotopes to identify unknown metabolic interactions and quantify flux within metabolic networks. In addition, it will enable entirely new approaches to study metabolic dynamics within biological systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop novel software tools to quantify and interpret data from stable isotope labeling experiments, which can be used to uncover relationships between metabolites and biochemical pathways. These tools have potential to accelerate progress toward identifying the causes and cures of many important diseases that impact metabolism.",Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets,10002192,U01CA235508,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Infrastructure', 'Ions', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'data standards', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'stable isotope', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'working group']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,427122,-0.007051846526749243
"Open Data-driven Infrastructure for Building Biomolecular Force Field for Predictive Biophysics and Drug Design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Molecular simulation is a powerful tool to predict the properties of biomolecules, interpret biophysical experiments, and design small molecules or biomolecules with therapeutic utility. However, a number of obstacles have impeded the development of quantitative, cloud-scale research workﬂows involving biomolecular simulation. Two main ob- stacles are the insufﬁcient accuracy of current atomistic models for biomolecules and small molecule therapeutics and the lack of interoperability in simulation toolchains used in both academic and industrial biomolecular research. Our original R01, “Open Data-driven Infrastructure for Building Biomolecular Force Fields for Predictive Bio- physics and Drug Design,” seeks to solve the ﬁrst problem. It helps fund our effort, the Open Force Field Initiative (https://openforceﬁeld.org) to develop open, extensible, and shared software and data infrastructure, implementing statistically robust methods of parameterizing force ﬁelds and choosing new force ﬁelds in a statistically sound manner. This work is designed to create not just a new generation of force ﬁelds, but an open technology to continue advancing force ﬁeld science. However, even with improved molecular models, putting together complete workﬂows of biomolecular simulations involves interfacing substantial numbers of different tools. However the majority of the existing molecular simulation workﬂows are mutually incompatible, with differing representations of the molecular models. The Open Force Field Initiative effort already includes the development of molecular data structures that we can ex- port into existing molecular simulation tools. We propose to extend the existing scope of our R01 to create an extensible common molecular simulation representation and translators to and from this representation. Such a set of tools will immediately make it signiﬁcantly easier to combine the disparate workﬂows developed for different sets of molecular simulation tools. Researchers will be able to set up and build the biophysical simulations using their usual tools, but run and analyze them with currently incompatible tools, enabling better matching of computational resources and methods to problems. It will help avoid trapping in a single software framework, and enable combinations of functionalities previously impossible without substantial developer time and effort. We will (Aim 1) work with partners to generalize our modular, extensible object model for representing parameterized biomolecular systems in a manner that accommodates the force ﬁeld terms currently supported by most popular biomolecular simulation packages. We will engineer it to be extensible to advanced interaction forms, such as polarizability and other multibody terms, and machine learning models for intermolecular forces. We will (Aim 2): enable easy conversion between components of molecular simulation workﬂows by allowing other molecular simulation packages to easily store their representations in this data model, developing converters that can import/export this object model to multiple popular ﬁle formats, focusing initially on OpenMM, AMBER, CHARMM, and GROMACS. We will demonstrate the utility of this interface in cloud-ready workﬂows. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists use computer simulations of proteins, DNA, and RNA, at atomic detail, to learn how these molecules of life carry out their functions and to design new medications. We aim to greatly increase the utility of all of these simulations by improving the accuracy of the formulas they use to compute the forces acting between atoms. This supplement will make it much easier for molecular simulation workﬂows to interoperate with each other in large-scale workﬂows.",Open Data-driven Infrastructure for Building Biomolecular Force Field for Predictive Biophysics and Drug Design,10166314,R01GM132386,"['Affinity', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'COVID-19', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Infrastructure', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'RNA', 'Readability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Framework', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'biomaterial interface', 'computing resources', 'data infrastructure', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'molecular modeling', 'open data', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'software infrastructure', 'sound', 'structured data', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2020,225000,-0.02060266913307076
"DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets Component type: This Knowledge Provider project will continue and significantly extend work done by the Translator Consortium Blue Team, focusing on deriving knowledge from real-world data through complex analytic workflows, integrated to the Translator Knowledge Graph, and served via tools like Big GIM and the Translator Standard API. The problem: We aim to solve the “first mile” problem of translational research: how to integrate the multitude of dynamic small-to-large data sets that have been produced by the research and clinical communities, but that are in different locations, processed in different ways, and in a variety of formats that may not be mutually interoperable. Integrating these data sets requires significant manual work downloading, reformatting, parsing, indexing and analyzing each data set in turn. The technical and ethical challenges of accessing diverse collections of big data, efficiently selecting information relevant to different users’ interests, and extracting the underlying knowledge are problems that remain unsolved. Here, we propose to leverage lessons distilled from our previous and ongoing big data analysis projects to develop a highly automated tool for removing these bottlenecks, enabling researchers to analyze and integrate many valuable data sets with ease and efficiency, and making the data FAIR [1]. Plan: (AIM 1) We will analyze and extract knowledge from rich real-world biomedical data sets (listed in the Resources page) in the domains of wellness, cancer, and large-scale clinical records. (AIM 2) We will formalize methods from Aim 1 to develop DOCKET, a novel tool for onboarding and integrating data from multiple domains. (AIM 3) We will work with other teams to adapt DOCKET to additional knowledge domains. ■ The DOCKET tool will offer 3 modules: (1) DOCKET Overview: Analysis of, and knowledge extraction from, an individual data set. (2) DOCKET Compare: Comparing versions of the same data set to compute confidence values, and comparing different data sets to find commonalities. (3) DOCKET Integrate: Deriving knowledge through integrating different data sets. ■ Researchers will be able to parameterize these functions, resolve inconsistencies, and derive knowledge through the command line, Jupyter notebooks, or other interfaces as specified by Translator Standards. ■ The outcome will be a collection of nodes and edges, richly annotated with context, provenance and confidence levels, ready for incorporation into the Translator Knowledge Graph (TKG). ■ All analyses and derived knowledge will be stored in standardized formats, enabling querying through the Reasoner Std API and ingestion into downstream AI assisted machine learning. ■ Example questions this will allow us to address include: (Wellness) Which clinical analytes, metabolites, proteins, microbiome taxa, etc. are significantly correlated, and which changing analytes predict transition to which disease? [2,3] (Cancer) Which gene mutations in any of X pathways are associated with sensitivity or resistance to any of Y drugs, in cell lines from Z tumor types? (All data sets) Which data set entities are similar to this one? Are there significant clusters? What distinguishes between the clusters? What significant correlations of attributes can be observed? How can this set of entities be expanded by adding similar ones? How do these N versions of this data set differ, and how stable is each knowledge edge as the data set changes over time? Collaboration strengths: Our team has extensive experience with biomedical and domainagnostic data analytics, integrating multiple relevant data types: omics, clinical measurements and electronic health records (EHRs). We have participated in large collaborative consortia and have subject matter experts willing to advise on proper data interpretation. Our application synergizes with those of other Translator teams (see Letters of Collaboration). Challenges: Data can come in a bewildering diversity of formats. Our solution will be modular, will address the most common formats first, and will leverage established technologies like DataFrames and importers (like pandas.io) where possible. Mapping nodes and edge types onto standard ontologies is crucial for knowledge integration; we will collaborate with the Standards component to maximize success. n/a",DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets,10057127,OT2TR003443,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'FAIR principles', 'Gene Mutation', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'experience', 'indexing', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge integration', 'large datasets', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT2,2020,609068,-0.027623896510384254
"Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology Project Summary Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs, and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor- binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animal–human interface. However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs, including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines, equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and block virus transmission. This knowledge will also help us develop rapid assays for monitoring emerging influenza threats at the animal–human interface. We also expect to develop a computational method for identifying glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms; this method will be able to be adapted to determine functional glycan motifs for other proteins, lectins, antibodies, antisera, and microorganisms, including those of other infectious pathogens, by using glycan arrays. Project Narrative This project will develop and apply a computational tool to identify glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms, and the derived knowledge will help us develop effective strategies for influenza prevention and control.",Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology,9895377,R21AI144433,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biosensor', 'Birds', 'Canis familiaris', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Domestic Fowls', 'Equus caballus', 'Family suidae', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune Sera', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lectin', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sea', 'Sialic Acids', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Strategic Planning', 'Streptavidin', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Tropism', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus Diseases', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'carbohydrate receptor', 'carbohydrate structure', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu transmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'microorganism', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protein profiling', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'respiratory', 'response', 'swine influenza', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'viral transmission', 'wild bird']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2020,239725,-0.04523231586678886
"Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) Project Summary In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas. Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown. Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health structures in Venezuela.  The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE- NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics, map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity. We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.  Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential to avert full-blown emergence. Project Narrative Arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika and Mayaro, are emerging at an accelerating rate in Central and South America. The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) project will provide a nimble and flexible network of surveillance sites in Central and South America coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter these threats to public health.",Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO),9968994,U01AI151807,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Americas', 'Animals', 'Arbovirus Infections', 'Arboviruses', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biodiversity', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brazil', 'Central America', 'Chikungunya virus', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Deforestation', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Habitats', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Panama', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'South America', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Venezuela', 'Virus', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'ZIKA', 'Zika Virus', 'Zoonoses', 'chikungunya', 'climate change', 'cohort', 'design', 'enzootic', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'insight', 'nanobodies', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prospective', 'seroconversion', 'surveillance network', 'transmission process', 'vector', 'vector control', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,U01,2020,1615615,-0.019752445327259147
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub.

"Center for Open Bioimage Analysis Project Summary  The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve the cell biology community’s growing need for sophisticated software for light microscopy image analysis. Quantitative image analysis has become an indispensable tool for biologists using microscopy throughout basic biological and biomedical research.  Quantifying images is now a critical, widespread need as imaging experiments continue to grow in scale, size, dimensionality, scope, modality, and complexity. Many biologists are missing out on the quantitative bioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and/or usable software for their needs, or lack of access to training. The Center brings together the Carpenter laboratory at the Broad Institute and the Eliceiri laboratory at the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and in doing so brings together the two most popular open source bioimage analysis projects, ImageJ (including ImageJ2 and FIJI) and CellProfiler. Through the collaborative development and dissemination of open source image analysis software, as well as training events and resources, the Center will empower thousands of researchers to apply advanced analytics in innovative ways to address new experimental areas.  Building on the team’s expertise developing algorithms and user­friendly software for use in biology under real­world conditions, the Center will focus on two Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects: deep learning­based image processing, and accessibility of image­processing algorithms for biologists. This work will not occur in isolation at the Center; rather, the Center will nucleate a larger community working on these two areas and serve as a catalyst and organizing force to create software and resources shared by all.  The Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) will serve a major role in driving the TR&D work: our teams are accustomed to working deeply and iteratively on problems side by side and with frequent feedback from biologists. This will ensure that important cell biological problems drive the work of the Center. The DBPs reflect tremendous variety in terms of biological questions, model systems, imaging modalities, and researcher expertise and will ensure robustness of our tools for the widest possible impact on the community. Continuing the teams’ track record with ImageJ and CellProfiler, two mature open source bioimage analysis software projects critical to the work of biologists worldwide, the Center will also assist and train biologists in applying the latest computational techniques to important biological problems involving images.  In short, the need for robust, accurate, and readily usable software is more urgent than ever. The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve as a hub for pioneering new computational strategies for diverse biological problems, translating them into user­friendly software, further developing ImageJ and CellProfiler, and training the biological community to apply advanced software to important and diverse problems in cell biology. Project Narrative Biologists studying a huge variety of diseases and basic biological processes need software to measure cells, tissues, and organisms in microscopy images. We will create the Center for Open Bioimage Analysis which will catalyze the scientific community, creating resources, free software, and training that allow biologists to analyze images using deep learning and other new image processing algorithms, offering improved accuracy, convenience, and reproducibility.",Center for Open Bioimage Analysis,9855767,P41GM135019,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Measures', 'Microscopy', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Organism', 'Organoids', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Software Engineering', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'catalyst', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'hackathon', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'skills', 'symposium', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",P41,2020,1835520,-0.003970181879486535
"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals). Project Narrative Biological assays are the foundation for developing drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolu- tionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that assays are written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized descriptions readable by computers. This lack of machine-readable annotations is a major impediment to manage, find, compare, re-use, and learn from the millions of assays. This project will develop a formal process and integrated tools to support the complete cycle of tasks and decisions required for bioassay annotation, enabling expedited (and more cost-effective) drug discovery.","Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols",9979969,U01LM012630,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Exercise', 'FAIR principles', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Hour', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polishes', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Readability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Update', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'informatics training', 'novel', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'public repository', 'repository', 'structured data', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2020,511367,-0.02417392246166815
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences.

"Next-generation Monte Carlo eXtreme Light Transport Simulation Platform Project Summary/Abstract Abstract: The rapid evolution of the field of biophotonics has produced numerous emerging techniques for combatting diseases and addressing urgent human health challenges, offering safe, non-invasive, and portable light-based diagnostic and therapeutic methods, and attracting exponentially growing attention over the past decade. Rigorous, fast, versatile and publicly available computational tools have played pivotal roles in the success of these novel approaches, leading to breakthroughs in new instrumentation designs and extensive explorations of complex biological systems such as human brains. The Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX, http://mcx.space) light transport simulation platform developed by our team has become one of the most widely disseminated biophotonics modeling platforms, known for its high accuracy, high speed and versatility, as attested to by its over 27,000 downloads and nearly 1,000 citations from a large (2,400+ registered users) world-wide user community. Over the past years, we have also been pushing the boundaries in cutting-edge Monte Carlo (MC) photon simulation algorithms by exploring modern GPU architectures, advanced anatomical modeling methods and systematic software optimizations. In this proposed project, we will build upon the strong momentum created in the initial funding period, and strive to further advance the state-of-the-art of GPU-accelerated MC light transport modeling with strong support from the world’s leading GPU manufacturers and experts, further expanding our platform to address a number of emerging challenges in biomedical optics applications. Specifically, we will further explore emerging GPU architecture and resources, such as ray- tracing cores, half- and mixed-precision hardware, and portable programming models, to further accelerate the MC modeling speed. We will also develop hybrid shape/mesh-based MC algorithms to dramatically advance the capability in simulating extremely complex yet realistic anatomical structures, such as porous tissues in the lung, dense vessel networks in the brain, and multi-scaled tissue domains. In parallel, we aim to make a break- through in applying deep-learning-based image denoising techniques to equivalently accelerate MC simulations by 2 to 3 orders of magnitudes, as suggested in our preliminary studies. In the continuation of this project, we strive to create a dynamic and community-engaging simulation environment by extending our software to allow users to create, share, browse, and reuse pre-configured simulations, avoiding redundant works in re-creating complex simulations and facilitating reproducible research. In addition, we will expand our well-received user training programs and widely disseminate our open-source tools via major Linux distributions and container images. At the end of this continued funding period, we will provide the community with a significantly accelerated, widely-available and well-supported biophotonics modeling platform that can handle multi-scaled tissue optical modeling ranging from microscopic to macroscopic domains. Project Narrative The Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX) light transport modeling platform has quadrupled its user community and paper citation numbers during the initial funding period. Building upon this strong momentum, we aim to further explore computational acceleration enabled by emerging GPU architectures and resources, and spearhead novel Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms to address the emerging needs of a broad biophotonics research community.

"Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots  Emergence of undervaccinated geographical clusters for diseases like measles has become a national concern. A number of measles outbreaks have occurred in recent months, despite high MMR coverage in the United States ( 95%). Such undervaccinated clusters can act as reservoirs of infection that can transmit the disease to a wider population, magnifying their importance far beyond what their absolute numbers might indicate. The existence and growth of such undervaccinated clusters is often known to public health agencies and health provider networks, but they typically do not have enough resources to target people in each such cluster, to attempt to improve the vaccination rate. Preliminary results show that not all undervaccinated clusters are “equal” in terms of their potential for causing a big outbreak (referred to as its “criticality”), and the rate of undervaccination in a cluster does not necessarily correlate with its criticality.  However, there are no existing methods to estimate the potential risk of such clusters, and to identify the most “critical” ones. Some of the key reasons are: (i) purely data-driven spatial statistics methods rely only on immunization coverage, which does not give any indication of the risk of an outbreak; and (ii) current causal epidemic models need to be combined with detailed incidence data, which has not been easily available.  This proposal brings together a systems science approach, combining agent-based stochastic epidemic models, and techniques from machine learning, high performance computing, data mining, and spatial statistics, along with novel public and private datasets on immunization and incidence, to develop a novel methodology for identifying critical clusters, through the following tasks: (i) Identify spatial clusters with signiﬁcantly low immunization rates, or strong anti-vaccine sentiment; (ii) Develop an agent based model for the spread of measles that incorporates detailed immunization data, and is calibrated using a novel source of incidence data; (iii) Develop methods to ﬁnd and characterize critical spatial clusters, with respect to different metrics, which capture both epidemic and economic burden, and order underimmunized clusters based on their criticality; and (iv) Use the methodology to evaluate interventions in terms of their effect on criticality. A highly interdisciplinary team involving two universities, a health care delivery organization and a state department of Health, will work together to develop this methodology. Characterization of such clusters will enable public health departments and policy makers in targeted surveillance of their regions and a more efﬁcient allocation of resources. Project Narrative  This project will develop a new methodology to quantify the potential risks of under-vaccinated spatial clusters for highly infectious diseases. It will rank the clusters based on their economic and epidemic burden which will enable public health ofﬁcials in targeted surveillance and interventions, to mitigate their risk.",Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots,9887876,R01GM109718,"['Affect', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral Model', 'California', 'Characteristics', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Clusterings', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Herd Immunity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'New Jersey', 'New York', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Resolution', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'diverse data', 'economic cost', 'economic outcome', 'health care delivery', 'health disparity', 'health organization', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'provider networks', 'public health intervention', 'social', 'social media', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,324178,-0.016597720438359415
"ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis Project Summary The morphology (or shape) of anatomical structures forms the common language among clinicians, where ab- normalities in anatomical shapes are often tied to deleterious function. While these observations are often quali- tative, ﬁnding subtle, quantitative shape effects requires the application of mathematics, statistics, and computing to parse the anatomy into a numerical representation that will facilitate testing of biologically relevant hypotheses. Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of software tools, ShapeWorks, enable learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image seg- mentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. Despite its obvious utility for the research enterprise and highly permissive open-source license, ShapeWorks does not have a viable commercialization path due to the inherent trade-off between development and maintenance costs, and a specialized scientiﬁc and clinical market. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread ap- plicability to medicine and biology is hindered by several barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The most important roadblocks are (1) the complexity and steep learning curve of existing shape modeling pipelines and their increased computational and computer memory requirements; (2) the considerable expertise, time, and effort required to segment anatomies of interest for statistical analyses; and (3) the lack of interoperable implementations that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research laboratories. In this project, we pro- pose ShapeWorksStudio, a software suite that leverages ShapeWorks for the automated population-/patient-level modeling of anatomical shapes, and Seg3D – a widely used open-source tool to visualize and process volumet- ric images – for ﬂexible manual/semiautomatic segmentation and interactive manual correction of segmented anatomy. In Aim 1, we will integrate ShapeWorks and Seg3D in a framework that supports big data cohorts to enable users to transparently proceed from image data to shape models in a straightforward manner. In Aim 2, we will endow Seg3D with a machine learning approach that provides automated segmentations within a statisti- cal framework that combines image data with population-speciﬁc shape priors provided by ShapeWorks. In Aim 3, we will support interoperability with existing open-source software packages and toolkits, and provide bindings to commonly used programming languages in the biomedical research community. To promote reproducibility, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc test cases. This project combines an interdisciplinary research and development team with decades of experience in statistical analysis and image understanding, and application scientists to conﬁrm that the proposed developments have a real impact on the biomedical and clinical research communities. Our long-term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. ShapeWorks has been effective in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, cardiology, and orthopedics. If funded, this application will ensure the viability of ShapeWorks in the face of the ever-increasing complexity of shape datasets and support its availability to biomedical researchers in the future, as well as provide opportunities for use in a wide spectrum of new biological and clinical applications, including anatomy reconstruction from sparse/low- dimensional imaging data, large-scale clinical trials, surgical planning, optimal designs of medical implants, and reconstructive surgery.","ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis",10023935,U24EB029011,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Mail', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Psychology', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'medical implant', 'open source', 'outreach', 'particle', 'patient population', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2020,256578,-0.009213937955812407
"Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases 7. Project Summary/Abstract There is an urgent need to support research that generates high-quality evidence to inform clinical decision making. Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) achieve the highest standard of evidence for the evaluation of community-level effectiveness of intervention strategies against infectious diseases. However, there is a need to develop new methods to improve the design and analysis of CRTs because unique and complicated analytical challenges arise in such settings. One such issue relates to the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the degree to which individuals within a community are more similar to one another than to individuals in other communities. Design and analysis of CRTs must take into account the ICC. Lack of accurate information on the ICC jeopardizes the power of CRTs, leads to suboptimal choices of analysis methods and complicates the interpretation of study results. However, reliable information on the ICC is difficult to obtain. A robust and efficient approach for estimating ICCs is based on the second-order generalizing estimating equations. However, its use has been limited by considerable computational burden and poor convergence rates associated with the existing algorithms solving these equations. The first aim addresses these computational challenges. Missing data are ubiquitous and can lead to bias and loss of efficiency. The second aim proposes to develop novel robust and efficient methods for estimating ICCs in the presence of informative missing data. For infectious diseases, the underlying contact/transmission networks give rise to complicated correlation structure. The third aim is to develop network and epidemic models to project the ICC. User-friendly software will be developed to facilitate the implementation of new methods. An immediate application of the proposed methods is their application to the Botswana Combination Prevention Project to improve the estimation of intervention effect and to generate reliable ICC estimates for designing future CRTs in the same population. The proposed methods can be applied to other ongoing and future CRTs, and more broadly, to longitudinal studies and agreement studies where ICCs are also of great interest. The proposed research is significant, because success in addressing these issues will improve the ability to design efficient and well-powered CRTs and the precision in estimating the effects of intervention strategies. Innovation lies in the development of improved computing algorithms adapting approaches from deep learning, the use of semiparametric efficiency theory, and the integration of network modeling, epidemic modeling and statistical inference. The results of the proposed research will benefit both ongoing and future CRTs, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately expedite the control of infectious diseases. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because improved methodologies for the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials will benefit both ongoing and future studies, permit more efficient use of the resources, and ultimately improve public health response intended to control the spread of infectious diseases. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIAID’s mission that pertains to conducting and supporting research to prevent infectious diseases and to respond to emerging public health threats.",Network modeling and robust estimation of the intraclass correlation coefficient to inform the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials for infectious diseases,10011756,R01AI136947,"['AIDS prevention', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Botswana', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ebola', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Epidemic', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'collaboratory', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'high standard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'success', 'systems research', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'user friendly software']",NIAID,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2020,247413,-0.0035050481080045426
"ShapeWorks in the Cloud Project Summary This application is submitted in response to NOT-OD-20-073 as an administrative supplement to the parent award R01AR076120 titled: ""Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches."" The form (or shape) of anatomies is the clinical language that describes abnormal mor- phologies tied to pathologic functions. Quantifying such subtle morphological shape changes requires parsing the anatomy into a quantitative description that is consistent across the population in question. For more than 100 years, morphometrics has been an indispensable quantitative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms. But its representation capacity is limited to linear distances, angles, and areas. Sta- tistical shape modeling (SSM) is the computational extension of classical morphometric techniques to analyze more detailed representations of complex anatomy and their variability within populations The parent award ad- dresses existing roadblocks for the widespread adoption of SSM computational tools in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of open-source software tools, ShapeWorks. ShapeWorks enables learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image segmentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread applicability and impact to medicine and biology are hindered by computational barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The goal of this supplement award is to provide supplemental support for Aim 3 of the parent award to leverage best practices in software development and advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large-scale cohorts to build and execute custom SSM workﬂows us- ing remote scalable computational resources. To achieve this goal, we have developed a plan to enhance the design, implementation, and cloud-readiness of ShapeWorks and augmented our scientiﬁc team to add senior, experienced software engineers/developers who have extensive experience in professional programming, code refactoring, and scientiﬁc computing. This award will provide our team with the support necessary to (Aim 1) de- sign ShapeWorks as a collection of modular and reusable services, (Aim 2) decouple ShapeWorks services from explicitly encoded data sources, and (Aim 3) refactor ShapeWorks to scale efﬁciently on the cloud. All software development will be performed in adherence to software engineering practices and design principles, including coding style, documentation, and version control. The proposed efforts will be released as open-source software in a manner consistent with the principles of reproducible research and the practices of open science. Our long- term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein in addition to the parent award will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. The impact and scientiﬁc value of ShapeWorks have been recognized in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, car- diology, and orthopedics. If funded, this supplement will provide support to revise, refactor, and redeploy Shape- Works to take advantage of new cloud computing paradigms, to be robust, sustainable, scalable, and accessible to a broader community, and to address the growing need for shape modeling tools to handle large collections of clinical data and to obtain sufﬁcient statistical power for large shape studies.",ShapeWorks in the Cloud,10166337,R01AR076120,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Applied Research', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disabled Persons', 'Documentation', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Orthopedics', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Psychology', 'Readiness', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Source Code', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data management', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'model development', 'open data', 'open source', 'particle', 'response', 'scientific computing', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,210000,0.013722286925485582
"Sample-specific Models for Molecular Portraits of Diseases in Precision Medicine A fundamental challenge in precision medicine is to understand the patterns of differentiation between individuals. To address this challenge, we propose to go beyond the traditional `one disease--one model' view of bioinformatics and pursue a new view built upon personalized patient models that facilitates precision medicine by leveraging both commonalities within a patient cohort as well as signatures unique to every individual patient. With the emergence of large-scale databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), which collect multi-omic data on many different diseases, a new “pan-omics” and “pan-disease” paradigm has emerged to jointly analyze all patients in a disease cohort while accounting for patient-specific effects. An example of this is the recently released Pan-Cancer Atlas. At the same time, next generation statistical tools to accurately and rigorously draw the necessary inferences are lacking. In this project we propose a series of mathematically rigorous, statistically sound, and computationally feasible approaches to infer sample-specific models, providing a more complete view of heterogeneous datasets. By bringing together ideas from the machine learning, statistics, and mathematical optimization communities, we provide a rigorous framework for precision medicine via sample-specific statistical models. Crucially, we propose to analyze this framework and prove strong theoretical guarantees under weak assumptions--this dramatically distinguishes our framework from much of the existing literature. Towards these goals, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Discovery of new molecular profiles with sample-specific statistical models. We propose a general framework for inferring sample-specific models with low-rank structure based on the novel concept of distance-matching. This allows us to infer statistical models at the level of a single patient without overfitting, and is general enough to be applied for prediction, classification, and network inference as well as a variety of diseases and phenotypes. Aim 2: Multimodal approaches to personalized diagnosis--contextually interpretable models for actionable clinical decision support. In order to translate these models into practice, we propose a novel interpretable predictive model that supports complex, multimodal data types such as images and text combined with high-level interpretable features such as SNP data, gender, age, etc. This framework simultaneously boosts the accuracy of clinical predictions by exploiting sample heterogeneity while providing human-digestable explanations for the predictions being made. Aim 3: Next-generation precision medicine--algorithms and software for personalized estimation. To put our models into practical use, we will develop new algorithms for interpretable prediction of personalized clinical outcomes and visualization of personalized statistical models. All of our tools will be combined into a user-friendly software package called PrecisionX that will be freely available to researchers and clinicians everywhere. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Personalization with data is a critical challenge whenever decisions must be made at scale, and has applications that go beyond precision medicine; businesses, educational institutions, and financial institutions are among the many players that have acknowledged a stake in this complex problem. We expect the proposed work to provide a rigorous foundation for personalization with large and high-dimensional datasets, finding use throughout the broader scientific community as well as with industry and educational institutions. Alongside our collaboration with Pitt/UPMC, we will work with physicians and data scientists for practical feedback as well as provide training in the methods developed. n/a",Sample-specific Models for Molecular Portraits of Diseases in Precision Medicine,10133782,R01GM140467,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Bioinformatics', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'International', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Portraits', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Text', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'individual patient', 'large-scale database', 'molecular modeling', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'sound', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,305566,-0.015217017771942462
"Computational and Statistical Framework to Model Tissue Shape and Mechanics PROJECT SUMMARY  The morphologic and mechanical characteristics of a tissue are fundamental to understanding the development, homeostasis, and pathology of the human body. During the previous period of funding, we developed statistical shape modeling (SSM) methods and applied these to the study of structural hip disease. We also developed the initial framework to integrate SSM with finite element (FE) analysis to enable the study of shape and mechanics together. If incorporated into clinical practice, SSM and FE analysis could identify features of the anatomy likely responsible for injury, remodeling, or repair. Geometry needed for SSM and FE models is typically generated by segmentation of volumetric imaging data. This step can be painstakingly slow, error prone, and cost prohibitive, which hampers clinical application of these computational techniques. We have created a deep machine learning algorithm ‘DeepSSM’ that uses a convolutional neural network to establish the correspondence model directly from unsegmented images. In Aim 1 we will apply DepSSM to improve clinical understanding of structural hip disease by characterizing differences in anatomy between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals; these morphometric comparisons will identify anatomic features most telling of disease, thereby guiding improvements in diagnosis. Computational advancements have simplified the process to generate patient-specific FE models, enabling clinically focused research. However, there is no framework to collectively visualize, compare, and interpret (i.e., post-process) results from multiple FE models. Currently, inter-subject comparisons require oversimplifications such as averaging results over subjectively defined regions. In Aim 2 we will develop new post-processing methods to collectively visualize, interpret and statistically analyze FE results across multiple subjects and study groups. We will map FE results to synthetic anatomies representing statistically meaningful distributions using the correspondence model. Statistical parametric mapping will be applied to preserve anatomic detail through statistical testing. We will use our published FE models of hip joint mechanics as the test system. Finally, volumetric images provide a wealth of information that is delivered to physicians in a familiar format. Yet, tools are not available to interpret model data with clinical findings from volumetric images. In Aim 3, we will develop methods that evaluate relationships between shape, mechanics, and clinical findings gleaned from imaging through integrated statistical tests and semi-automatic medical image annotation tools that utilize standard ontologies. Quantitative CT and MRI images of the hip, which estimate bone density and cartilage ultrastructure, respectively, will be evaluated as test datasets. To impart broad impact, we will disseminate our methods to the community as open source software that will call core functionality provided by existing, open source software that has a large user base (FEBio, ShapeWorks). PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed technology will provide the methodologies necessary to increase the clinical acceptance and applicability of computer models. These models measure three-dimensional tissue shape and estimate tissue mechanics, providing information that cannot be measured conventionally. We will implement these methods into software that can be used by the public free-of-charge.",Computational and Statistical Framework to Model Tissue Shape and Mechanics,9972694,R01EB016701,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Bone Density', 'Cardiology', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Glean', 'Grooming', 'Hip Joint', 'Hip region structure', 'Homeostasis', 'Human Pathology', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurology', 'Ontology', 'Orthopedics', 'Pathology', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'disease diagnosis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,563658,-0.003262795832886069
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections. Validating the molecular targets of these compounds for in vivo nerve growth will enable future drug discovery projects focused on these targets.",Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury,9917854,R01NS100531,"['Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Complement 5a', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Control Animal', 'Contusions', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Failure', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery of Function', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Viral Vector', 'Walking', 'axon growth', 'axon regeneration', 'axonal sprouting', 'behavior test', 'behavioral outcome', 'central nervous system injury', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injured', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'light microscopy', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'targeted agent', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,465464,-0.02945061209250267
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility.

"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology.

"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,9853783,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2020,167900,-0.01335297775617609
"Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software. Abstract (Proposal title: Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational and Data Processing Tools and Software.): This proposal presents a focused plan for expanding the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) to meet the evolving needs of neuroscientists engaged in computationally intensive research. The NSG project began in 2012 with support from the NSF. Its initial goal was to catalyze progress in computational neuroscience by reducing technical and administrative barriers that neuroscientists faced in large scale modeling projects involving tools and software which require and run efficiently on high performance computing (HPC) resources. NSG's success is reflected in the facts that (1) its base of registered users has grown continually since it started operation in early 2013 (more than 800 at present), (2) every year the NSG team successfully acquires ever larger allocations of supercomputer time (recently more than 10,000,000 core hours/year) on academic HPC resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery (XSEDE – that coordinates NSF supercomputer centers) program by writing proposals that go through an extremely competitive peer review process, and (3) it has contributed to large number of publications and Ph.D thesis. In recent years experimentalists, cognitive neuroscientists and others have begun using NSG for brain image data processing, data analysis and machine learning. NSG now provides over 20 tools on HPC resources for modeling, simulation and data processing. While NSG is currently well used by the neuroscience community, there is increasing interest from that community in applying it to a wider range of tasks than originally conceived. For example, some are trying to use it as an environment for dissemination of lab-developed tools, even though NSG is not suitable for that use because of delays from the batch queue wait times of production HPC resources, and lack of features and resources for an interactive, graphical, and collaborative environment needed for tool development, benchmarking and testing. “Forced” use of NSG for development and dissemination makes NSG's operators a “person-in-the-middle” bottleneck in the process. Another issue is that newly developed data processing tools require high throughput computing (HTC) usage mode, as opposed to HPC, but currently NSG does not provide access to compute resources suitable for HTC. Additionally, data processing workflows require features such as the ability to transfer large size data, process shared data, and visualize output results, which are not currently available on NSG. The work we propose will enhance NSG by adding the features that it needs to be a suitable and efficient dissemination environment for lab-developed neuroscience tools to the broader neuroscience community. This will allow tool developers to disseminate their lab-developed tools on NSG taking advantage of the current functionalities that are being well served on NSG for the last six years such as a growing user base, an easy user interface, an open environment, the ability to access and run jobs on powerful compute resources, availability of free supercomputer time, a well-established training and outreach program, and a functioning user support system. All of these well-functioning features of NSG will make it an ideal environment for dissemination and use of lab-developed computational and data processing neuroscience tools. The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) was first implemented to enable large scale computational modeling of brain cells and circuits used to study neural function in health and disease. This new project extends NSG's utility to support development, dissemination and use of new tools by the neuroscience community for analyzing enormous data sets produced by advanced experimental methods in neuroscience.",Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software.,10019388,U24EB029005,"['Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain cell', 'collaborative environment', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'image processing', 'interest', 'models and simulation', 'open data', 'operation', 'outreach program', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trend', 'webinar']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2020,381282,-0.004743088196666927
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host, modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however, neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4- ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii) elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the reprogramming therapies, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal aims to define the bacterial species and genes that make these compounds and how the gut microbiota can be rationally altered to reduce the production of toxic substances.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9973004,R01DK101674,"['Ablation', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cresol', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Diet Modification', 'Ecosystem', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Individuality', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Process', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Sulfate', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Uremia', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'colon microbiota', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human subject', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstitution', 'solute', 'tool', 'translation to humans']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,690557,-0.03837303167274721
"The University of Iowa Clinical and Translational Science Award ABSTRACT The Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) at the University of Iowa (UI) was established by the Board of Regents to realize three objectives – first, to lead the development of translational science at the UI; second, to advance translational science as a distinct academic discipline; and third, to disseminate capacities in translational science across the State of Iowa. This mandate enabled us to tackle large problems affecting translational science that required institutional solutions, such as transforming regulatory processes for human subjects research, developing an informatics infrastructure for integrating electronic medical record and other health care data, establishing bi-directional relationships with community organizations, and revitalizing the pipeline of well trained clinical and translational researchers. Iowa is a rural state, which brings special health care needs and challenges. We have used these rural considerations as a catalyst for driving our approach to clinical and translational research pushing our teams to develop strategies to engage rural populations of all ages and backgrounds and to create new approaches that overcome the geographic barriers in a rural state. We are capitalizing on our established community practice networks of family physicians, clinics, school nurses and pharmacists. We utilize e Health/ e Learning platforms in novel ways and will test the efficacy of these new methods of engagement. As we move research “Beyond Our Borders,” we have created methods to capture real-time, real-life data from the home and to correlate this environmentally specific, comprehensive data to human performance. The ICTS is engaging with other CTSA hubs and national CTR systems to empirically test different approaches and to develop the evidence base of proven strategies for accelerating translation that can be more broadly disseminated. Though distance and rurality drive our approaches, the strategies that we develop are simply new and potentially better ways to generate broad representation and improved participation by patients, healthcare teams and academicians. Through our local, state and national partnerships, UI and the ICTS are poised to move clinical and translational discovery rapidly into healthcare practice in a variety of clinical settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the University of Iowa Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) is to accelerate translational science through programs to develop the translational workforce, promote the engagement of community members and other stakeholders, to promote research integration across the lifespan, and to catalyze innovative clinical and translational research. The ongoing development of collaborative data-based infrastructure and services is a central tenant to achieving this mission. The goals of this proposal are: for Iowa to join the N3C partnership, contributing data in an effective method that evolves and improves over time, to enable Iowa researchers to leverage the N3C data resource in their research and to leverage the N3C framework for other areas of research in the future.",The University of Iowa Clinical and Translational Science Award,10201104,UL1TR002537,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'COVID-19', 'Caring', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Emergency Situation', 'Family Physicians', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Subject Research', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Rural Health', 'Rural Population', 'School Nursing', 'Services', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfer Agreement', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'catalyst', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'collaborative approach', 'community organizations', 'coronavirus disease', 'data acquisition', 'data enclave', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pandemic disease', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'rurality', 'social determinants', 'support tools', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,UL1,2020,98933,-0.02506722330847091
"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE MC-IU effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing, exploration, and download of different types of tissue and individual cell data. The CCF will use different visual interfaces in order to exploit human and machine intelligence to improve data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, biology, and biomedical data standards. The goal is to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimensional spatial basemap of the human body with associated data overlays. This basemap will be designed for online exploration as an atlas of tissue maps composed of diverse cell types, developed in close collaboration with the HIVE MC-NYGC team. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across multiple levels (whole body, organ, tissue, cells). MC-IU will work in close collaboration with the HIVE Infrastructure and Engagement Component (IEC) and tools components (TCs) to connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources driven by spatial context. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an extensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spatial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical. This project will work in close coordination with the HuBMAP consortium to help drive an ecosystem of useful resources for understanding and leveraging high-resolution human image data and to compile a human body atlas.","The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector and Meta Datasets",10148333,OT2OD026671,"['Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecosystem', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human BioMolecular Atlas Program', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Organ', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Tissues', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'data exploration', 'data standards', 'design', 'human imaging', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'tool', 'vector']",OD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,OT2,2020,1000000,-0.031107712959480522
"Multi-Resolution Docking Methods for Electron Microscopy Summary In the past decade, we have witnessed a revolutionary progress in camera technology and the attainable resolution of macromolecular assemblies via cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and in the development of computational algorithms that relate the resulting 3D maps to atomic resolution structures. Whereas single- particle cryo-EM today is capable of directly solving atomic structures of biomolecular assemblies in isolation, electron tomography (ET) in unstained frozen-hydrated samples is widely used to capture the 3D organization of supramolecular complexes in their native (organelle, cell, or tissue) environments. We have identified three inter-related research areas where our computational modeling experience (historically rooted in pre-revolution multi-scale approaches) offers the biggest value to today's post-revolution EM community: (1) medium resolution cryo-EM modeling, (2) the segmentation and denoising of cryo-ET data, and (3) the validation of atomic models and their corresponding maps. The first aim is an extension of promising new ideas in flexible fitting as well as secondary structure prediction for medium resolution maps, which have been our key research areas in the past. medium resolution (5-10Å) maps are still widely used in EM and can be of significant biological importance. This is particularly true in the case of cryo-ET maps, which are harder to read than single particle cryo-EM maps because they often exhibit considerable noise, anisotropic resolution, and anisotropic density variations due to the low dose requirements and the missing wedge in the Fourier space. In the case of tightly packed or crowded macromolecular structures, the fusion of nearby biomolecular densities prevents an automated segmentation of geometric shapes, requiring a labor-intensive manual tracing by human experts. We are currently developing novel computational approaches to provide a more objective strategy for missing wedge correction in homogeneous specimen areas of tomograms. Our hybrid approach combines deconvolution and denoising with template matching in a unified mathematical framework that allows modeling constraints to be imposed in a least-squares optimization process. Our approach can also be extended to the flexible refinement of atomic structures using our damped dynamics flexible fitting approach by tuning the internal point-spread functions to the missing wedge of the ET data. To support these aims, we will quantitatively measure the fitness of an atomic model in local density regions and characterize the fitness of maps with reliable reference structures. The collaborative efforts supported by this grant will include the refinement of cytoskeletal filaments, molecular motors, bacterial chemoreceptor arrays, and hair cell stereocilia. The algorithmic and methodological developments will be distributed freely through the established Internet-based mechanisms used by the Situs and Sculptor packages and as plugins for the popular UCSF Chimera graphics program. Project Narrative This project will help biological electron microscopists bridge a broad range of resolution levels, from the atomic to the living organism. Macromolecular assemblies are the basic functional units of biological cells; they furnish targets for drug design because deficiencies in macromolecular assembly architecture are frequently linked to health problems.

"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and affect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable of discovering local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest. The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image datasets is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focuses on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of image based morphometric analysis to be able to discover regionally varying deterioration and alteration of matter without the need for fine-grained segmentations and a priori definitions of regions of interest.",Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets,10139715,R42MH118845,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'HIV', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Software Validation', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Washington', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'data access', 'data infrastructure', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high throughput screening', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'metabolic rate', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodegenerative dementia', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'regional difference', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'software infrastructure', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'usability', 'web app', 'web services', 'white matter']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R42,2020,456359,-0.020082977785047338
"FluMod - Center for the Multiscale Modeling of Pandemic and seasonal Flu Prevention and Control PROJECT SUMMARY In this proposal we plan to contribute addressing the above foundational and operational challenges by advancing the science of influenza modeling and contributing novel methods and data sources that will increase the accuracy and availability of seasonal and pandemic influenza models. To address these challenges, we plan to build on the unique mechanistic spatially structured modeling approaches developed by our consortium, that includes stochastic metapopulation models and fully developed agent-based models nested together in our global epidemic and mobility modeling (GLEAM) approach. The objective of this project is to generate novel and actionable scientific insights from dynamic transmission models of influenza transmission that effectively integrate key socio-demographic indicators of the focus population, as well as a wide spectrum of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our proposed work in specific aim 1 (A1) will leverage our global modeling (from the global to local scale) framework that can be used to explore the multi-year impact of influenza vaccination, antiviral prophylaxis/treatment, and community mitigation during influenza seasons and pandemics. Our specific aim 2 (A2) will focus on using high quality data to model heterogeneous transmission drivers and novel contact pattern stratifications that will allow us to guide mitigation strategies and prioritization for interventions. In our Aim 3 (A3) we will use artificial intelligence approaches to identify interventions that are particularly synergistic and well-suited to particular epidemic scenarios, for seasonal and pandemic influenza. Our overarching goal is to provide a modeling portfolio with flexible and innovative mathematical and computational approaches. We aim to address several questions commonly asked about seasonal and pandemic influenza and match these with analytical methods and outbreak projections. The modeling and data developed in this project can help facilitate and justify transparent public health decisions, while contributing to the definition of standard methods for model selection and validation. Finally, our influenza modeling platform can also benefit the broader network of modeling teams and can be used to improve result sharing and harmonization of modeling approaches. The objective of this proposal is to advance the science of modeling and contribute novel methods and data analytics tools that will increase the understanding of seasonal and pandemic influenza in the context of the network of modeling teams coordinated by the CDC. To address these challenges, we plan to develop a novel global modeling framework, contribute new data and methods for improve the accuracy and validation of flu modeling approaches, and evolve successful methodologies to advance the analysis of layered intervention with artificial Intelligence.",FluMod - Center for the Multiscale Modeling of Pandemic and seasonal Flu Prevention and Control,10071782,U01IP001137,[' '],NCIRD,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,371721,-0.007247021043206761
"PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry Project Summary Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research, there has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. Such sharing, evaluation, and integration are necessary if computational modeling efforts are to be useful not only in generating reliable and accurate accounts of how brain subsystems operate, but also of how they interact to give rise to higher cognitive functions, and how disruptions of such interactions may give rise to disturbances of mental function observed in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This proposal seeks to meet this need by developing PsyNeuLink: an open source, Python-based software environment that makes it easy to create new models, import and/or re-implement existing ones, integrate these within a single software environment that will facilitate head-to-head comparison of comparable models, the assembly of complementary models into system-level models, and serve as a common repository for the documentation and dissemination of such models for both research and didactic purposes (i.e., publication, education, etc.). These goals will be pursued under two Specific Aims: 1) Extend the scope of modeling efforts that PsyNeuLink can accommodate by: i) enhancing its application programmer interface (API) used to add new components and interfaces to statistical analysis tools and other modeling environments (such as PyTorch, Emergent and ACT-R; ii) enriching its Library by adding PsyNeuLink implementations of influential models of neural subsystems; and iii) developing a publicly available workbook of simulation exercises as both an introduction to PsyNeuLink and for use in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry curricula. 2) Accelerate PsyNeuLink by developing a custom compiler that preserves its simplicity and flexibility, while dramatically increasing its speed, to make it suitable for simulation of large and complex system-level models, and for parameter estimation, model fitting, and model comparison. This project will exploit the power and accelerating use of Python, and modern just-in-time compilation methods to develop a tool designed specifically for the needs of systems-level Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry. This promises to open up new opportunities for research at the systems-level — a level of analysis that is crucial both for understanding how human mental function emerges from the interplay among neural subsystems, and how disturbances of individual neural subsystems impact this interplay, disruptions of which are almost certainly a critical factor in neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. This proposed project seeks to address this need by developing a standard software platform for the construction, documentation, sharing, and integration of computational models of brain function, that promises to accelerate the study of how system-level interactions give rise to mental function and, critically, the kinds of disruptions of such system-level interactions produced by disturbances of individual subsystems — disruptions that are sure to be a complex but critical factor in neurological and psychiatric disorders.",PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry,9976610,R21MH117548,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Perceptual learning', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Writing', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'flexibility', 'head-to-head comparison', 'improved', 'learning network', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'open source', 'parallelization', 'preservation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,197545,-0.02182540479640118
"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers. The proposed research will generate a model of how data science and network analysis can be used to understand the implementation of a complex evidence-based practice.",A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,9963341,R01HL140362,"['Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Community Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Environment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Height', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypoxemia', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intensive Care Units', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nurses', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Professional Organizations', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tidal Volume', 'Variant', 'base', 'community setting', 'complex data ', 'computer science', 'dissemination research', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'health care settings', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'lung injury', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'respiratory', 'response', 'theories', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2020,745390,-0.017849033555357472
"Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data Project Summary This project develops novel statistical inference procedures for biomedical big data (BBD), including data from diverse omics platforms, various medical imaging technologies and electronic health records. Statistical inference, i.e., assess- ing uncertainty, statistical signiﬁcance and conﬁdence, is a key step in computational pipelines that aim to discover new disease mechanisms and develop effective treatments using BBD. However, the development of statistical inference procedures for BBD has lagged behind technological advances. In fact, while point estimation and variable selection procedures for BBD have matured over the past two decades, existing inference procedures are either limited to simple methods for marginal inference and/or lack the ability to integrate biomedical data across multiple studies and plat- forms. This paucity is, in large part, due to the challenges of statistical inference in high-dimensional models, where the number of features is considerably larger than the number of subjects in the study. Motivated by our team's extensive and complementary expertise in analyzing multi-omics data from heterogenous studies, including the TOPMed project on which multiple team members currently collaborate, the current proposal aims to address these challenges. The ﬁrst aim of the project develops a novel inference procedure for conditional parameters in high-dimensional models based on dimension reduction, which facilitates seamless integration of external biological information, as well as biomedical data across multiple studies and platforms. To expand the application of this method to very high-dimensional models that arise in BBD applications, the second aim develops a data-adaptive screening procedure for selecting an optimal subset of relevant variables. The third aim develops a novel inference procedure for high-dimensional mixed linear models. This method expands the application domain of high-dimensional inference procedures to studies with longitu- dinal data and repeated measures, which arise commonly in biomedical applications. The fourth aim develops a novel data-driven procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), which facilitates the integration of evidence from multiple BBD sources, while minimizing the false negative rate (FNR) for optimal discovery. Upon evaluation using ex- tensive simulation experiments and application to multi-omics data from the TOPMed project, the last aim implements the proposed methods into easy-to-use open-source software tools leveraging the R programming language and the capabilities of the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments for BBD methods and tools. Public Health Relevance Biomedical big data (BBD), including large collections of omics data, medical imaging data, and electronic health records, offer unprecedented opportunities for discovering disease mechanisms and developing effective treatments. However, despite their tremendous potential, discovery using BBD has been hindered by computational challenges, including limited advances in statistical inference procedures that allow biomedical researchers to investigate uncon- founded associations among biomarkers of interest and various biological phenotypes, while integrating data from multiple BBD sources. The current proposal bridges this gap by developing novel statistical machine learning methods and easy-to-use open-source software for statistical inference in BBD, which are designed to facilitate the integration of data from multiple studies and platforms.",Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data,9969887,R01GM133848,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Galaxy', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'R programming language ', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'computational pipelines', 'data integration', 'design', 'diverse data', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,456980,-0.03481561690795301
"Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets Project Summary  Morphometric analysis is a primary algorithmic tool to discover disease and drug related effects on brain anatomy. Neurological degeneration and disease manifest in subtle and varied changes in brain anatomy that can be non-local in nature and effect amounts of white and gray matter as well as relative positioning and shapes of local brain anatomy. State-of-the-art morphometry methods focus on local matter distribution or on shape variations of apriori selected anatomies but have difficulty in detecting global or regional deterioration of matter; an important effect in many neurodegenerative processes. The proposal team recently developed a morphometric analysis based on unbalanced optimal transport, called UTM, that promises to be capable to discover local and global alteration of matter without the need to apriori select an anatomical region of interest.  The goal of this proposal is to develop the UTM technology into a software tool for automated high-throughput screening of large neurological image data sets. A more sensitive automated morphometric analysis tool will help researchers to discover neurological effects related to disease and lead to more efficient screening for drug related effects. Project Narrative  Describing anatomical differences in neurological image data set is a key technology to non-invasively discover the effects of disease processes or drug treatments on brain anatomy. Current morphometric analysis focus on local matter composition and on the shape of a priori defined regions of interest. The goal of this proposal is to extend the capabilities of image based morphometric analysis to be able to discover regionally varying deterioration and alteration of matter without the need for fine-grained segmentations and a priori definitions of regions of interest.",Enhanced Software Tools for Detecting Anatomical Differences in Image Data Sets,10115288,R41MH118845,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'high throughput screening', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'web services', 'white matter']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R41,2020,99860,-0.019456762042460777
"A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks New advances in biomedical research have made it possible to collect multiple data “views” — for example, genetic, metabolomic, and clinical data — for a single patient. Such multi-view data promises to offer deeper insights into a patient's health and disease than would be possible if just one data view were available. However, in order to achieve this promise, new statistical methods are needed.  This proposal involves developing statistical methods for the analysis of multi-view data. These methods can be used to answer the following fundamental question: do the data views contain redundant information about the observations, or does each data view contain a different set of information? The answer to this question will provide insight into the data views, as well as insight into the observations. If two data views contain redundant information about the observations, then those two data views are related to each other. Furthermore, if each data view tells the same “story” about the observations, then we can be quite conﬁdent that the story is true.  The investigators will develop a uniﬁed framework for modeling multi-view data, which will then be applied in a number of settings. In Aim 1, this framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data (e.g. a single set of patients, with both clinical and genetic measurements), in order to determine whether a single clustering can adequately describe the patients across all data views, or whether the patients cluster separately in each data view. In Aim 2, the framework will be applied to multi-view network data (e.g. a single set of proteins, with both binary and co-complex interactions measured), in order to determine whether the nodes belong to a single set of communities across the data views, or a separate set of communities in each data view. In Aim 3, the framework will be applied to multi-view multivariate data in order to determine whether the observations can be embedded in a single latent space across all data views, or whether they belong to a separate latent space in each data view. In Aims 1–3, the methods developed will be applied to the Pioneer 100 study, and to the protein interactome. In Aim 4(a), the availability of multiple data views will be used in order to develop a method for tuning parameter selection in unsupervised learning. In Aim 4(b), protein communities that were identiﬁed in Aim 2 will be validated experimentally. High-quality open source software will be developed in Aim 5.  The methods developed in this proposal will be used to determine whether the ﬁndings from multiple data views are the same or different. The application of these methods to multi-view data sets, including the Pioneer 100 study and the protein interactome, will improve our understanding of human health and disease, as well as fundamental biology. Biomedical researchers often collect multiple “types” of data (e.g. clinical data and genetic data) for a single patient, in order to get a fuller picture of that patient's health or disease status than would be possible using any single data type. This proposal involves developing new statistical methods that can be used in order to analyze data sets that consist of multiple data types. Applying these methods will lead to new insights and better understanding of human health and disease.","A Modeling Framework for Multi-View Data, with Applications to the Pioneer 100 Study and Protein Interaction Networks",9962426,R01GM123993,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Set protein', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'multiple data types', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,323659,-0.041246427877158306
"Graspy: A python package for rigorous statistical analysis of populations of attributed connectomes PROJECT SUMMARY Overview: We will extend and develop implementations of foundational methods for analyzing populations of attributed connectomes. Our toolbox will enable brain scientists to (1) infer latent structure from individual connectomes, (2) identify meaningful clusters among populations of connectomes, and (3) detect relationships between connectomes and multivariate phenotypes. The methods we develop and extend will naturally overcome the challenges inherent in connectomics: high-dimensional non-Euclidean data with multi-level nonlinear interactions. Our implementations will comply with the highest open-source standards by: providing extensive online documentation and extended tutorials, hosting workshops to demonstrate our tools on an annual basis, and merging our implementations into commonly used packages such as scikit-learn [1], scipy [2], and networkx [3]. All of the code we develop is open source. We strive to ensure that our code is shared in accordance with the strictest guiding principles. We chose to implement these algorithms in Python due to its wide adoption in the neuroscience and data science fields. In particular, many other neuroscience tools applicable to connectomics, including NetworkX DiPy, mindboggle, nilearn, and nipy, are also implemented in Python. This will enable researchers to chain our analysis tools onto pre-existing pipelines for data preprocessing and visualization. Nonetheless, we feel that sharing our code in our own public repositories is insufficient for global reach. We have also begun reaching out to developers of the leading data science packages in python, including scipy, sklearn, networkx, scikit-image, and DiPy. For each of those packages, we have informal approval to begin integrating algorithms that we have developed. Those packages are collectively used by >220,000 other packages, so merging our algorithms into those packages will significantly extend our global reach. All researchers investigating connectomics, including all the authors of the 24,000 papers that mention the word “connectome”, will be able to apply state-of-the-art statistical theory and methods to their data. Currently, we have about 150 open source software projects on our NeuroData GitHub organization. Collectively, these projects get about 2,000 downloads and >11,000 views per month. As we incorporate additional functionality as described in this proposal, we expect far more researchers across disciplines and sectors will utilize our software. 20 ​ ​​ ​ ​​ Project Narrative Connectomes are an increasingly important modality for characterizing the structure of the brain, to complement behavior, genetics, and physiology. We and others have developed foundational statistical theory and methods over the last decade for the analysis of networks, networks with edge, vertex, and other attributes, and populations thereof, with preliminary implementations of those tools that we leverage in our laboratory for various application papers. In this project, we will extend our package, called graspy, to be of professional quality, implementing key functionality to include (1) estimating latent structure from attributed connectomes, (2) identifying meaningful clusters among populations of connectomes, and (3) detecting relationships between connectomes and multivariate phenotypes, such as behavior, genetics, and physiology. 18",Graspy: A python package for rigorous statistical analysis of populations of attributed connectomes,10012519,RF1MH123233,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Coin', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Neurosciences', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Property', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Study', 'Structure', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'brain research', 'connectome', 'data pipeline', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'high standard', 'open source', 'public repository', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,1246005,-0.003630943159227562
"Multiscale Modeling of Enzymatic Reactions and Firefly Bioluminescence Abstract Enzyme functionality is a critical component of all life systems. Whereas advances in experimental methodology have enabled a better understanding of factors that control enzyme function, critical components of the reaction space such as highly unstable intermediates and transition states are best accessed for evaluation through computational simulations. Similarly, computational methodology continues to provide a key resource for probing excited-state processes such as bioluminescence. Combined ab initio quantum mechanical molecular mechanical (ai-QM/MM) simulations are, in principle, the preferred choice in the modeling of both processes. But ai-QM/MM modeling of enzymatic reactions is now severely limited by its computational cost, where a direct ai-QM/MM free energy simulation of an enzymatic reaction can take 500,000 or more CPU hours. Meanwhile, ai-QM/MM modeling of firefly bioluminescence is also hindered by the computational accuracy, where it has yet to produce quantitatively correct predictions for the bioluminescence spectral shift with site-directed mutagenesis. The goal of this proposal is to accelerate ai-QM/MM simulations of enzymatic reaction free energy and to improve the quality of ai-QM/MM-simulated bioluminescence spectra, so that ai-QM/MM simulations can be routinely performed by experimental groups. This will be achieved via a) using a lower-level (semi-empirical QM/MM) Hamiltonian for sampling; b) an enhancement to the similarity between the two Hamiltonians by calibrating the low-level Hamiltonian using the reaction pathway force matching approach, in conjunction with several other methods. The expected outcomes of this collaborative effort include: a) advanced methodologies for accelerated reaction free energy simulations and accurate bioluminescence spectra predictions, which will be released through multiple software platforms; b) a fundamental understanding of reactions such as Kemp elimination and polymerase-eta catalyzed DNA replication; c) a deeper insight into the role of macromolecular environment in the modulation of enzyme catalytic activities or bioluminescence wavelengths, which can further enhance our capability of designing new enzymes and bioluminescence probes. Narrative This project aims to develop quantum-mechanics-based computational methods to more quickly model enzymatic reactions and more accurately model bioluminescence spectra. It will lead to reliable and efficient computational tools for use by the general scientific community. It will facilitate the probe of enzymatic reaction mechanisms and the computer-aided design of new bioluminescence probes.",Multiscale Modeling of Enzymatic Reactions and Firefly Bioluminescence,10021018,R01GM135392,"['Adopted', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioluminescence', 'Calibration', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Electrostatics', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Fireflies', 'Free Energy', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Ions', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multienzyme Complexes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multi-scale modeling', 'mutant', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2020,255238,-0.010093723923376584
"CRCNS: US-France Data Sharing Proposal: Lowering the barrier of entry to network neuroscience The field of network neuroscience has developed powerful analysis tools for studying brain networks and holds promise for deepening our understanding of the role played by brain networks in health, disease, development, and cognition. Despite widespread interest, barriers exist that prevent these tools from having broader impact. These include (1) unstandardized practices for sharing and documenting software, (2) long delays from when a method is first introduced to when it becomes publicly available, and (3) gaps in theoretic knowledge and understanding leading to incorrect, delays due to mistakes, and errors in reported results. These barriers ultimately slow the rate of neuroscientific discovery and stall progress in applied domains. To overcome these challenges, we will use open science methods and cloud-computing, to increase the availability of network neuroscience tools. We will use the platform ""brainlife.io"" for sharing these tools, which will be packaged into self-contained, standardized, reproducible Apps, shared with and modified by a community of users, and integrated into existing brainlife.io analysis pipelines. Apps will also be accompanied by links to primary sources, in-depth tutorials, and documentation, and worked-through examples, highlighting their correct usage and offering solutions for mitigating possible pitfalls. In standardizing and packaging network neuroscience tools as Apps, this proposed research will engage a new generation of neuroscientists, providing them powerful new and leading to new discoveries. Second, the proposed research will contribute growing suite of modeling analysis that can be modified to suit specialized purposes. Finally, the Brainlife.io platform will serve as part of the infrastructure supporting neuroscience research. Altogether, these advances will lead to new opportunities in network neuroscience research and further stimulate its growth while increasing synergies with other domains in neuroscience. Structural and functional networks support cognitive processes. Miswiring networks lead to maladaptive behavior and neuropsychicatric disorders. Network neuroscience is a young field that provides a quantitative framework for modeling brain networks.

"Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroscience is producing increasingly complex data sets, including measures and manipulations of sub- cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular mechanisms operating over multiple timescales and in the context of different behaviors and task conditions. These data sets pose several fundamental challenges. First, for a given data set, what are the relevant spatial, temporal, and computational scales in which the underlying information-processing dynamics are best understood? Second, what are the best ways to design and select models to account for these dynamics, given the inevitably limited, noisy, and uneven spatial and temporal sampling used to collect the data? Third, what can increasingly complex data sets, collected under increasingly complex conditions, tells us about how the brain itself processes complex information? The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate new, theoretically grounded methods to help researchers to overcome these challenges. Our primary hypothesis is that resolving, modeling, and interpreting relevant information- processing dynamics from complex data sets depends critically on approaches that are built upon understanding the notion of complexity itself. A key insight driving this proposal is that definitions of complexity that come from different fields, and often with different interpretations, in fact have a common mathematical foundation. This common foundation implies that different approaches, from direct analyses of empirical data to model fitting, can extract statistical features related to computational complexity that can be compared directly to each other and interpreted in the context of ideal-observer benchmarks. Starting with this idea, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish a common theoretical foundation for analyzing both data and model complexity; 2) develop practical, complexity-based tools for data analysis and model selection; and 3) establish the usefulness of complexity-based metrics for understanding how the brain processes complex information. Together, these Aims provide new theoretical and practical tools for understanding how the brain integrates information across large temporal and spatial scales, using formal, universal definitions of complexity to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of complex neural and behavioral data sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will establish new, theoretically grounded computational tools to help neuroscience researchers design and analyze studies of brain function.

"University of Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years. A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation. We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region, opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in 2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium; 2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively contribute to the national consortium. The University at Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) is the coordinating center of the Buffalo Translational Consortium, which includes the region's premier research, educational and clinical institutions with influential community partners. The vision of the CTSI is to perform innovative clinical and translational research to reduce health disparities and improve the health of our community and the nation.

"SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF EMAN FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IMAGE PROCESSING EMAN is one of the most well-established and widely used scientific image processing suites targeting the rapidly growing CryoEM/CryoET community worldwide. In turn, the CryoEM and CryoET studies which it enables permit determination of the structures of interacting macromolecules both in-vitro and in-vivo, and are being used to better understand the biochemical processes taking place in cells, to better identify potential drug targets and develop novel diagnostics. With the higher resolutions now possible in this field, direct drug interaction structural studies are now possible, and being used to gain insight into the mode of action of drugs within the cell. Unlike many newer tools in the field, such as Relion, CisTEM and CryoSparc, which focus on specific refinement tasks, EMAN is a versatile, modular suite capable of performing a variety of image processing tasks with hundreds of algorithms supporting virtually all of the standard file formats and mathematical conventions used in the field, as well as other related imaging fields. It provides an ideal platform for prototyping fundamental new algorithm developments, while still able to achieve data-limited resolution in single particle reconstruction. While high resolution single particle refinement has become routine in recent years, thanks largely to the dramatic data quality improvements provided by new detector technology, there remain significant opportunities for improvements in mitigating model bias, efficient use of data, and analysis of complexes with compositional or conformational variability. Some of the most important problems from a biological perspective involve the sort of compositional and conformational variability which remain challenging problems. The field also remains susceptible to problems of initial model bias, which are exacerbated in systems exhibiting structural variability, and as a result many structures are still published with exaggerated resolution claims. The standard protocols used by many in the field typically involve discarding a very large fraction of the raw data (as much as 80-90% in some cases), often based on qualitative assessments, raising questions related to rigor and reproducibility of structural results. In this proposal, we will develop or adapt image processing techniques to help resolve these issues, based on developments or unrealized concepts from mathematics and computer science. CryoEM and CryoET are used to study the structures of interacting biomolecules in the cell at resolutions 100x better than the best possible light microscope. This methodology permits new insights into the biomolecules which underlie disease, can shed light on structural changes in diseased cells and provide direct information on how drugs interact with the molecules they target. This grant develops the software used to turn noisy 2-D electron microscope images into reliable 3-D structures of individual molecules extending to near-atomic resolution.",SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF EMAN FOR ELECTRON MICROSCOPY IMAGE PROCESSING,10021685,R01GM080139,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Exhibits', 'Grant', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Light Microscope', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'artificial neural network', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'case-based', 'computer science', 'data quality', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'detector', 'drug action', 'file format', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'macromolecule', 'mathematical sciences', 'microscopic imaging', 'neural network', 'novel diagnostics', 'particle', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'software development', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,344862,-0.02115351833853741
"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement. Project Narrative Early in life, we must acquire crucial skills like speech by imitating adults, so neurological impairments of imitative learning can be debilitating. This proposal is relevant to human health because it will address how cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry supports juvenile imitative learning in a powerful laboratory model, song learning by zebra finches. Insight from the project's findings may improve our ability to relate CBG circuit biology to behavioral outcomes in normal and disordered juvenile imitative learning.",Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches,9911141,F31HD098772,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Punishment', 'Pupil', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'behavioral outcome', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motor learning', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'role model', 'skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'tutoring', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization', 'zebra finch']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,37429,-0.0840348355163905
"Synthetic Biology: At the Crossroads of Genetic Engineering and Human Therapeutics Abstract Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Synthetic Biology: At the Crossroads of Genetic Engineering and Human Therapeutics, organized by Drs. Jose M. Lora and Timothy K. Lu. The conference will be held in Breckenridge, Colorado from March 29- April 1, 2019. Synthetic Biology tools and principles have matured tremendously over the last decade and have reached extraordinary levels of sophistication, both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. Synthetic biology as a therapeutic modality is starting to enter multiple clinical studies and has the potential to have a significant impact on medicine across a wide range of diseases (e.g., metabolic, immune-mediated, cancer, and neurologic diseases). This Keystone Symposia conference will delve into the field of synthetic biology with a special emphasis on its applications to medicine. While there are conferences that capture synthetic biology in only a few talks mixed in among other various topics, there is a paucity of conferences focused on synthetic biology as drugs to treat disease. However, due to the rapid pace of fundamental scientific advances along with an expanding number of biotechnology companies and emerging clinical studies with synthetic biology at their core, this conference will be highly relevant for a wide audience of scientists both from academia and industry. In addition, other meetings in this field have a highly technology-driven focus on synthetic biology techniques with relatively little attention given to biological and medical context. Ultimately, this Keystone Symposia conference should inspire researchers from diverse backgrounds to discuss synthetic biology via many new angles. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past two decades, tremendous advances have been made in the use of biological parts to engineer systems that can effectively direct living cells for a vast variety of purposes (a.k.a. synthetic biology). Synthetic biology is being used to construct more effective therapies in diseases such as cancer, but there are remaining obstacles to the clinical translation of these therapies.

"Skyline Targeted Proteomics Environment Development on Skyline started in 2008 to fill a critical need for a software tool that enabled targeted proteomics experiments. Since then, Skyline has grown into an entire ecosystem of tools, expanding well beyond targeted proteomics. The Skyline software ecosystem is one of the most widely used software platforms in all of mass spectrometry, supporting thousands of investigators in their research. The synergy between Skyline software development and its vast and thriving user community uniquely generate exciting new opportunities for quantitative mass spectrometry. Skyline has been a key factor in the success and growth of this new field, with Skyline itself becoming one of the most significant software tools in mass spectrometry. Since 2015, we have expanded Skyline software, from just the traditional targeted proteomics experiments that used selected reaction monitoring (SRM) with triple quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometers, to broadly encompass ALL types of quantitative proteomics experiments, including data dependent acquisition (DDA) experiments using MS1 peak areas (aka MS1 filtering), targeted tandem mass spectrometry (aka parallel reaction monitoring or PRM) experiments and data independent acquisition (DIA). As of Oct 2019, Skyline has been installed >97,500 times (117% increase since 2015), has over 14,000 registered users (122% increase since 2015) on its website (http://skyline.ms) and is booted up >9,000 times per week (exceeding 17,500 bootups in a single week). The Skyline project has grown beyond the bounds of a single tool. Currently, there are 14 Skyline external tools (55% increase since 2015) that rely on a formalized framework in Skyline and available through its tool store, with more still in development. The prior grant cycle has greatly expanded a community of users and developers working with a common set of tools to analyze quantitative data from all six major mass spectrometry vendors. Specifically, our proposal has five aims. 1) Improve Skyline’s analysis of DDA data, 2) Improve Skyline’s analysis of DIA data, 3) Expand support of new molecule types within Skyline, 4) Support for new quantitative data types, and 5) Provide continued support and training for the Skyline ecosystem. Mass spectrometry has been a fundamental technology for the analysis diverse molecule types in health and disease. Targeted mass spectrometry measurements offer a promising alternative to immunological based assays that are the standard for quantitative protein measurements in clinical and basic research laboratories.

"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9908105,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,291940,-0.029658114112879646
"Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks to develop a resource for the preservation of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This insect is a foundational model organism for biological research. Over a century of work, an enormous number of fly strains harboring different mutant alleles or transgenic constructs have been generated. However, one limitation of working with flies is that there is as yet no practical method for cryopreservation of Drosophila strains. Conventional methods of vitrifying Drosophila were developed in the early 1990s and were never widely adopted due to the difficulty in performing the protocols. This is a problem from a practical perspective since all these strains need to be individually maintained in continuous culture at substantial cost and labor, and also from a scientific perspective, since in the process of continuous culture mutations can accumulate and contamination can occur, degrading the value of these resources for future experiments. A novel approach for cryopreservation of Drosophila is proposed for this R24 resource center. Isolated embryonic nuclei, rather than intact embryos, will be cryopreserved and then nuclear transplantation via microinjection will be used to create clones derived from the cryopreserved nuclei. This approach avoids the issues associated with the impermeability of embryonic membranes that have prevented the use of conventional cryopreservation approaches that have been used with other organisms. Embryonic nuclei will be cryopreserved using a naturally inspired approach. Diverse biological systems (plants, insects, etc.) survive dehydration, drought, freezing temperatures and other stresses through the use of osmolytes. On an applied level, the proposed investigation has the potential to transform preservation of Drosophila lines by 1) preserving subcellular components (specifically nuclei) as opposed to embryos; and 2) automating much of the workflow. In the long- term, the goal of this resource center is to develop a robust and scalable protocol for cryopreservation of Drosophila, thus reducing the cost and improving the quality of long-term strain maintenance. PROJECT NARRATIVE The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a very important model organism for biomedical research. The goal of this resource center is to develop effective methods of preserving fruit flies in order to lower the costs and improve the quality of stock maintenance. The approach leverages recent scientific advances to develop a new, highly automated approach for preserving fruit flies.",Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster,9935719,R24OD028444,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Asses', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Cryopreservation', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Droughts', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Organism', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cold temperature', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'individual response', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nuclear transfer', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'tool']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R24,2020,599090,-0.010788447123957141
"South Carolina Clinical & Translational Research Institute (SCTR) PROJECT SUMMARY – SCTR INSTITUTE Parent Award UL1-TR001450 Since 2009, the South Carolina Clinical and Translational Research Institute (SCTR) has transformed the research environment across South Carolina (SC) by creating a Learning Health System that supports high- quality clinical and translational research (CTR) and fosters collaboration and innovation. Headquartered at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), SCTR has engaged stakeholders and created statewide partnerships to improve care and address social determinants of health across SC. However, greater than 75% of SC is rural, and all 46 counties contain areas designated as medically underserved, so health disparities remain an issue. Over the next five years, SCTR will strengthen its outreach to these medically underserved areas through collaboration with the Clemson University Health Extension Program and the MUSC Telehealth Center of Excellence. With a focus on implementation and dissemination as well as discovery, we will develop and demonstrate innovative technologies and outreach to improve the health of our stakeholders. We will build on prior successes and introduce innovative approaches to expand CTR across SC through the following aims: Aim 1. Extend and enhance high-quality, innovative, flexible curricula and training experiences for all levels of the CTR workforce, with particular emphasis on enhancing workforce heterogeneity and team science. Aim 2. Engage a diverse group of stakeholders as active partners in CTR to address health care priorities while enhancing the scientific knowledge base about collaboration and engagement. Aim 3. Promote greater inclusion across the full translational spectrum of research by engaging investigators from many disciplines and patient populations from diverse demographic backgrounds and geographic areas. Aim 4.

"Eliminating the human factor from stereotaxic surgeries Project Summary: The main goal of this research project is to develop a new line of new stereotaxic devices for small animal research that outperforms existing devices in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and ease of use. Advancing a tool such as an electrode, injection pipette or optical fiber through a small hole in the cranium, sometimes over long distances, and placing it precisely in a particular brain area, often much less than one millimeter in diameter, is a significant experimental challenge. Any time an investigator misses the target brain area and the experiment fails as a result, a significant amount of work is lost, additional animals get sacrificed, materials are wasted, and the pace of scientific discovery has been slowed. Even in cases when experiments succeed, they can be difficult to reproduce because many research groups rely on their most experienced lab members and their “special touch” to perform these procedures – thereby adding an element of non- quantitativeness to the procedures, effectively making the experiment less reproducible. We propose to develop a novel stereotaxic apparatus which will overcome many of these shortcomings. Our device features a radically different mechanical design which is natively compatible with both traditional and novel in-vivo techniques. We propose to combine computer 3D vision and robotics for automatic and software guided adjustments of the animal's skull. Landmarks are measured with 3D vision, based on structured illumination at a level of accuracy that has not been accomplished by any of the existing devices. This information will guide a robotic platform to position the animal for the experiment. Finally, we propose to develop an open software platform for neuronavigation that will allow investigators to use the platform with any small animal species they desire to use. Brain atlas systems for neuronavigation can either be downloaded from a cloud based site, or produced de-novo by the investigator by preparing a single set of MRI and CT scans from one sample animal. Our device will help make stereotaxic procedures more accurate and less dependent on human input and thereby increase the repeatability of experiments within a laboratory as well as the reproducibility of experiments across laboratories. Narrative: The main goal of this research project is to develop a new line of new stereotaxic devices for small animal research that outperforms existing devices in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and ease of use. These devices will help make stereotaxic procedures less dependent on human input and thereby increase the repeatability of experiments within a laboratory as well as the reproducibility of experiments across laboratories. Most importantly, they will help reduce or eliminate failed experiments due to mistargeted interventions, thereby accelerating the pace of scientific discovery.",Eliminating the human factor from stereotaxic surgeries,10080673,R41NS119079,"['3-Dimensional', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lighting', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Monitor', 'Neuronavigation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Side', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age group', 'base', 'bone', 'bone imaging', 'brain tissue', 'cloud based', 'cost effective', 'cranium', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic strain', 'hexapod', 'in vivo', 'laboratory experience', 'member', 'millimeter', 'novel', 'operation', 'optical fiber', 'programs', 'prototype', 'soft tissue', 'software development', 'tool', 'virtual', 'wasting']",NINDS,POPNEURON LTD.,R41,2020,251960,-0.014186621565899506
"Bridging Statistical Inference and Mechanistic Network Models for HIV/AIDS Network models are used to investigate the spread of HIV/AIDS, but rather than assuming that the members of a population of interest are fully mixed, the network approach enables individual-level specification of contact patterns by considering the structure of connections among the members of the population. By representing individuals as nodes and contacts between pairs of individuals as edges, this network depiction enables identification of individuals who drive the epidemic, allows for accurate assessment of study power in cluster- randomized trials, and makes it possible to evaluate the impact of interventions on the individuals themselves, their partners, and the broader network. There are currently two major mathematical paradigms to the modeling of networks: the statistical approach and the mechanistic approach. In the statistical approach, one specifies a model that states the likelihood of observing a given network, whereas in the mechanistic approach one specifies a set of domain-specific mechanistic rules at the level of individual nodes, the actors in the network, that are used to evolve the network over time. Given that mechanistic models directly model individual-level behaviors – modification of which is the foundation of most prevention measures – they are a natural fit for infectious diseases. Another attractive feature of mechanistic models is their scalability as they can be implemented for networks consisting of thousands or even millions of nodes, making it possible to simulate population-wide implementation of interventions. Lack of statistical methods for calibrating these models to empirical data has however impeded their use in real-world settings, a limitation that stems from the fact that there are typically no closed-form likelihood functions available for these models due the exponential increase in the number of ways, as a function of network size, of arriving at a given observed network. We propose to overcome this gap by advancing inferential and model selection methods for mechanistic network models, and by developing a framework for investigating their similarities with statistical network models. We base our approach on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a family of methods developed specifically for settings where likelihood functions are intractable or unavailable. Our specific aims are the following. Aim 1: To develop a statistically principled framework for estimating parameter values and their uncertainty for mechanistic network models. Aim 2: To develop a statistically principled method for model choice between two competing mechanistic network models and estimating the uncertainty surrounding this choice. Aim 3: To establish a framework for mapping mechanistic network models to statistical models. We also propose to implement these methods in open source software, using a combination of Python and C/C++, to facilitate their dissemination and adoption. We believe that the research proposed here can help harness mechanistic network models – and with that leverage some of the insights developed in the network science community over the past decade and more – to help eradicate this disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network models are used to gain a more precise understanding of human behavioral factors associated with the spread of HIV/AIDS in order to develop more effective interventions to halt the epidemic. There are two main mathematical paradigms for modeling networks, the statistical approach and the mechanistic approach, and given that the latter directly models individual-level behaviors – modification of which is the foundation of most prevention measures – mechanistic models are a natural fit for infectious diseases. Lack of statistical methods for calibrating these models to empirical data has so far impeded their use in real-world settings, and we therefore propose to develop parameter inference and model selection methods for mechanistic network models in order to endow the biomedical community with these powerful tools.",Bridging Statistical Inference and Mechanistic Network Models for HIV/AIDS,9970407,R01AI138901,"['AIDS prevention', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Adoption', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Epidemic', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Prevention Measures', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'SET Domain', 'Science', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'effective intervention', 'high dimensionality', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'network models', 'open source', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'stem', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment strategy']",NIAID,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2020,453846,-0.024413704785112775
"Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (N3C Supplement) PROJECT SUMMARY Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute (Tufts CTSI) is based on the conviction that authentic involvement of the entire spectrum of clinical and translational research (CTR) is critical to fulfilling the promise of biomedical science for meeting the public's needs. This includes not only from translation from bench to bedside (T1 translation), but also, crucially for having health impact, translation into effective clinical practice (T2), care delivery and public health (T3), and health policy (T4). Advances on all of these fronts is increasingly dependent on making effective use of scientific data from multiple domains. The COVID-19 global emergency presents both an immediate challenge and an opportunity to progress on important data sharing aims emphasized by NIH. In response, NCATS and the Centers for Translational Science Award (CTSA) hubs, several HHS agencies, and other partnering organizations have committed to developing a next-generation repository for clinical data related to COVID-19, the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), as a means of accelerating global research into the disease and aiding the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and effective vaccines. The N3C initiative's goal of improving the efficiency and accessibility of analyses with clinical data is consistent with the primary informatics objectives of Tufts CTSI, which am to reduce barriers to the integration of healthcare and research by providing innovative systems, data repositories, and analytical tools, and by enabling greater exchange and collaboration through interoperability, standardization, and resource sharing. In- line with shared objectives, in this supplement we seek to contribute to the N3C initiative as a data provider and thought partner through the following specific aims: (1) continue to play an important role providing tools and resources for N3C's analytics platform; and (2) ensure Tufts CTSI's Informatics Program has sufficient staff and technical resources to continue to provide COVID-specific patient data from our hub to the N3C repository. PROJECT NARRATIVE An integrated, continuously updated data repository and a platform of putting powerful analytics capabilities at the disposal of the scientific community can generate insights into COVID-19 and accelerate the development of effective treatments and vaccines to counter the disease.

"Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers as development of psychiatric disorders supplement Project Summary/Abstract The mandate of the PsychENCODE Data Analysis Core (DAC) includes the development of novel integrative methodologies to construct a coherent interpretational framework for the data emerging from the consortium. The complexity of building such a framework lies in the diversity of experimental assays and their associated confounding factors, as well as in the inherent uncertainty regarding how the various target biological components function together. As a result, any analytical and computational methods would need to capture this high dimensionality of structure in the data. While classical, parallel computation advances at an incredible pace and continues to serve the needs of the research community, our experience with the ever- increasing complexity of neuropsychiatric datasets has motivated us to also look at other promising technological avenues. Accordingly, motivated by recent developments in the field of quantum computing (QC), we herein explore the use of QC algorithms as applied to two problems of relevance to the PsychENCODE DAC: (1) the prediction of brain-specific enhancers based on variants and functional genomic assays (Aim S1; related to Aim 1 of the parent grant); and (2) the calculation of the contributions of cell types to tissue-level gene expression and to the occurrence of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder (Aim S2; related to Aim 1 of the parent grant). The nascency of QC hardware technologies and the complexity of simulating quantum algorithms on classical computing resources means that our exploration will be confined to smaller, judiciously chosen datasets.Nevertheless, the work in this supplement will serve to evaluate future prospects for the use of QC algorithms and hardware in genomic analyses. We also consider two different paradigms of QC, the quantum annealer and the quantum gate model, and weigh their efficiency relative to classical computing. Finally, we will incorporate the QC and classical predictions into PsychENCODE consortium's database and online portal for visualizing the relationships between different genetic and genomic elements, and evaluate corroborating evidence for the predictions (Aim S3; related to Aim 2 of the parent grant). Project Narrative The PsychENCODE consortium has conducted extensive functional genomic analyses of samples from individuals diagnosed with psychiatric disorders aim to discover the complex biological architecture that lead from genetic and epigenetic markers of disease to the observed phenotypes. To reveal this underlying structure, the consortium relies on the use of sophisticated computational methods, including machine learning techniques, implemented on cutting-edge massively parallel computing resources by the consrtium’s Data Analysis Core (DAC). However, the scale and complexity of the tasks place significant burdens on these resources, and suggest the need for exploring alternative computing hardware technologies. This supplement to the DAC parent grant evaluates the promise of the emerging field of quantum computing to speed up large-scale computations and more efficiently explore the model landscape, using a comparative analysis of classical and quantum computing algorithms applied to problems relevant to the PsychENCODE DAC: the annotation of brain-specific enhancers and the quantification of cell-type contributions to bulk tissue gene expression.",Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers as development of psychiatric disorders supplement,10047746,U01MH116492,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computing resources', 'data framework', 'design', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'high dimensionality', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'parallel computer', 'parent grant', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'quantum computing', 'simulation', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2020,195697,-0.025107944901299774

"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point.

"Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Researchers are increasingly working to “mine” health data to derive new medical knowledge. Unlike experimental data that are collected per a research protocol, the primary role of clinical data is to help clinicians care for patients, so the procedures for its collection are not often systematic. Thus, missing and/or biased data can hinder medical knowledge discovery and data mining efforts. Existing efforts for missing health data imputation often focus on only cross-sectional correlation (e.g., correlation across subjects or across variables) but neglect autocorrelation (e.g., correlation across time points). Moreover, they often focus on modeling incompleteness but neglect the biases in health data. Modeling both the incompleteness and bias may contribute to better understanding of health data and better support clinical decision making. We propose a novel framework of Bias-Aware Missing data Imputation with Cross-sectional correlation and Autocorrelation (BAMICA), and leverage clinical notes to better inform the methods that will otherwise rely on structured health data only. In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets. Aim 1 introduces the MICA framework to jointly consider cross-sectional correlation and auto-correlation. In Aim 2, we will augment MICA to be bias-aware (hence BAMICA) to account for biases stemmed from multiple roots such as healthcare process and use them as features in imputing missing health data. This augmentation is achieved by a novel recurrent neural network architecture that keeps track of both evolution of health data variables and bias factors. In Aim 3, we will supplement unstructured clinical notes to structured health data for modeling incompleteness and biases using a novel architecture of graph neural network on top of memory network. We will apply graph neural networks to process clinical notes in order to learn proper representations as input to the memory networks for imputation and downstream predictive modeling tasks. Depending on the clinical problem and data availability, not all modules may be needed. Thus our proposed BAMICA framework is designed to be flexible and consists of selectable modules to meet some or all of the above needs. In summary, our proposal bridges a key knowledge gap in jointly modeling incompleteness and biases in health data and utilizes unstructured clinical notes to supplement and augment such modeling in order to better support predictive modeling and clinical decision making. We will demonstrate generalizability by experimenting on four large clinical and cohort study datasets, and by scaling up to the eMERGE network spanning 11 institutions nationwide. We will disseminate the open-source framework. The principled and flexible framework generated by this project will bring significant methodological advancement and have a direct impact on enhancing discovery from health data.

Detailed genetic and environmental characterization of diseases and conditions relies on the large-scale mining of functional genomics data; hence, there is great desire to share data as broadly as possible. However, there is a scarcity of privacy studies focused on such data. A key first step in reducing private information leakage is to measure the amount of information leakage in functional genomics data, particularly in different data file types. To this end, we propose to to derive information-theoretic measures for private information leakage in different data types from functional genomics data. We will also develop various file formats to reduce this leakage during sharing. We will approach the privacy analysis under three aims. First, we will develop statistical metrics that can be used to quantify the sensitive information leakage from raw reads. We will systematically analyze how linking attacks can be instantiated using various genotyping methods such as single nucleotide variant and structural variant calling from raw reads, signal profiles, Hi-C interaction matrices, and gene expression matrices. Second, we will study different algorithms to implement privacy-preserving transformations to the functional genomics data in various forms. Particularly, we will create privacy-preserving file formats for raw sequence alignment maps, signal track files, three-dimensional interaction matrices, and gene expression quantification matrices that contain information from multiple individuals. This will allow us to study the sources of sensitive information leakages other than raw reads, for example signal profiles, splicing and isoform transcription, and abnormal three-dimensional genomic interactions. Third, we will investigate the reads that can be mapped to the microbiome in the raw human functional genomics datasets. We will use inferred microbial information to characterize private information about individuals, and then combine the microbial information with the information from human mapped reads to increase the re-identification accuracy in the linking attacks described in the second aim. We will use the tools to quantify the sensitive information and privacy-preserving file formats in the available datasets from large sequencing projects, such as the ENCODE, The Cancer Genome Atlas, 1,000 Genomes, gEUVADIS, and Genotype-Tissue Expression projects. Project Narrative: Sharing large-scale functional genomics data is critical for scientific discovery, but comes with important privacy concerns related to the possible misuse of such data. This proposal will quantify and manage the rieslkasted to releasing functional genomics datasets, based on integrating inferred genotypes from the raw sequence files, signal tracks, and microbiome mapped sequences. Finally, we will develop file formats, statistical methodologies, and related software for anonymization of functional genomics data that enable open sharing.",Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation,9970939,R01HG010749,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Glean', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Motivation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoker', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'human tissue', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'open data', 'privacy preservation', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,523409,-0.034612096337021565
"WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES NETWORK CLINICAL SITE 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure.

"Accurate prediction of neutralization capacity from deep mining of SARS-CoV-2 serology ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to establish an accurate and sensitive method for predicting the neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 of serum samples by deep mining of antibody profiles. The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global threat with nearly seven million cases and 400K deaths. In the absence of effective vaccines and therapeutics, immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is a main mechanism of protection against SARS-CoV-2 (re)infection. Our recent studies of convalescent serum samples revealed that their levels of neutralization capacity vary greatly (over 100-fold) and only a small subset has high neutralization capacity. Because viral neutralization assays are inherently low throughput, it is unrealistic to apply it to a high-risk population such as hospital workers in a timely manner. Unfortunately, there is only moderate correlation between the neutralization capacity and the level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels determined using standard ELISA. Clearly, we still do not understand what types of antibodies contribute to viral neutralization. Our overarching hypothesis to be tested in this project is that by examining the antibody profile in patient serum more deeply and quantitatively in terms of antigens, epitopes and antibody types, we will be able to identify quantitative predictive markers for viral neutralization. To this end, we will develop multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 serology that will enable us to deeply characterize the antibody profile. We will then develop a predictive algorithm by utilizing. We have assembled a team of experts with truly complementary skills in antibody characterization, virology and data mining. We have access to a large number of convalescent serum samples, which will enable us to critically validate our technology. We will expeditiously execute the following aims. (1) We will develop multiplex serology assay for SARS-CoV-2 that can profile up to 15 antibody-antigen interactions in a single reaction. The main technical innovation is the introduction of multi-dimensional flow cytometry. We will produce multiple antigens including Spike, receptor-binding domain and nucleocapsid protein, and their natural and designed variants. We will refine and validate the assay using a large panel of convalescent serum samples. (2) We will develop an improved viral neutralization assay to better quantify the neutralization capacity. (3) We will develop a predictive algorithm for neutralization capacity that utilizes the antibody profiles from our multiplex assay. This analysis will identify serology parameters that contribute to neutralization. The end products of this project will include a high-throughput serology assay that gives far- richer antibody profiles than the current standard accompanied with an accurate predictive algorithm. Together, this platform will help advance a fundamental understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the development of vaccines and therapeutics against this formidable pathogen. PROJECT NARRATIVE The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood samples of people exposed to the virus vary greatly, and current antibody testing methods do not accurately determine the level of neutralizing antibodies. This project will develop innovative platform for deep mining of antibody profiles from a small amount of blood samples and accurately predict their neutralization capacity.

"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of “non-monotone” missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ﬂawed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ﬁxed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiﬁc domains, making “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiﬁc reporting. Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Narrative We will develop, implement and disseminate an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software tool to evaluate the robustness to missing data assumptions of clinical trials in which binary outcomes are collected at ﬁxed points over time but where participants intermittently miss their scheduled assess- ments, as frequently occurs in addiction research. We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiﬁc reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9923614,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical trial analysis', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,100287,-0.008997391547867642
"Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs PROJECT ABSTRACT Above-knee amputees often struggle to perform the varying activities of daily life with conventional prostheses. Emerging powered knee-ankle prostheses have motors that can restore normative biomechanics, but these devices are limited to a small set of pre-defined activities that must be tuned to the user by technical experts over several hours. The overall goal of this project is to model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning. The universal use of different task-specific controllers in current powered legs is a direct consequence of the prevailing paradigm for viewing human locomotion as a discrete set of activities. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge about how to analyze, model, and control continuously varying locomotion, which greatly limits the adaptability and agility of powered prostheses. The central hypothesis of this project is that continuously varying activities can be represented by a single mathematical model based on measureable physical quantities called task variables. The proposed project will be scientifically significant to understanding how humans continuously adapt to varying activities and environments, technologically significant to the design of agile, user-synchronized powered prosthetic legs, and clinically significant to the adoption of powered knee-ankle prostheses for improved community ambulation. The proposed model of human locomotion will enable new prosthetic strategies for controlling and adapting to the environment, which aligns with the missions of the NICHD/NCMRR Devices and Technology Development program area and the NIBIB Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program. The innovation of this work is encompassed in 1) a continuous paradigm for variable locomotor activities that challenges the existing discrete paradigm, 2) a unified task control methodology that drastically improves the agility of powered prosthetic legs, and 3) a partially automated tuning process that significantly reduces the time and technical expertise required to configure powered knee- ankle prostheses. This continuous task paradigm will provide new methods and models for studying human locomotion across tasks and task transitions. This innovation will address a key roadblock in control technology that currently restricts powered legs to a small set of activities that do not generalize well across users. The adaptability of the proposed control paradigm across users and activities will transform the prosthetics field with a new generation of “plug-and-play” powered legs for community ambulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the clinical application of variable-activity powered prosthetic legs can significantly improve community mobility and therefore quality of life for nearly a million American amputees. Recently developed powered knee-ankle prostheses are limited to a small set of pre- defined activities that require several hours of expert tuning for each user. This project will model and control human locomotion over continuously varying tasks for the design of agile, powered prostheses that require little to no tuning, which aligns with the missions of the Devices and Technology Development program area of the NICHD National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research and the Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis program of the NIBIB.",Controlling Locomotion over Continuously Varying Activities for Agile Powered Prosthetic Legs,9925236,R01HD094772,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'American', 'Amputees', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Artificial Leg', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Degree program', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Environment', 'Gait', 'Gait speed', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Locomotion', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematical Model Simulation', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prosthesis', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Study models', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'human data', 'human model', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'powered prosthesis', 'programs', 'prosthesis control', 'rehabilitation research', 'robot control', 'sensor', 'success', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'trend']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,446707,-0.013251873014032498
"Big Flow Cytometry Data: Data Standards, Integration and Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Flow cytometry is a single-cell measurement technology that is data-rich and plays a critical role in basic research and clinical diagnostics. The volume and dimensionality of data sets currently produced with modern instrumentation is orders of magnitude greater than in the past. Automated analysis methods in the field have made great progress in the past five years. The tools are available to perform automated cell population identification, but the infrastructure, methods and data standards do not yet exist to integrate and compare non-standardized big flow cytometry data sets available in public repositories. This proposal will develop the data standards, software infrastructure and computational methods to enable researchers to leverage the large amount of public cytometry data in order to integrate, re-analyze, and draw novel biological insights from these data sets. The impact of this project will be to provide researchers with tools that can be used to bridge the gap between inference from isolated single experiments or studies, to insights drawn from large data sets from cross-study analysis and multi-center trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE The aims of this project are to develop standards, software and methods for integrating and analyzing big and diverse flow cytometry data sets. The project will enable users of cytometry to directly compare diverse and non-standardized cytometry data to each other and make biological inferences about them.

"Computational Methods for Enhancing Privacy in Biomedical Data Sharing Project Summary Data sharing is essential to modern biomedical data science. Access to a large amount of genomic and clinical data can help us better understand human genetics and its impact on health and disease. However, the sensitive nature of biomedical information presents a key bottleneck in data sharing and collection efforts, limiting the utility of these data for science. The goal of this project is to leverage cutting-edge advances in cryptography and information theory to develop innovative computational frameworks for privacy-preserving sharing and analysis of biomedical data. We will draw upon our recent success in developing secure pipelines for collaborative biomedical analyses to address the imminent need to share sensitive data securely and at scale.  Practical adoption of existing privacy-preserving techniques in biomedicine has thus far been largely limited due to two major pitfalls, which this project overcomes with novel technical advances. First, emerging cryptographic data sharing frameworks, which promise to enable collaborative analysis pipelines that securely combine data across multiple institutions with theoretical privacy guarantees, are too costly to support complex and large-scale computations required in biomedical analyses. In this project, we will build upon recent advances in cryptography (e.g., secure distributed computation, pseudorandom correlation, zero-knowledge proofs) to significantly enhance the scalability and security of cryptographic biomedical data sharing pipelines. Second, existing approaches that locally transform data to protect sensitive information before sharing (e.g. de-identification techniques) either offer insufficient levels of protection or require excessive perturbation in order to ensure privacy. We will draw upon recent tools from information theory to develop effective local privacy protection methods that achieve superior utility-privacy tradeoffs on a range of biomedical data including genomes, transcriptomes, and medical images by directly exploiting the latent correlation structure of the data.  To promote the use of our privacy techniques, we will create production-grade software of our tools and publicly release them. We will also actively participate in international standard-setting organizations in genomics, e.g. GA4GH and ICDA, to incorporate our insights into community guidelines for biomedical privacy. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods and software tools that open the door to secure sharing and analysis of massive sets of sensitive genomic and clinical data. Our long-term goal is to broadly enable data sharing and collaboration efforts in biomedicine, thus empowering researchers to better understand the molecular basis of human health and to drive translation of new biological insights to the clinic. Project Narrative Rapidly-growing volume of biomedical datasets around the world promises to enable unprecedented insights into human health and disease. However, increasing concerns for individual privacy severely limited the extent of data sharing in the field. This project draws upon cutting-edge tools from cryptography and information theory to develop effective privacy- preserving methods for collecting, sharing, and analyzing sensitive biomedical data to empower advances in genomics and medicine.",Computational Methods for Enhancing Privacy in Biomedical Data Sharing,10017554,DP5OD029574,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Policies', 'Polynomial Models', 'Preservation Technique', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cryptography', 'data sharing', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'privacy preservation', 'privacy protection', 'software development', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'success', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",OD,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",DP5,2020,392799,-0.021566261386260676
"Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training 2.0 (AR3T 2.0) OVERALL: ABSTRACT  The scope of regenerative medicine encompasses the repair, regeneration, and replacement of defective, injured, and diseased tissues and organs. The success of regenerative therapies is dependent, at least in part, on a favorable microenvironment in which the regenerative processes occur. Technological innovations and a deepened mechanistic understanding of how these microenvironmental signals influence tissue regeneration has drawn attention to the critical importance of the clinical field with foundations in the application of physical, thermal, and electrical stimuli to promote functional restoration—rehabilitation. We propose that the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitative science are inextricably intertwined, an intersection of disciplines that we and others have termed Regenerative Rehabilitation. To realize the full potential of Regenerative Rehabilitation, there is a need for formalized mechanisms that promote the interaction of basic scientists with rehabilitation specialists. During the initial funding cycle, the Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training (AR3T) built a national network of investigators and programs that has helped to expand scientific knowledge, expertise and methodologies across the domains of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation. This proposal seeks funding for AR3T 2.0, in which we will build on successes achieved and lessons learned over the initial period of support with the goal of being even more responsive to the needs of the greater community. Six specific aims define a framework upon which we will achieve our goals. AR3T will provide education and drive the science underlying Regenerative Rehabilitation by: 1) Providing didactic programs that expose rehabilitation researchers to cutting-edge investigations and state-of-the-art technologies in the field of regenerative medicine (Didactic Aim); 2) Cultivating collaborative opportunities between renowned investigators in the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation (Collaborations Aim); 3) Coordinating a pilot funding program to support novel lines of Regenerative Rehabilitation research (Pilot Funding Aim); 4) Developing and validating technologies to advance the measurement and use of the regenerative rehabilitation programs (Technology Aim); 5) Promoting our center’s expertise to a broad community of trainees, investigators, and clinicians (Promotion Aim); 6) Carefully monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our program will ensure that we are successful in achieving our goals (Quality Control Aim). Administrative note: In the preparation of this proposal, we made every effort to present a comprehensive and detailed plan for achieving our goals while minimizing redundancy. Therefore, in multiple places, we refer the reader to specific components of the application, rather than repeating text. We appreciate the time and effort the reviewers devote to the evaluation of the proposals.  Sincerely, Fabrisia, Tom and Mike PROJECT NARRATIVE  Regenerative Rehabilitation is the integration of principles and approaches across the fields of rehabilitation science and regenerative medicine. The integration of these two fields will increase the efficiency of interventions designed to optimize physical functioning to the benefit of a wide range of individuals with disabilities. The Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training (AR3T) 2.0 will build on the momentum gained over the first cycle of funding with the goal of continuing to illuminate and seize opportunities to expand scientific knowledge, expertise and methodologies in the domain of Regenerative Rehabilitation.",Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training 2.0 (AR3T 2.0),9967689,P2CHD086843,"['Accountability', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Country', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'In Vitro', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Physical Function', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Reader', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'career', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'falls', 'functional restoration', 'gait examination', 'healing', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'investigator training', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'regenerative', 'regenerative therapy', 'rehabilitation research', 'rehabilitation science', 'repaired', 'response', 'sabbatical', 'social media', 'success', 'symposium', 'technological innovation', 'therapy design', 'tissue regeneration', 'webinar']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,P2C,2020,1059198,-0.023984949167719403
"The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease Most investigations of craniosynostosis focus on the dermatocranium, the second cranial skeleton to form during embryogenesis that comprises the dermal bones of the cranial vault and facial skeleton. A completely separate cranial skeleton, the chondrocranium, develops before the dermatocranium to support the embryonic brain and other sense organs. Historically, the chondrocranium has been studied across the vertebrates and is recognized as fundamental to craniofacial development, but it is not well known to craniofacial biologists and has never been studied in the laboratory mouse until now. The chondrocranium is formed of cartilage and though parts of it ossify endochondrally, other portions begin to degenerate by about embryonic day 15-16 in the mouse. By careful analysis of whole mount and histological specimens, we have documented the synchronized deterioration of select chondrocranial elements with the appearance and superimposition of particular dermal bones of the growing dermatocranium. These observations signal the existence of a mechanism for the coordinated, localized expansion (dermal bones) and resorption (cartilage) of two developmentally and evolutionarily separate skeletal systems. Our project, supported by strong preliminary data of the mouse chondrocranium, is designed to test a central hypothesis: that the chondrocranium serves as a structural and functional scaffold for the later development of dermatocranial elements including the formation of cranial vault sutures. Based on the common finding that boundaries between different cell populations often serve as tissue organizers, we recognize the establishment and maintenance of stable boundaries that restrict the mixing of different cell populations as critical to proper development, and propose a research design that interrogates the chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundary as significant to the coordinated development of the skull. We will interrogate cells at specific sites to determine the processes that function to maintain the boundaries. Then using the Fgfr2c+/C342Y mouse model for craniosynostosis, we will investigate relevant chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundaries operative in the development of two craniosynostosis phenotypes: premature closure of the coronal suture and abnormal growth of the midface. That the chondrocranium is composed of irregularly shaped cartilages, many of which are short-lived, requires that we conceive new tools for analysis. We will complete development of an innovative system to dissect and reconstruct the chondrocranium in silico from micro computed tomography images with tight temporal control, precisely delineate chondrocranial anatomy in 3D over embryonic time, and establish the role of the chondrocranium in development of the dermatocranium. Achieving our goals will enrich textbook knowledge of craniofacial development by defining the role of the chondrocranium in the production of dermatocranial phenotypes, provide information relative to the pathophysiology of countless craniofacial anomalies, and reveal potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutics. Craniofacial anomalies are common birth defects that require comprehensive, sometimes repetitive corrective surgeries to manage individual cases. To ameliorate the financial and emotional burden on patients and their families, efforts are aimed at the development of preventative therapies but these require a thorough understanding of craniofacial development. We offer novel information about the chondrocranium, the first embryonic cranial skeleton to develop, and focus on mechanisms operating within boundaries between it and the dermatocranium that are critical to craniofacial development, in normal individuals and in craniofacial disease.",The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease,9847792,R01DE027677,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Apert-Crouzon syndrome', 'Apoptosis', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Birth', 'Bone Resorption', 'Brain', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Chondrichthyes', 'Chondrocranium', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Embryonic Structures', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory mice', 'Live Birth', 'Maintenance', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Osteoblasts', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sense Organs', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal system', 'Skeleton', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'bone', 'cleft lip and palate', 'coronal suture', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fibroblast growth factor receptor 2c', 'histological specimens', 'imaging Segmentation', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'microCT', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'osteogenic', 'premature', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIDCR,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2020,523782,-0.0352241193062904

"Privacy-preserving genomic medicine at scale 1 Project Summary  2  3 High-throughput sequencing, biomedical imaging, and electronic health record technologies are 4 generating health-related datasets of unprecedented scale. Integrative analysis of these  5 resources promises to reveal new biology and drive personal and precision medicine. Yet, the  6 sensitive nature of these data often requires that they be kept in isolated silos, limiting their 7 usefulness to science. The goal of this project is to develop innovative privacy-preserving  8 algorithms to enable data sharing and drive genomic medicine. Crucially, we will draw upon our  9 past success in secure genome analysis and algorithmic expertise in computational biology to 10 address the imminent need to perform complex integrative analyses securely and at scale. 11 Current privacy-preserving tools are prohibitively too costly to perform the complex 12 calculations required in genomic analysis. We previously leveraged the highly structured nature 13 of biological data and novel optimization strategies to implement efficient pipelines for secure 14 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and drug interaction predictions which scaled to 15 millions of samples. In this project, we will further exploit the unique properties of biomedical data 16 to: (i) develop secure integrative analysis methods for genomic medicine; (ii) develop an easy-to- 17 use programming environment with advanced automated optimizations to facilitate the adoption 18 of privacy-preserving analyses; and (iii) promote the use of our privacy techniques to gain novel 19 biological insights through large-scale collaborative genetic studies of multi-ethnic cohorts. 20 With co-I’s Amarasinghe (MIT) and Cho (Broad Institute), we aim to apply these tools to 21 realize the first multi-institution, multi-national secure genetic studies with our partners at the 22 Swiss Personalized Health Network, UK Biobank, Finnish FinnGen, All of Us, NIH NCBI, Broad 23 and Barcelona Supercomputing Center (Letters of Support). We will also use our privacy- 24 preserving approaches to study genomic origins of polygenic traits for disease as well as 25 neuroimaging and other clinical phenotypes. We will continue to actively integrate our methods 26 into community standards (MPEG-G, GA4GH). 27 Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods and open-source, 28 easy-to-use, production-grade implementations that open the door to secure integration and 29 analysis of massive sets of sensitive genomic and clinical data. With input from our collaborations, 30 we will build these tools and apply them to better understand the molecular causes of human 31 health and its translation to the clinic. Project Narrative Combining genomic and health-related data from millions of patients will empower the development of clinically relevant measures of human health and disease risks. However, this task requires securely sharing sensitive data at an immense scale beyond what existing cryptographic platforms can achieve.

"Multiscale Analyses of 4D Nucleome Structure and Function by Comprehensive Multimodal Data Integration PROJECT SUMMARY The cell nucleus is a heterogeneous organelle that consists of nuclear bodies such as nuclear lamina, speckles, nucleoli and PML bodies. These structures continuously tether and tug chromatin at the small and large scales to synergistically orchestrate dynamic functions in distinct spatio-temporal compartments. A major obstacle to the production of navigable 4D reference maps and relating structure to function in the nucleus remains understanding how these different scales of organization influence each other. In particular, we have a poor understanding of the large-scale genome organization. Growing evidence suggests that such nuclear compartmentalization is causally connected with vital genome functions in human health and disease. However, the principles of this nuclear compartmentalization, its dynamics during changes in cell conditions, and its functional relevance are poorly understood. One lesson from Phase 1 4DN was the huge gap in throughput between imaging methods, that directly measure large-scale multi-landmark relationships, and genomic methods, that aim for whole genome high-resolution maps but are indirect measurements and provide limited information about large-scale compartments. For this 4DN UM1 Center application, we propose to meet these needs through the following Aims: (1) Generate multi-modal imaging and genomic datasets to reveal the structure, dynamics, and function of nuclear compartmentalization; (2) Develop and apply computational tools for data-driven genome structure modeling and integrative analysis of nuclear compartmentalization; (3) Develop an integrative analysis and visualization platform with navigable 4D reference maps of nuclear organization. The combined datasets and results of our proposed approaches will advance our understanding of nuclear compartmentalization, the interwoven connections among different nuclear components, and their functional significance. Our new integrative analysis tools and data-driven predictive models will produce more complete nuclear organization reference maps that integrate large-scale chromosome structure data from live and super-resolution microscopy with multi-modal genomic data including smaller scale chromatin interaction maps and predict functional relationships and dynamic responses. Our navigable reference maps will be publicly accessible through an analysis platform that provides interactive visualization of multiple data types, thus enabling investigators with diverse expertise to simultaneously explore their own data and related datasets/tools and promoting collaborations that will open new horizons into the role of the 4D nucleome in human health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will enhance our understanding of nuclear genome organization and functions that are increasingly being linked to health and disease. Because we develop tools to disseminate this information and enable others to work with our data and their own data, we will also bring nuclear architecture to bear on a broad range of ongoing health related research. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH’s mission that seeks to obtain fundamental knowledge that will help to improve human health.",Multiscale Analyses of 4D Nucleome Structure and Function by Comprehensive Multimodal Data Integration,10156141,UM1HG011593,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytology', 'DNA Replication Timing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Interphase Chromosome', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cell cycle genetics', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'data exploration', 'data integration', 'data tools', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental function', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'multiscale data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'structured data', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,UM1,2020,2075409,-0.02388505079145406
"Development of a web-based platform implementing novel Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices (PreSS/MD) PROJECT SUMMARY Medical devices have been documented to contain toxic chemicals that can leach and cause acute contact dermatitis (ACD) after repeated exposure or prolonged contact of the skin to these toxins. ACD is credited for 10-15% of all occupational illnesses and is also the second highest reported occupational hazard. Given its prevalence, ACD is also a great public health burden with combined yearly costs of up to $1 billion, which spans including medical costs, worker’s compensation and lost working time due to workplace absence. To this end, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has mandated that all medical devices must be evaluated for possible skin sensitization using in vivo animal assays, which includes the Guinea pig maximization test (GPMT). Although GPMT tests provide valuable data on the skin sensitization effects of potential toxins, these assays are time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) recently published a Strategic Roadmap, calling for the development of alternative approaches to reduce animal testing of chemical and medical agents. Thus, there is a stated need to modernize safety evaluation of medical devices to reduce animal testing and shorten the regulatory review time, which would ultimately bring safer devices to the market faster. To address this unmet need, the key objectives of our FDA Phase I SBIR project are to (i) produce rigorously validated computational models for the GPMT assay integrating data obtained in human, mouse, and in vitro assays; and (ii) integrate these models into a software product termed PreSS/MD (Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices). Our specific aims for this study include: 1) collecting, curating, and integrating the largest publicly available dataset for GMPT; 2) creating and validating novel computational models for GMPT data; 3) developing the PreSS/MD web server to allow users to make predictions of skin sensitization potential in medical devices. We will also develop a model for mixtures, including compounds tested jointly in different concentrations, using an approach that we developed previously. Finally, we will implement novel approaches to help users of our PreSS/MD platform interpret the developed models in terms of key chemical features responsible for skin sensitization. In addition, we will employ biomedical knowledge graphs to elucidate Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) for skin sensitizers. Successful execution of this Phase I project will yield in the development of PreSS/MD as a centralized resource to evaluate the skin sensitization potential for medical devices. We expect this software-as-a-service web server platform will be of great value for companies and sponsors seeking regulatory approval of medical devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given that medical devices have been documented to contain toxic chemicals that may lead to allergic contact dermatitis, the US Food and Drug Administration requires that all devices be evaluated for possible skin sensitization effects using in vivo assays such as the Guinea pig maximization test. In the effort to modernize skin sensitization safety evaluation methods to reduce in vivo animal testing, herein we propose to develop a software product, PreSS/-MD (Predictor of Skin Sensitization caused by Medical Devices), as an innovative and unique in silico alternative with the potential to better predict human response compared to the existing approaches for skin sensitization assessment. Successful execution of the objectives described in this project will result in a centralized web server platform to evaluate the skin sensitization potential for medical devices, which will be of significant value for companies and sponsors seeking regulatory approval of medical devices.",Development of a web-based platform implementing novel Predictor of Skin Sensitization for Medical Devices (PreSS/MD),10079701,R43ES032371,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Allergic Contact Dermatitis', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Assay', 'Cavia', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Contact Dermatitis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Instruction', 'Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Occupational', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Poison', 'Prevalence', 'Prostheses and Implants', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxin', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Workers&apos', ' Compensation', 'Workplace', 'adverse outcome', 'chemical release', 'cost', 'experience', 'in silico', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'knowledge graph', 'lymph nodes', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'occupational hazard', 'operation', 'phase 1 study', 'response', 'skin patch', 'software as a service', 'success', 'systemic toxicity', 'tool', 'web portal', 'web server']",NIEHS,"PREDICTIVE, LLC",R43,2020,167910,-0.013877467618364812
"A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing Project Summary: Neurotoxicological evaluation of new compounds intended for human use or of potential human exposure is mandated by international regulatory bodies and largely relies on lethality testing in higher-order vertebrate animals. High screening costs, long experimental times, and legislative requirements to reduce dependence on animal testing have led many industries to search for alternative technologies. In vitro toxicology testing uses isolated cells or monotypic cell culture and can only provide limited insight since these models lack biologically relevant intact multi-typic cellular network structures. While both technologies have been augmented by in silico technologies, there is still a non-trivial gap between what can be learned and translated from simple, fast, inexpensive in vitro methods versus longer, complex, and costly in vivo studies in higher order animals. Newormics’ approach to filling this gap is to enable in vivo neurotoxicological assessment in Caenorhabditis elegans, an accepted alternative invertebrate model organism, by developing neuron-specific toxicity assays, delivered via a proprietary high-density, large-scale microfluidic immobilization device for high-content, high throughput analysis. Building on advances made during Phase I and important market learnings from participation in the NIH I-Corps program, Phase II proposes several new elements of innovation to achieve our goals in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will convert our first-generation microfluidic device to a high-density (384- well) vivoChip with improved microfabrication technologies, incorporate on-chip culture for transfer-less exposure and testing, and integrate automation for chip loading, imaging, and analysis. These measures will significantly increase test scale (from 80 compounds per chip to 280) and lower the consumable and labor costs per test. In Aim 2, building on our dopaminergic neurotox assay from Phase I, we will develop four neurotox assays with brightly fluorescently labeled dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons providing the unprecedented ability to assess subtle phenotypic effects of chemicals on individual intact, functional neurons. To achieve real-time image processing, multi-parameter phenotyping, and managing the terabytes of image data generated per test, we will build a computational platform empowered by a graphic user interface. This platform will be used for image compilation, user-annotated phenotype definition and scoring, and automated report generation with appropriate statistical analysis. In Aim 3, with our industry partners, we will validate our platform and assays using reference chemicals. As more chemicals are tested, we will build a database which can be further mined. The outcome of this work will enable many industries to reduce lethal animal testing and get safer industrial and personal consumer products to market faster for economic benefit, reaching regulatory compliance for reduced animal use, and improved healthcare for neurological diseases. Narrative: The proposed work will enable the use of a small invertebrate model organism, C. elegans, for neuron-specific analysis of neurodegeneration phenotypes from high-resolution fluorescence images of individual neurons at high throughputs. The proposed imaging system and the neuron-specific assays will provide an unprecedented ability to assess developmental neurotoxicity in an intact, live, whole organism, down to a neuronal mechanism- of-action level. This project will fill the gap between in vitro and in vivo toxicology testing with an effective invertebrate model organism as alternate to vertebrate animal testing.",A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing,10082215,R44MH118841,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dendrites', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dopamine', 'Eating', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gel', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immobilization', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Innovation Corps', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Market Research', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research Activity', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Serotonin', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'cholinergic neuron', 'computational platform', 'connectome', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'density', 'design', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'developmental toxicity', 'empowered', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'fluorescence imaging', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'graphical user interface', 'high resolution imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image processing', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotoxicity', 'neurotoxicology', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'reproductive toxicity', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'terabyte', 'testing services', 'young adult']",NIMH,"NEWORMICS, LLC",R44,2020,749858,-0.01519879966723919
