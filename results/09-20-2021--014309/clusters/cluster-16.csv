"Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease ABSTRACT The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Elsie Ross, Assistant Professor of Surgery (Vascular Surgery) and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics Research) at Stanford University, the support necessary to transition her from a junior investigator into an independent surgeon-scientist in translational biomedical informatics. Dr. Ross is a vascular surgeon with an advanced degree in health services research and postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics. Her long-term goal is to combine her interdisciplinary training to develop and implement machine learning tools that will enable the delivery of precise, high-value care to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Her career development activities focus on advancing her ability to translate informatics discoveries into viable clinical tools by 1) completing didactic courses to deepen and expand her knowledge of deep learning algorithms, clinical trials and implementation science, 2) designing and conducting her first independent human subjects clinical research study evaluating the performance of machine learning technology, 3) implementing and evaluating the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based screening tool to identify latent vascular disease, and 4) strengthening her previous training in cost-effectiveness analysis to enable her future aim of evaluating the associated costs and utility of pro-active, automated disease screening. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr. Nigam Shah, a biomedical informatics expert who combines machine learning, text-mining and medical ontologies to enable a learning health care system; Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey a world-expert in cardiovascular clinical trials; and Dr. Paul Heidenreich, an expert in implementation sciences with a focus on the use of EHR interventions to improve care quality for cardiovascular patients and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new technologies. The research proposal builds on the candidate's prior work with using machine learning and EHR data to evaluate and predict cardiovascular disease outcomes. The candidate now proposes to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms in identifying patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) using EHR data (Aim 1), evaluate whether learned classification models perform better than traditional risk factors for identification of undiagnosed PAD in a prospective patient cohort (Aim 2), and implement an EHR-based screening tool to identify patients with undiagnosed PAD and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment effects (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will result in a novel, EHR-based screening tool for identification of undiagnosed vascular disease that can decrease PAD-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through earlier and more aggressive medical management. This research will also form the basis for an R01 application before the end of the award to conduct a multi-site randomized-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of EHR- based proactive PAD screening. ! ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease is a prevalent yet under-diagnosed condition that can lead to limb loss, stroke, heart attacks and/or premature death. Work proposed in this grant aims to develop technology using electronic health records and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify patients with undiagnosed peripheral artery disease and recommend treatment. Such technology could improve the health and longevity of patients with peripheral artery disease by ensuring that patients are diagnosed early and appropriately treated.",Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease,9806796,K01HL148639,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Current Procedural Terminology Codes', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care burden', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost outcomes', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'electronic data', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'human very old age (85+)', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'post-doctoral training', 'premature', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'randomized trial', 'recurrent neural network', 'research study', 'screening', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,162000,0.031731806244521606
"Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension Title: Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension The American Diabetes Association estimates that over 25.8 million Americans have diabetes. Proper patient self-management is perhaps the most critical and under-exercised element for patients to achieve appropriate glycemic control and thus mitigate complications and comorbid conditions, and implement appropriate preventive strategies (e.g., vaccines, exercise, healthy diet). In previous work we have shown that educating patients by using content in their medical records improved diabetes outcomes and that NoteAid, a multi- module natural language processing system that links medical jargon in electronic health records to definitions, has improved self-reported comprehension. Here we propose to develop NoteAid with a high-quality resource of expert-curated lay definitions and evaluation methods for diabetes patients’ note comprehension. ! !

"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9610723,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,794994,0.059319888009179686
"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales. These methods are evaluated using public datasets to promote reproducibility, and applied to clinical research tasks that extend the knowledge of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital.",Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks,9642922,R01LM012973,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Face', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Rare Diseases', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Uncertainty', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'learning strategy', 'machine translation', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,386910,0.01667116752139345
"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,9637480,R01AG060993,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alabama', 'Algorithms', 'Ally', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational algorithm', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Staff', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'confusion assessment method', 'data mining', 'epidemiology study', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care settings', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phrases', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'ward']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2019,432969,0.05532598792420658
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9816009,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,502815,0.04780559876451506
"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,9673231,K99NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2019,90185,0.022556785092458124
"Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes new methods for representing data in electronic health records (EHR) to improve pre- dictive modeling and interpretation of patient outcomes. EHR data offer a promising opportunity for advancing the understanding of how clinical decisions and patient conditions interact over time to inﬂuence patient health. However, EHR data are difﬁcult to use for predictive modeling due to the various data types they contain (con- tinuous, categorical, text, etc.), their longitudinal nature, the high amount of non-random missingness for certain measurements, and other concerns. Furthermore, patient outcomes often have heterogenous causes and re- quire information to be synthesized from several clinical lab measures and patient visits. The core challenge at hand is overcoming the mismatch between data representations in the EHR and the assumptions underly- ing commonly used statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. To this end, this project proposes novel wrapper-based methods for learning informative features from EHR data. Both methods propose specialized operators to handle sequential data, time delays, and variable interactions, and have the capacity to discover underlying clinical rules/decisions that affect patient outcomes. Importantly, both methods also produce archives of possible models that represent the best trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, which assists in model interpretation. These method advances are made possible by encoding a rich set of data operations as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, and optimizing the graph structures using multi-objective optimization. The central hypothesis of this research is that multi-objective optimization can learn effective data representations from the EHR to produce accurate, explanatory models of patient outcomes. Preliminary work has shown that these methods can effectively learn low-order data representations that improve the predictive ability of several state- of-the-art ML methods. This technique demonstrates good scaling properties with high-dimensional biomedical data. Aim 1 (K99) is to develop a multi-objective feature engineering method that pairs with existing ML methods to iteratively improve their performance by constructing new features from the raw data and using feedback from the trained model to guide feature construction. In Aim 2 (K99), this method is applied to form predictive models of the risk of heart disease and heart failure using longitudinal EHR data. The resultant models will be inter- preted with the help of mentors in order to translate predictions into clinical recommendations. For Aim 3 (R00), a second method is proposed that uses a similar framework to optimize existing neural network approaches in order to simplify their structure as much as possible while maintaining accuracy. The goal of Aim 4 (R00) is to identify hospital patients who are at risk of readmission and propose point-of-care strategies to mitigate that risk. This goal is facilitated through the application of the proposed methods to patient data collected from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Geisinger Health System, and publicly available EHR databases.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The long-term goal of our ongoing project, “Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,” is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to understand and improve health. The EHR, because of its broad capture of human health, greatly amplifies our ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the strength of EHR data—its breadth and flexible nature—imposes additional challenges. We have found that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. We previously showed that health care process bias exists to the extent, for example, that simple use of the data can create signals implying the opposite of what we know to be true. One of the most important factors is sparse, irregular sampling; we found that sampling bias can be reduced by reparameterizing time and that prediction techniques that can accommodate EHR-specific data and resist their biases like data assimilation can be used on EHR data to produce good estimates of glucose and HA1c. The previous cycle of this project produced 75 publications. We propose to develop methods to accommodate health care process bias, using both knowledge engineering and experience with health care process bias as well as advanced statistical techniques that employ dynamical models and latent variables. We hypothesize that heuristics and models combined with knowledge can improve our ability to generate inferences and learn phenotypes despite health care process bias. Our aims are as follows: (1) Taking a knowledge engineering approach, study the effect of preprocessing and analytic choices on reducing health care process bias, and using machine learning techniques, learn more about health care process bias. (2) Taking a more empirical approach, use dynamic latent factor modeling and variation inference to accommodate health care process bias, learning how a patient's health state and health processes affect censoring, exploiting information from many variables at once. (3) Use data assimilation and mechanistic models to learn otherwise unmeasurable physiologic phenotypes despite irregular, sparse sampling typical of electronic health records. (4) Use the developed models and generated phenotypes to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project studies the biases that health care processes bring to electronic health record data, and it develops methods to overcome those biases to improve reuse of the data for purposes such as clinical research and quality improvement.",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,9659641,R01LM006910,"['Active Learning', 'Adopted', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Award', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Insulin', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Observational Study', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'clinical database', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,596772,0.04009937042886866
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes. Narrative The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the search of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes.

"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,9660167,R01MH116042,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Boston', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'outpatient programs', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,892010,0.05224230338580964
"2/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai.

"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes innovative intelligent biomedical natural language process approaches to detect ADEs in patients' electronic health records (EHRs), an important step towards ADE surveillance and pharmacovigilance. The focus of this proposal will bon the national priority area of anticoagulants ADE detection, although the algorithms and systems we develop can be extended to other drug classes and diseases.

"Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD Project Summary This NHLBI K01 application supports the career development of Dr. Nrupen A. Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data. In patients with diabetes at risk of cardiovascular disease events, I will examine the impact that missing data has on the ability to use the EHR for clinical research and develop approaches to address the biases resulting from missing data.",Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD,9742515,K01HL140146,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Baptist Church', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Population Study', 'Privacy', 'Publishing', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'South Carolina', 'Stroke', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'care seeking', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'distributed data', 'electronic data', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'forest', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'practical application', 'professor', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'study population']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,165554,0.05200349077940152
"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research,9641499,R01MH118233,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data resource', 'delay sex', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'sex', 'support tools']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,855687,0.06924678576053499
"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9626417,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'septic patients', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,616807,0.05957630037087841
"Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic cigarettes were developed in China in the early 2000s and first introduced to the US market in 2007. Once established in the US, the product experienced explosive growth, with the number of electronic cigarette users doubling every year between 2008 and 2012. In 2012, it was estimated that 75% of US adults had heard of electronic cigarettes, and 8% had tried them. While electronic cigarettes have been studied over the last sev- eral years, no scientific consensus has emerged regarding either the safety of electronic cigarettes, or their po- tential as a smoking cessation aid. With this proposal, we will investigate how electronic cigarette use is documented in the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record, focusing specifically on the relationship between electronic cigarette use and com- bustible tobacco use, with the goal of understanding both how electronic cigarette use is documented in the context of the United States’ only nationwide health system, and how electronic cigarette related information can be reliably extracted from narrative clinical text using fully automated Natural Language Processing meth- ods. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research focuses on the use of Natural Language Processing methods to automatically extract mentions of electronic cigarette use from the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record. The research will provide insight into important, currently unresolved questions regarding how clinicians record electronic cigarette use in the context of a nationwide health system, and whether patients report the use of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid or use the devices in conjunction with combustible tobacco.",Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR,9652537,R03DA047577,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Professional Organizations', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Smoking', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Tweens', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'authority', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic hookah', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'vaping']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2019,76250,0.032157752602093054
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) proposes to contribute as a funded site in the eMERGE III Network by pursuing a series of initiatives designed to advance genomics and the electronic health record (EHR). We propose 100 genes to evaluate by sequencing in 2,000 patients consented for return of results, to advance genomics by evaluating fee for service for DNA sequence-based genetic testing at CCHMC, to develop the reliable identification many diseases in the EHR and along with genome wide genetic testing, to explore genetic variants for alleged and unknown clinical manifestations, to extend the work of eMERGE to other large collections of EHR and genetic data, to evaluate cost benefits of genetic testing, to characterize the genetics of pain, to explor the preferences of adolescents concerning the genetic results they prefer to learn, and to explore the legal, ethical, and social issues that surround the re-interpretation of genetic variants.

"Improve medical decision making in emergency medicine via a new interface to visualize and understand relevant prior history for complex patients at the point-of-care. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Patient Insight is working to drive more informed medical decisions by designing a real-time interface that dynamically captures and presents prior history for complex patients in less time and with more completeness than using their electronic health record (EHR) system. The company is developing proprietary data mining and natural language processing algorithms that show promise for identifying, aggregating, and displaying the most essential EHR data for patients with complex conditions while at the same time working with clinicians to design the visual interface to reduce the cognitive burden and support diagnosis and treatment decisions. The specific goals of this phase I project are to test the feasibility of developing Patient Insight’s core solution to (1) use advanced analytics and natural language processing to mine and prioritize the most relevant information for use by (ED) physicians and (2) develop an clinician-informed, visual display of that essential information to timely support clinical decision-making sufficient to reduce medical errors, improve health, and control costs. In phase I, Patient Insight will work with Universal Health Systems, the parent company of George Washington University Hospital, to co-develop and test the platform for efficacy in the ED as a precursor to continued development of this core solution/product. This will involve using EHR data to assess comprehensiveness to reconstruct history for five groups of chronically ill patients (e.g., advanced cancer, coronary heart disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic pain, and schizophrenia) who are admitted with high-frequency chief complaints of abdominal pain, chest pain, and fever. This will include mining, prioritizing, and presenting information to clinicians using a total of 30 dimensions of data regarding patient’s prior ED and hospital visits including both structured (e.g., diagnosis, medications, labs, imaging test types, EKG date/time) and unstructured data (e.g., images, physician notes, consult notes) to establish physician consensus on the data most valuable to medical decision-making and co-design data visualization tools to render a clear patient history. Our aims include: (Aim 1) Establishing the feasibility of leveraging provider-as-user-centered design to guide development of a data visualization platform that enables providers to readily “see” the most complete patient record for the five groups of complex patients, and (Aim 2) Conducting usability testing and compare the completeness and efficiency of using the enhanced platform on the five patient categories with usual care. Success in phase I will enable the company to validate a ‘proof of concept’ for developing its clinician-as-user-centered design process to inform a phase II research and development effort to design a commercially viable clinical decision support tool for hospitals and health systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patient Insight seeks to determine the feasibility of its proposed platform to aggregate and present the clearest picture possible of a patient’s history for time-constrained emergency department (ED) providers sufficient to drive improved medical decision-making, safety, and improved health outcomes for complex patients at the point-of-care and across disparate EHR systems. The strategy is to leverage our capability to extract discreet and unstructured data from select EHR systems and engage providers in the design of key elements of information display to reduce duplicate testing, lower medical errors related to misinformed treatment choices, and reduce unnecessary treatment and costs. Proving feasibility will enable Patient Insight to structure a partnership with Universal Health Services and inform further development and testing of its core solution across multiple ED facilities.",Improve medical decision making in emergency medicine via a new interface to visualize and understand relevant prior history for complex patients at the point-of-care.,9778547,R43LM013130,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Consult', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cost Control', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intuition', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical History', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Schizophrenia', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Washington', 'Work', 'chronic pain', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive load', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'information display', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'point of care', 'research and development', 'stem', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment choice', 'unnecessary treatment', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NLM,"PATIENT INSIGHT, INC.",R43,2019,155520,0.031173220454671996
"Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish a genomic medicine learning system to accelerate genomic knowledge discovery and application in electronic health records (EHRs). We will integrate deep characteristic phenotypes extracted from EHRs and evolving knowledge of genotype-phenotype associations to optimize the accuracy of variant interpretation and the cost-effectiveness of clinical genome/exome sequencing, and to accelerate the discovery of causal genes by constructing a dynamic genotype-phenotype knowledge network. Prior knowledge on phenotype-gene relationships and phenotypic information about patients can facilitate the identification of disease-causing mutations from thousands of genetic variants in the context of clinical genomic sequencing; however, how best to abstract phenotype information from notes in the EHRs of patients who are diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, standardize the computable representation of phenotypes, and utilize it in genomic interpretation remains unclear. Additionally, how to systematically compare phenotypes across diseases to discover new knowledge in human genetics remains a largely untapped area with great promise. To address these challenges, we will develop and validate scalable and portable open-source natural language processing (NLP) methods for automated and accurate abstraction of characteristic phenotype concepts (e.g., “j-shaped sella turcica” and “short stature”) from EHR narratives. We will then develop a phenotype-driven scoring system called EHR-Phenolyzer to predict the likely candidate genetic variants associated with the phenotypes for patients with genomic sequencing and a high probability of a monogenic condition. On this basis, we will develop a probabilistic disease diagnosis and knowledge discovery system using rich and deep EHR phenotypes, and evaluate these methods for genomic diagnosis and discovery using large- scale clinical exome sequencing data. Ultimately, these methods will support efficient, effective, and scalable genomic diagnostics, and facilitate the implementation of genome-guided precision medicine in clinical practice. NARRATIVE We will develop novel informatics methods to abstract characteristic phenotypes from electronic health records (EHRs) for patients diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, enable the interoperability of computable characteristic phenotypes with existing phenotype-genotype association knowledge such as OMIM and ClinVar, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of genomic diagnostics.",Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine,9786822,R01LM012895,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'cost effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'disease-causing mutation', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'health record', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'pituitary fossa', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,399965,0.03837023532832043
"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The proposed research and career development plan are relevant to public health because health care- associated infections (HAIs) affect about one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $30 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. The objective of this project is to develop robust and portable automated surveillance toolkit that combines structured EHR data with rich information locked in clinical notes using natural language processing to identify HAIs after surgical procedures.

"Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics ABSTRACT Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgical procedure in the nation. Despite the high procedure volume, the evidence base for TJA procedures and associated interventions are limited. This is mainly due to lack of high quality data sources and the logistical difficulties associated with manually extracting TJA information from the unstructured text of the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of EHR and the advances in health information technology offer the potential to transform unstructured EHR notes into structured, codified format that can then be analyzed and shared with local and national arthroplasty registries and other agencies. We therefore propose to leverage unique data resources and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to build an informatics infrastructure for automated EHR data extraction and analysis. We will (1) develop a high performance, externally validated and user centric NLP- enabled algorithm for extraction of complex TJA-specific data elements from the structured and unstructured text of the EHR, (2) validate the algorithm externally in multiple EHR platforms and hospital settings, and (3) conduct a demonstration project focused on prediction of prosthetic joint infections using data elements collected by the NLP-enabled algorithm. Our overarching goal is to develop valid, open source and portable NLP-enabled data collection and risk prediction tools and disseminate them widely to hospitals participating in regional and national TJA registries. This research is significant as it leverages strong data resources and expertise to tackle the pressing need for high quality data and accurate prediction models in TJA. Automated data collection and processing capabilities will lead to an upsurge in secondary use of EHR to advance scientific knowledge on TJA risk factors, healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Accurate prediction of high risk patients for prosthetic joint infections will guide prevention and treatment decisions resulting in significant health benefits to TJA patients. The research is innovative because TJA-specific bioinformatics technology will shift TJA research from current under-powered, single-center studies to large, multi-center registry-based observational studies and clinical trials. Our deliverables have the potential to exert a sustained downstream effect on future TJA research, practice and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Lack of high quality data is a critical barrier to progress in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) research. We will utilize health information technology to automate extraction of rich TJA information from the electronic health records, and develop a robust risk prediction score for prosthetic joint infections, a devastating and yet preventable complication of TJA. Widespread adoption of these tools will enhance data collection capabilities and enable affordable large scale studies for practice improvements through secondary use of real-world data. Accurate prediction of post- operative infection risk among TJA candidates will guide individualized preventive strategies for modifiable risk factors, thereby reducing the burden of prosthetic joint infections in TJA patients.",Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics,9657648,R01AR073147,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guide prevention', 'Health Benefit', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'age group', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'joint infection', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'portability', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction model', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'willingness']",NIAMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,636882,0.09212114145029991
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2 million patients at Vanderbilt (including 10,000 genotyped statin recipients) to answer these questions.",Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort,9650406,R01HL133786,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Breast', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataract', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Colorectal', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prostate', 'Qi', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer risk', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'glutaryl coA', 'individual response', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,410983,0.05294511478016859
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9774751,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'pharmacovigilance', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2019,600683,0.0710352050845338
"Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization Project summary Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health and criminal justice problem that negatively impacts millions of victims yearly in the United States, primarily women (85%). Most IPV-related healthcare visits (83%) occurred in an emergency department (ED), and these clinical encounters are unique opportunities to identify IPV victims and potentially provide assistance. Although numerous health professional organizations have endorsed universal screening and counseling for IPV since 1992, actual screening rates, detection of IPV victims, and referrals to IPV services remain low in the ED. As a result, many IPV victims pass through the ED unidentified and untreated. Computerized screening tools have been developed and implemented in clinical settings in order to assist providers in screening and detecting IPV. However, these tools have a great limitation in that they rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHR). Recently, researchers demonstrated that a history of IPV diagnoses and associated clinical symptoms highly predict current and future IPV (OR=7.8), and these important IPV data could serve as red flags that trigger providers to assess patients further for IPV. In order to enhance IPV screening in the ED, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summarizer that extracts, abstracts and synthesizes patient historical IPV data (structured and unstructured), and delivers patient historical IPV data to ED providers through an intuitive interface. The specific aims are: 1) develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) strategies to identify and extract patient historical IPV incidents and timelines from clinic notes; 2) develop and evaluate a web service-based summary tool (IPV-Summary-Service) that synthesizes patient- specific IPV information from both NLP-processed data elements and structured data; and 3) develop and pilot test an enhanced IPV screening strategy that delivers clinical evidence generated by the IPV-Summary- Service through a specific EHR (Epic) to providers during the patient universal IPV screening in the ED. This automatic clinical date summary for IPV will be piloted in one ED at MUSC. There are two major outcomes to be measured for the IPV-Summary enhanced screening for 6 months before and after the index date of pilot testing: 1) rate of successful referral to the IPV 24-hour dedicated IPV nurse; and 2) rate of initiation of referral and identification of persons at high risk of IPV. We will use mixed effect generalized linear regression models to estimate the effects of IPV-Summary on the referral rate and IPV case identification rate. Through survey studies, we will assess secondary outcomes including factors of system feasibility, usability, and providers' satisfaction. These analyses can identify potentially important correlates of the major outcomes and may help us improve the design of the intervention. The results from this study will form the foundation for a broader implementation in a regional health information exchange for EDs. Narrative Computer-based approaches for intimate partner violence (IPV) universal screening have led to significantly higher screening rate and detection rate, as well as receipt of IPV services in the emergency department (ED). However, these approaches rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal IPV data existing in electronic health records (EHR), which have high predictive power of IPV risk. In order to enhance the effectiveness of IPV screening, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summary tool that extracts, abstracts, and synthesizes patient historical IPV information from EHR and then delivers that critical information to ED providers at the point of care.",Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization,9739347,R21LM012945,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Event', 'Face', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Professional', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Violent injury', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'intimate partner violence', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability', 'web services']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2019,168188,0.06588436110728381
"Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology PROJECT SUMMARY Healthcare has changed rapidly in the last decade with the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) and the creation of national EHR-based data networks that aim to improve the quality of care. The American College of Rheumatology's RISE registry is a federally Qualified Clinical Data Registry that collects EHR data from the practices of almost 1000 rheumatologists nationally, analyzes these data centrally, and continuously feeds back performance on quality measures to practices via a web-based dashboard. In this K24 proposal, the applicant proposes to utilize novel methods in clinical informatics to increase the accuracy of quality measurement, while also developing and testing new EHR-based quality measures relevant to rheumatic diseases. The proposed research will leverage her strong research portfolio, including grants from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, her successful track record of achieving national endorsement for EHR-based quality measures, existing data from over 1.4 million patients in the RISE database, and the outstanding institutional environment at the University of California, San Francisco. It will also support her ongoing career development in clinical informatics methods relevant to EHR-based clinical research. For this five year K24 award proposal, she plans to increase the time spent mentoring junior investigators in the field or quality and outcomes measurement in rheumatology, with the goal of helping trainees successfully launch academic research careers in patient- oriented research. Aligned with a comprehensive mentoring plan, the proposal outlines two specific aims, including using natural language processing to increase the accuracy of EHR-based quality measurement in RISE, and developing and validating new, prototype electronic clinical quality measures to monitor and address high impact gaps in care for patients with rheumatic disease. The work will prioritize outcome measures and use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model and Health Quality Measures Format to develop, specify and test measures. Measures developed through this research and mentoring program will be candidates for nationwide dissemination across rheumatology practices to improve care for individuals with rheumatic disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This mid-career investigator award will support a program in patient-oriented research in rheumatic diseases at the University of California, San Francisco. The award will allow the applicant to expand her research on the development and validation of health care quality measures and support her mentoring of early investigators.

"Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions Project Summary  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) are morbid immunologic reactions to drugs that confer a mortality of 10-50%. Over the last decade, significant promise for prediction and prevention has come from the discovery that many SCARs are associated with variation within HLA class I alleles. For HLA-B*15:02, this has led to routine pre-prescription screening for carbamazepine in many Southeast Asian countries and a significant reduction in cases of carbamazepine SJS/TEN. Despite this progress, there is little known about genetic and epidemiological risk factors for SCARs related to commonly used drugs such as antibiotics. There is also limited information about HLA risk for SCARs across the diverse populations present in the United States. Furthermore, imprecision of clinical phenotyping and lack of standardized coding has led to challenges in finding SCAR cases in the electronic health record (EHR). Our proposed study aims to address critical challenges and gaps in our knowledge of antibiotic SCARs.  In Aim 1, we will leverage advanced informatics and longitudinal EHR data for over 11 million patients from Partners HealthCare System since the 1980s to identify SCAR cases. We will create, optimize and standardize reproducible methods for finding SCAR cases and validating a cohort of SCAR patients. This iterative process will be used to refine and disseminate an electronic phenotype to be validated cross-institutionally.  In Aim 2, we will analyze SCAR prevalence and conduct a case-control study to identify drug-specific and patient-specific risk factors for antibiotic-associated SCARs. We will compare clinical sequelae, quality of life and adherence of SCAR patients compared to controls through validated survey instruments.  In Aim 3, we will identify candidate HLA and genetic associations from patients with validated antibiotic- associated SCARs. We will examine difference in genetic risk in minority and health disparity populations and predict that we will be powered to establish HLA associations for vancomycin DRESS (i.e., drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) and sulfonamide antimicrobial and beta-lactam SCAR. HLA alone, or in combination with clinical risk factors, can lead to improved SCAR prevention and early diagnosis. We will establish a data sharing platform, in the form of an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.  The roadmap we develop will translate into the development of electronic phenotypes for serious adverse drug reactions that facilitate genetic discovery. Knowledge gained will be crucial to the translation of genetic data into clinical decision making. This is in close alignment with NIH’s research mission to accelerate genetic discovery for iatrogenic and preventable drug-induced diseases that will translate into prevention, earlier diagnosis and an enhanced mechanistic understanding that may lead to targeted therapeutic approaches. Narrative  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) result in substantial morbidity, long term disability, health care burden and a mortality of 10-50%. To advance the science of clinical and genetic risk factor identification for antibiotic SCAR, we will leverage large electronic health record (EHR) data and advanced informatics technology. Through case validation we will create an informatics roadmap for other institutions with similar EHR data to identify SCAR cases and we will establish a data sharing platform, including an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.",Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions,9857829,R01AI150295,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Allopurinol', 'Antibiotics', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biological Markers', 'Carbamazepine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Comorbidity', 'Country', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Administration Routes', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eosinophilia', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Female', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monobactams', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nevirapine', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Sulfonamides', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin', 'Variant', 'abacavir', 'adverse drug reaction', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'care burden', 'case control', 'case finding', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'health disparity', 'immunoreaction', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'sex', 'southeast Asian', 'targeted treatment']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,689571,0.051615578831675765

"National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms PROJECT SUMMARY With the rapidly growing adoption of patient electronic health record systems (EHRs) due to Meaningful Use, and linkage of EHRs to research biorepositories, evaluating the suitability of EHR data for clinical and translational research is becoming ever more important, with ramifications for genomic and observational research, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness studies. A key component for identifying patient cohorts in the EHR is to define inclusion and exclusion criteria that algorithmically select sets of patients based on stored clinical data. This process is commonly referred to, as “EHR-driven phenotyping” is time-consuming and tedious due to the lack of a widely accepted and standards-based formal information model for defining phenotyping algorithms. To address this overall challenge, the proposed project will design, build and promote an open-access community infrastructure for standards-based development and sharing of phenotyping algorithms, as well as provide tools and resources for investigators, researchers and their informatics support staff to implement and execute the algorithms on native EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of patient cohorts for clinical and genomic research is a costly and time-consuming process. This bottleneck adversely affects public health by delaying research findings, and in some cases by making research costs prohibitively high. To address this issue, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) for identifying patient cohorts has become an increasingly attractive option. This proposal will investigate and implement standards based approaches for computable phenotype identification from multiple EHRs.",National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms,9774075,R01GM105688,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Flowcharts', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Logic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Needs Assessment', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'University Hospitals', 'authority', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'database query', 'deep learning', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics training', 'information model', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'repository', 'syntax', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,706851,0.13775121907952223
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9749154,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,178606,0.059077826236970485
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients. The proposed work will have a significant impact on clinical management of FH patients.",EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia,9730585,R01HL135879,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Awareness', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Europe', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Lipoprotein (a)', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Primary Prevention', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Time', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Xanthomas', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care providers', 'case-based', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'epidemiology study', 'evaluation/testing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'lifetime risk', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutics', 'point of care', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'premature', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening program', 'shared decision making', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,675136,0.09977813393051335
"EHR-based Genomic Discovery and Implementation PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned for genomic discovery and for implementing genomic medicine to improve patient care. In eMERGE I, we leveraged an EHR-linked biobank, high-density genotyping data, and electronic phenotyping algorithms to discover 29 genetic loci associated with cardiovascular traits. In eMERGE II we began implementing genomic medicine by conducting an EHR-based randomized clinical trial of disclosing genomic risk of coronary heart disease and incorporating pharmacogenomic information in the EHR with linkage to clinical decision support. In eMERGE III, we propose to build on our prior work to conduct a genomic medicine implementation project to establish mechanisms for return of actionable findings from targeted sequencing of 100 disease-relevant genes. Focusing on two common genetic disorders–familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial colorectal cancer (CRC)–we will begin to translate genomic discovery and implementation efforts in eMERGE to impact public health. We will obtain informed consent from 3000 participants of Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester MN and Phoenix AZ who have moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps. DNA will be sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 100 disease genes. We will use state-of-the-art methods to classify variant pathogenicity, finalize actionable variants for return, examine near-term outcomes, economic implications and behavioral and psychosocial consequences of such return. We will also conduct genomic discovery leveraging a network-wide data set of ~25,000 individuals with sequence data and an existing network-wide data set of ~50,000 individuals with high-density genotype data linked to the EHR. We will exploit the unique potential of the EHR to assess pleiotropy using novel approaches. In partnership with Mountain Park Health Center, a primary care practice that serves a minority population of Mexican Americans in Phoenix AZ, we will contribute high-density genotyping and phenotype data on 1000 Hispanics for genomic discovery and pilot mechanisms for implementing genomic medicine at this site.

"Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data PROJECT SUMMARY Large electronic health record research (EHR) data integrated with -omics data from linked biorepositories have expanded opportunities for precision medicine research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized cancer risk and progression prediction models, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice and ultimately realize the promise of precision oncology. However, efficiently and effectively using EHR for cancer research remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, obtaining precise event time information such as time of cancer recurrence is a major bottleneck in using EHR for precision medicine research due to the requirement of laborious medical record review and the lack of documentation. Simple estimates of the event time based on billing or procedure codes may poorly approximate the true event time. Naive use of such estimated event times can lead to highly biased estimates due to the approximation error. Such biases impose challenges to performing pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time to events and captured using EHR. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill these methodological gaps in risk assessment for cancer research using EHR data, which will advance our ability to achieve the promise of precision oncology. Statistical algorithms and software will be developed to (i) automatically assign event time information using longitudinally recorded EHR information; and (ii) to perform accurate risk assessment using noisy proxies of event times. The proposed tools for risk assessment using imperfect EHR data without requiring extensive manual chart review could greatly improve the utility of EHR for oncology research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses major methodological gaps in effectively utilizing EHR data for risk assessment due to the noisy nature of EHR data. We propose novel statistical algorithms and software to (i) efficiently annotate event time by combining multiple longitudinally recorded code information and (ii) to provide precise risk estimates using noisy proxies of event times. By drawing upon the rich albeit imperfect data from bio-repository linked EHR, our algorithms will advance our ability to use EHR data for precision oncology research.",Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data,9827744,R21CA242940,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Boston', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proxy', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'adjudicate', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2019,192385,0.14293505847630225

Here we propose to develop NoteAid with a high-quality resource of expert-curated lay definitions and evaluation methods for diabetes patients’ note comprehension. ! !",Resource Curation and Evaluation for EHR Note Comprehension,9670540,R01LM012817,"['AIDS education', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Data Science', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Eye diseases', 'General Population', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Students', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Students', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Prevention strategy', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Reading', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Self Management', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Visual Aid', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'glycemic control', 'good diet', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2018,370291,0.04743036237173567
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9442890,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,794994,0.059319888009179686

"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,9504168,K99NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2018,90050,0.022556785092458124

"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9479293,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'patient portal', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2018,248999,0.07750441072940388
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes.

"Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives Project Summary Medicine has evolved into an era where the entire hospital progressively adopts more real-time monitoring for the patients and generates ICU like clinical data. The rapidly growing data makes ICU a snapshot for tomorrow’s standard of care that should benefit from computer-aided decision making. These data contain not only numerical or coded information, but also a large volume of unstructured narrative text such as physicians’ and nurses' notes, specialists' reports, and discharge summaries. Both types of data have been shown to be highly informative for tasks such as cohort selection, and work best in combination. However, to achieve this, specific bits of information must be extracted from the narrative reports and coded in formal representation. These bits include medical concepts such as symptoms, diseases, medications and procedures; characteristics such as certainty, severity, dose; assertions about these items, such as whether they pertain to the patient or a family member, etc.; relations among these mentions, including indications of what condition is treated by what action and its degree of success, the time sequence and duration of events, and interpretations of laboratory test results as relations among medical concepts such as cells and antigens (e.g., “[large atypical cells] express [CD30]”). Concepts and assertions can be regarded as simple relations, and our proposal focuses on modeling narrative relations to augment structured data for predicting patient outcomes. Most existing techniques for interpreting clinical narratives either rely on hand-crafted rule systems and large medical thesauri or are based on machine learning models that create classification or regression models from large annotated data sets. The former are difficult and laborious to generalize, whereas the latter require large volumes of human-labeled data and may result in models whose operation is difficult to interpret and is therefore considered unsuitable for computer-aided decision making. We propose to build on our previous work to use unsupervised learning methods that identify frequent patterns in un-annotated narratives and identify informative patterns by tensor factorization. Although existing methods can also identify patterns that are meaningful in a data-driven sense, these patterns are difficult for clinicians to understand. Our specific goal is to develop a novel method that uses a Bayesian generative model that integrates relation mining with tensor factorization to learn patterns that correspond to an understanding of the clinical domain and can be used for evidence based patient outcome prediction. Our framework represents relations in clinical narratives as graphs, then mines subgraphs for important relations. These relations are used as features in building up a tensor model in order to reduce dimensionality, discover coherent groups of relations, and explore the group interactions. We develop Bayesian formulation to integrate relation mining and tensor modeling in a generative model, to incorporate existing medical knowledge as probability priors, as well as to reliably estimate the posterior probabilities and confidence intervals of any findings from the model. Rapid growth in the hospital adoption of large volume of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has led to an unprecedented availability of narrative dataset for clinical and translational research. We propose the development of a novel Bayesian generative framework to enable extraction of accurate and clinically meaningful patterns of EHR narratives in order to support evidence based diagnostic reasoning and outcome risk prediction.",Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives,9535479,R21LM012618,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Appearance', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Assisted', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Research Council', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TNFRSF8 gene', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic panel', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'rapid growth', 'real time monitoring', 'standard of care', 'success', 'unsupervised learning']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2018,181755,0.035201583099285325
"Algorithms to Identify Systemic Lupus from Electronic Health Record Data Abstract  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that is often difficult to diagnose because of the diverse manifestations that occur over time and across care sites leading to increased damage and early mortality. The personal and economic costs in decreased quality of life and increase in healthcare expenditures, respectively, highlight the critical unmet need to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat lupus, so that treatment or participation in clinical trials occurs as early as possible to mitigate against disease-related damage. Therefore, it is important to find better ways to identify SLE patents.  Electronic health records (EHR) are now used in a majority of health care settings throughout the country, and present a rich source of information about patients which can be mined for earlier diagnosis and identification to improve quality of care, or enable high throughput clinical studies. Despite this potential, to date few accurate algorithms have been developed to identify SLE patients using EHR data. Construction of an effective algorithm, either by rule-based or machine learning methods, requires access to at two data resources not commonly available: 1) a validated “gold standard” patient data set with clear documentation of criteria that are indicative of SLE that can be compared against EHR data and 2) an integrated health record dataset that contains data from multiple health care institutions and reflects that SLE patients receive healthcare at multiple institutions and healthcare providers given their chronic, progressive disease. Over the past several years, our team has created both key resources: the Chicago Lupus Database (CLD), a physician-validated registry of 880 patients and gold standard data set and the Chicago HealthLNK Data Repository (HDR), a regional data resource including integrated medical records for 2.1 million patients across multiple institutions. Jointly, these two datasets enable the creation, testing and validation of algorithms for the identification of SLE in EHR data and provide a more complete picture of a patient population at risk for lupus.  We propose three specific aims to address the need to reduce the time to identify those with SLE in order to initiate treatment in a timelier fashion and to identify candidates for clinical trials. These aims are: 1) To create and validate a series of algorithms to identify SLE patients in EHR data against a gold standard curated registry, CLD, using validated classification criteria for SLE to build concepts for rule-based and machine learning methods that incorporate structured data, laboratory data, and unstructured data, e.g., physician notes, 2) To determine whether identification of SLE patients is improved when algorithms to identify SLE patients are extended to an integrated medical record dataset that includes data from multiple health care institutions, and 3) To use clustering techniques on SLE patients identified from EHR data to isolate clinically distinct sub-populations of patients, which could inform patient selection for participation in clinical trials. Project Narrative  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that is often difficult to diagnose because of the diverse manifestations that occur over time and across care sites leading to increased damage and early mortality. Electronic health records (EHR) are now used in a majority of health care settings throughout the country, and present a rich source of information about patients which can be mined for earlier diagnosis and identification to improve quality of care, or enable high throughput clinical studies. This study will test and validate algorithms for the identification of SLE from EHR data and thus will help provide a more complete picture of a patient population at risk for lupus.",Algorithms to Identify Systemic Lupus from Electronic Health Record Data,9536683,R21AR072263,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Flare', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Populations at Risk', 'Progressive Disease', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical practice', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'economic cost', 'health care settings', 'health record', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation']",NIAMS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2018,173800,0.08270295260067047

Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data.

"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9419932,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'septic patients', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,623932,0.05957630037087841
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) proposes to contribute as a funded site in the eMERGE III Network by pursuing a series of initiatives designed to advance genomics and the electronic health record (EHR). We propose 100 genes to evaluate by sequencing in 2,000 patients consented for return of results, to advance genomics by evaluating fee for service for DNA sequence-based genetic testing at CCHMC, to develop the reliable identification many diseases in the EHR and along with genome wide genetic testing, to explore genetic variants for alleged and unknown clinical manifestations, to extend the work of eMERGE to other large collections of EHR and genetic data, to evaluate cost benefits of genetic testing, to characterize the genetics of pain, to explor the preferences of adolescents concerning the genetic results they prefer to learn, and to explore the legal, ethical, and social issues that surround the re-interpretation of genetic variants.

"Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish a genomic medicine learning system to accelerate genomic knowledge discovery and application in electronic health records (EHRs). We will integrate deep characteristic phenotypes extracted from EHRs and evolving knowledge of genotype-phenotype associations to optimize the accuracy of variant interpretation and the cost-effectiveness of clinical genome/exome sequencing, and to accelerate the discovery of causal genes by constructing a dynamic genotype-phenotype knowledge network. Prior knowledge on phenotype-gene relationships and phenotypic information about patients can facilitate the identification of disease-causing mutations from thousands of genetic variants in the context of clinical genomic sequencing; however, how best to abstract phenotype information from notes in the EHRs of patients who are diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, standardize the computable representation of phenotypes, and utilize it in genomic interpretation remains unclear. Additionally, how to systematically compare phenotypes across diseases to discover new knowledge in human genetics remains a largely untapped area with great promise. To address these challenges, we will develop and validate scalable and portable open-source natural language processing (NLP) methods for automated and accurate abstraction of characteristic phenotype concepts (e.g., “j-shaped sella turcica” and “short stature”) from EHR narratives. We will then develop a phenotype-driven scoring system called EHR-Phenolyzer to predict the likely candidate genetic variants associated with the phenotypes for patients with genomic sequencing and a high probability of a monogenic condition. On this basis, we will develop a probabilistic disease diagnosis and knowledge discovery system using rich and deep EHR phenotypes, and evaluate these methods for genomic diagnosis and discovery using large- scale clinical exome sequencing data. Ultimately, these methods will support efficient, effective, and scalable genomic diagnostics, and facilitate the implementation of genome-guided precision medicine in clinical practice. NARRATIVE We will develop novel informatics methods to abstract characteristic phenotypes from electronic health records (EHRs) for patients diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, enable the interoperability of computable characteristic phenotypes with existing phenotype-genotype association knowledge such as OMIM and ClinVar, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of genomic diagnostics.",Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine,9544417,R01LM012895,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'cost effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'disease-causing mutation', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'health record', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'pituitary fossa', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,399949,0.03837023532832043
"Improving accreditation, certification and quality improvement programs through automated abstraction of electronic health data. ABSTRACT SBIR Phase I: Reduce the burden of data abstraction for certification, accreditation and quality improvement programs via a new platform to automate the abstraction of measures and a novel interface to improve human abstractor workflow. The broad impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is to drive down the burden of participation in quality improvement programs, specifically, the resource intensive manual data abstraction process to derive and report quality measures that are instrumental to improving health outcomes and controlling costs. Patient Insight proposes improvements through automated abstraction methods and an interface for human abstractors to better visualize electronic health record (EHR) data and complete their work. The existing approach is a barrier to broader uptake of quality improvement initiatives such as accreditation. Patient Insight’s proposed solution consists of leveraging both proven and proprietary technologies to extract data via EHR agnostic application programming interfaces (APIs), better target eligible patients, and calculate measures via natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and custom queries. The core innovation is a novel data mining engine and user interface that improves the process of human data abstraction for clinical and quality documentation such as those required to achieve accreditation. The proposed project will allow Patient Insight, in partnership with the American College of Cardiology, a leader in the hospital based accreditation space, to develop a proof-of-concept pilot project at a select hospital and compare human and automated data abstraction methods for a pre-selected number of measures that are mandated as part of the ACC’s Heart Failure Accreditation program. Once completed, Patient Insight will expand on the technology, design and user research data/requirements with a roadmap for product enhancements for Phase II that will enable the building of a commercially viable ‘add-on’ service for sites participating in the ACC’s suite of accreditation programs and eventually expand to additional ACC service lines as well as other accreditation and certifying bodies. Success will represent a transformative change in general-purpose abstraction and an interface that will support a broad array of accreditation measures and abstraction workflows thereby solving a critical inefficiency both clinically and financially for hospitals while improving patient health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Health service accreditation and certification programs are a critical mechanism to direct care quality improvements and ensure compliance with regulations. Reporting on requisite measures is a resource intensive and costly process requiring human data abstractors to interpret heterogeneous and disparately presented data elements from the electronic health record (EHR). Replacing human elements using evolving automated data abstraction methods and an interface for abstractors to better visualize EHR data and manage their workflow would solve an important, unmet need and offer a dramatic improvement over the status quo. Patient Insight’s commercial technology solution will facilitate efficiencies in automated data abstraction and human-to-computer interactions in quality improvement reporting.","Improving accreditation, certification and quality improvement programs through automated abstraction of electronic health data.",9622944,R43LM012955,"['Accreditation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Budgets', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Cost Control', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Diuretics', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Technology', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Schedule', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cardiology service', 'certificate program', 'college', 'cost', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'exercise program', 'follow-up', 'health assessment', 'health data', 'human data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'new technology', 'novel', 'product development', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'success', 'tool', 'uptake', 'usability']",NLM,"PATIENT INSIGHT, INC.",R43,2018,259060,0.04276449688474771
"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The proposed research and career development plan are relevant to public health because health care- associated infections (HAIs) affect about one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $30 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. The objective of this project is to develop robust and portable automated surveillance toolkit that combines structured EHR data with rich information locked in clinical notes using natural language processing to identify HAIs after surgical procedures.

"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9534182,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient-clinician communication', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2018,335217,0.12001917194239468
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort - Diversity Supplement Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects.

"Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics ABSTRACT Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgical procedure in the nation. Despite the high procedure volume, the evidence base for TJA procedures and associated interventions are limited. This is mainly due to lack of high quality data sources and the logistical difficulties associated with manually extracting TJA information from the unstructured text of the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of EHR and the advances in health information technology offer the potential to transform unstructured EHR notes into structured, codified format that can then be analyzed and shared with local and national arthroplasty registries and other agencies. We therefore propose to leverage unique data resources and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to build an informatics infrastructure for automated EHR data extraction and analysis. We will (1) develop a high performance, externally validated and user centric NLP- enabled algorithm for extraction of complex TJA-specific data elements from the structured and unstructured text of the EHR, (2) validate the algorithm externally in multiple EHR platforms and hospital settings, and (3) conduct a demonstration project focused on prediction of prosthetic joint infections using data elements collected by the NLP-enabled algorithm. Our overarching goal is to develop valid, open source and portable NLP-enabled data collection and risk prediction tools and disseminate them widely to hospitals participating in regional and national TJA registries. This research is significant as it leverages strong data resources and expertise to tackle the pressing need for high quality data and accurate prediction models in TJA. Automated data collection and processing capabilities will lead to an upsurge in secondary use of EHR to advance scientific knowledge on TJA risk factors, healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Accurate prediction of high risk patients for prosthetic joint infections will guide prevention and treatment decisions resulting in significant health benefits to TJA patients. The research is innovative because TJA-specific bioinformatics technology will shift TJA research from current under-powered, single-center studies to large, multi-center registry-based observational studies and clinical trials. Our deliverables have the potential to exert a sustained downstream effect on future TJA research, practice and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Lack of high quality data is a critical barrier to progress in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) research. We will utilize health information technology to automate extraction of rich TJA information from the electronic health records, and develop a robust risk prediction score for prosthetic joint infections, a devastating and yet preventable complication of TJA. Widespread adoption of these tools will enhance data collection capabilities and enable affordable large scale studies for practice improvements through secondary use of real-world data. Accurate prediction of post- operative infection risk among TJA candidates will guide individualized preventive strategies for modifiable risk factors, thereby reducing the burden of prosthetic joint infections in TJA patients.",Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics,9486584,R01AR073147,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guide prevention', 'Health Benefit', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'age group', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'joint infection', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'portability', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'willingness']",NIAMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,484387,0.09212114145029991

"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users).

"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values. This work aims to improve our ability to extract useful information from electronic health records to enable disease subtyping, particularly in the area of mental health.",Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records,9566983,K01LM012529,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatology', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response', 'treatment response']",NLM,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,187483,0.024017801673830906
"Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization Project summary Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health and criminal justice problem that negatively impacts millions of victims yearly in the United States, primarily women (85%). Most IPV-related healthcare visits (83%) occurred in an emergency department (ED), and these clinical encounters are unique opportunities to identify IPV victims and potentially provide assistance. Although numerous health professional organizations have endorsed universal screening and counseling for IPV since 1992, actual screening rates, detection of IPV victims, and referrals to IPV services remain low in the ED. As a result, many IPV victims pass through the ED unidentified and untreated. Computerized screening tools have been developed and implemented in clinical settings in order to assist providers in screening and detecting IPV. However, these tools have a great limitation in that they rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHR). Recently, researchers demonstrated that a history of IPV diagnoses and associated clinical symptoms highly predict current and future IPV (OR=7.8), and these important IPV data could serve as red flags that trigger providers to assess patients further for IPV. In order to enhance IPV screening in the ED, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summarizer that extracts, abstracts and synthesizes patient historical IPV data (structured and unstructured), and delivers patient historical IPV data to ED providers through an intuitive interface. The specific aims are: 1) develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) strategies to identify and extract patient historical IPV incidents and timelines from clinic notes; 2) develop and evaluate a web service-based summary tool (IPV-Summary-Service) that synthesizes patient- specific IPV information from both NLP-processed data elements and structured data; and 3) develop and pilot test an enhanced IPV screening strategy that delivers clinical evidence generated by the IPV-Summary- Service through a specific EHR (Epic) to providers during the patient universal IPV screening in the ED. This automatic clinical date summary for IPV will be piloted in one ED at MUSC. There are two major outcomes to be measured for the IPV-Summary enhanced screening for 6 months before and after the index date of pilot testing: 1) rate of successful referral to the IPV 24-hour dedicated IPV nurse; and 2) rate of initiation of referral and identification of persons at high risk of IPV. We will use mixed effect generalized linear regression models to estimate the effects of IPV-Summary on the referral rate and IPV case identification rate. Through survey studies, we will assess secondary outcomes including factors of system feasibility, usability, and providers' satisfaction. These analyses can identify potentially important correlates of the major outcomes and may help us improve the design of the intervention. The results from this study will form the foundation for a broader implementation in a regional health information exchange for EDs. Narrative Computer-based approaches for intimate partner violence (IPV) universal screening have led to significantly higher screening rate and detection rate, as well as receipt of IPV services in the emergency department (ED). However, these approaches rely on information collected from the patient and do not utilize the longitudinal IPV data existing in electronic health records (EHR), which have high predictive power of IPV risk. In order to enhance the effectiveness of IPV screening, we propose to develop and assess an automatic clinical data summary tool that extracts, abstracts, and synthesizes patient historical IPV information from EHR and then delivers that critical information to ED providers at the point of care.",Enhancing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Identification through Automated EHR Summarization,9520862,R21LM012945,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Event', 'Face', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Professional', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'South Carolina', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Violent injury', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'intimate partner violence', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability', 'web services']",NLM,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2018,201825,0.06588436110728381

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9537252,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,178606,0.059077826236970485
"Automatic Generation of Computer Interpretable Guidelines PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Compliance with clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) has been demonstrated to markedly improve patient care, but the tools and processes available for physicians to rapidly and meaningfully leverage these guidelines are currently sub-optimal. Compliance improves greatly with the introduction of clinical decision support systems (CDSS), which implement guideline recommendations and are integrated into electronic health record (EHR) systems. Unfortunately, CPGs, as commonly distributed, contain recommendations for care of only a single disorder (or class of disorders) and are not easily consumable by computers for integration with CDSS. Recent work has focused on methods to resolve conflicts between guidelines, but only once they are in a computer interpretable form - a Computer Interpretable Guideline (CIG). We aim: to (1) develop a system for computational understanding of CPGs from the unstructured text; (2) to ground the clinical terms in each guideline in its definition so that the produced CIG can better integrate with electronic health record systems; (3) to generate CIGs in a format already developed which allows guidelines to be mediated with each other and allows the creation of CDSS. The project will focus on four clinical guidelines, relating to diabetes, heart disease, non-small cell lung and prostate cancers. Samples of each of the guidelines will be annotated by clinicians with the appropriate output of systems accomplishing each of the three aims. These samples will be split into datasets for testing and for evaluation, with the overall goal to achieve human levels of competence for each aim. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical practice guidelines are paramount to the goals of evidence-based medicine but, being unstructured free text, they are not well integrated with clinician workflows and are not consistently adhered to. We aim to automatically generate computer interpretable versions of textual guidelines in a format which allows for automatic mediation between guidelines for patients with multiple morbidities. Mediated computer interpretable guidelines could then be integrated with electronic medical record systems, providing immediate impact on population health.",Automatic Generation of Computer Interpretable Guidelines,9654971,R15LM013030,"['Belief', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computer generated', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'novel', 'phrases', 'population health', 'prescription procedure', 'syntax', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NLM,COLLEGE AT OSWEGO,R15,2018,325760,0.02726793065242408
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients.

"EHR-based Genomic Discovery and Implementation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned for genomic discovery and for implementing genomic medicine to improve patient care. In eMERGE I, we leveraged an EHR-linked biobank, high-density genotyping data, and electronic phenotyping algorithms to discover 29 genetic loci associated with cardiovascular traits. In eMERGE II we began implementing genomic medicine by conducting an EHR-based randomized clinical trial of disclosing genomic risk of coronary heart disease and incorporating pharmacogenomic information in the EHR with linkage to clinical decision support. In eMERGE III; we propose to build on our prior work to conduct a genomic medicine implementation project to establish mechanisms for return of actionable findings from targeted sequencing of 100 disease-relevant genes. Focusing on two common genetic disorders-familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial colorectal cancer (CRC)-we will begin to translate genomic discovery and implementation efforts in eMERGE to impact public health. We will obtain informed consent from 3000 participants of Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester MN and Phoenix AZ who have moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps. DNA will be sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 100 disease genes. We will use state-of-the-art methods to classify variant pathogenicity, finalize actionable variants for return, examine near-term outcomes, economic implications and behavioral and psychosocial consequences of such return. We will also conduct genomic discovery leveraging a network-wide data set of ~25,000 individuals with sequence data and an existing network-wide data set of ~50,000 individuals with high-density genotype data linked to the EHR. We will exploit the unique potential of the EHR to assess pleiotropy using novel approaches. In partnership with Mountain Park Health Center, a primary care practice that serves a minority population of Mexican Americans in Phoenix AZ, we will contribute high-density genotyping and phenotype data on 1000 Hispanics for genomic discovery and pilot mechanisms for implementing genomic medicine at this site. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned to discover genetic variants relevant to human health and to implement genomic medicine to improve patient care.

"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 06/09) Page Continuation Format Page PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes innovative intelligent biomedical natural language process approaches to detect ADEs in patients' electronic health records (EHRs), an important step towards ADE surveillance and pharmacovigilance. The focus of this proposal will bon the national priority area of anticoagulants ADE detection, although the algorithms and systems we develop can be extended to other drug classes and diseases. It is anticipated that the data resources, algorithms, and the Anticoagulant Pharmacovigilance Toolkit (APVTK) developed will significantly enhance ADE detection, patient surveillance and post marketing pharmacovigilance.",EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance,9190384,R01HL125089,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulant therapy', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Outcomes Research', 'Package Insert', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data resource', 'disorder prevention', 'dosage', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2017,1177432,0.05851066046754919
"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9254613,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2017,248999,0.07750441072940388
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes.

"Algorithms to Identify Systemic Lupus from Electronic Health Record Data Abstract  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune, multisystem disease that is often difficult to diagnose because of the diverse manifestations that occur over time and across care sites leading to increased damage and early mortality. The personal and economic costs in decreased quality of life and increase in healthcare expenditures, respectively, highlight the critical unmet need to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat lupus, so that treatment or participation in clinical trials occurs as early as possible to mitigate against disease-related damage. Therefore, it is important to find better ways to identify SLE patents.  Electronic health records (EHR) are now used in a majority of health care settings throughout the country, and present a rich source of information about patients which can be mined for earlier diagnosis and identification to improve quality of care, or enable high throughput clinical studies. Despite this potential, to date few accurate algorithms have been developed to identify SLE patients using EHR data. Construction of an effective algorithm, either by rule-based or machine learning methods, requires access to at two data resources not commonly available: 1) a validated “gold standard” patient data set with clear documentation of criteria that are indicative of SLE that can be compared against EHR data and 2) an integrated health record dataset that contains data from multiple health care institutions and reflects that SLE patients receive healthcare at multiple institutions and healthcare providers given their chronic, progressive disease. Over the past several years, our team has created both key resources: the Chicago Lupus Database (CLD), a physician-validated registry of 880 patients and gold standard data set and the Chicago HealthLNK Data Repository (HDR), a regional data resource including integrated medical records for 2.1 million patients across multiple institutions. Jointly, these two datasets enable the creation, testing and validation of algorithms for the identification of SLE in EHR data and provide a more complete picture of a patient population at risk for lupus.  We propose three specific aims to address the need to reduce the time to identify those with SLE in order to initiate treatment in a timelier fashion and to identify candidates for clinical trials. These aims are: 1) To create and validate a series of algorithms to identify SLE patients in EHR data against a gold standard curated registry, CLD, using validated classification criteria for SLE to build concepts for rule-based and machine learning methods that incorporate structured data, laboratory data, and unstructured data, e.g., physician notes, 2) To determine whether identification of SLE patients is improved when algorithms to identify SLE patients are extended to an integrated medical record dataset that includes data from multiple health care institutions, and 3) To use clustering techniques on SLE patients identified from EHR data to isolate clinically distinct sub-populations of patients, which could inform patient selection for participation in clinical trials.

"Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives Project Summary Medicine has evolved into an era where the entire hospital progressively adopts more real-time monitoring for the patients and generates ICU like clinical data. The rapidly growing data makes ICU a snapshot for tomorrow’s standard of care that should benefit from computer-aided decision making. These data contain not only numerical or coded information, but also a large volume of unstructured narrative text such as physicians’ and nurses' notes, specialists' reports, and discharge summaries. Both types of data have been shown to be highly informative for tasks such as cohort selection, and work best in combination. However, to achieve this, specific bits of information must be extracted from the narrative reports and coded in formal representation. These bits include medical concepts such as symptoms, diseases, medications and procedures; characteristics such as certainty, severity, dose; assertions about these items, such as whether they pertain to the patient or a family member, etc.; relations among these mentions, including indications of what condition is treated by what action and its degree of success, the time sequence and duration of events, and interpretations of laboratory test results as relations among medical concepts such as cells and antigens (e.g., “[large atypical cells] express [CD30]”). Concepts and assertions can be regarded as simple relations, and our proposal focuses on modeling narrative relations to augment structured data for predicting patient outcomes. Most existing techniques for interpreting clinical narratives either rely on hand-crafted rule systems and large medical thesauri or are based on machine learning models that create classification or regression models from large annotated data sets. The former are difficult and laborious to generalize, whereas the latter require large volumes of human-labeled data and may result in models whose operation is difficult to interpret and is therefore considered unsuitable for computer-aided decision making. We propose to build on our previous work to use unsupervised learning methods that identify frequent patterns in un-annotated narratives and identify informative patterns by tensor factorization. Although existing methods can also identify patterns that are meaningful in a data-driven sense, these patterns are difficult for clinicians to understand. Our specific goal is to develop a novel method that uses a Bayesian generative model that integrates relation mining with tensor factorization to learn patterns that correspond to an understanding of the clinical domain and can be used for evidence based patient outcome prediction. Our framework represents relations in clinical narratives as graphs, then mines subgraphs for important relations. These relations are used as features in building up a tensor model in order to reduce dimensionality, discover coherent groups of relations, and explore the group interactions. We develop Bayesian formulation to integrate relation mining and tensor modeling in a generative model, to incorporate existing medical knowledge as probability priors, as well as to reliably estimate the posterior probabilities and confidence intervals of any findings from the model. Rapid growth in the hospital adoption of large volume of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has led to an unprecedented availability of narrative dataset for clinical and translational research. We propose the development of a novel Bayesian generative framework to enable extraction of accurate and clinically meaningful patterns of EHR narratives in order to support evidence based diagnostic reasoning and outcome risk prediction.",Bayesian Generative Methods for Extracting and Modeling Relations in EHR Narratives,9374626,R21LM012618,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Appearance', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Assisted', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Family member', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injectable', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Research Council', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TNFRSF8 gene', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'diagnostic panel', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'rapid growth', 'standard of care', 'success']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,208272,0.035201583099285325
"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in is infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems. As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,9332474,R01LM010207,"['Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Interruption', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data access', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward', 'web portal']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,341475,0.0940068806086908
"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9239711,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,735263,0.05957630037087841
"Web Software to develop an RDoC-Compatible Adaptive Diagnostic Nosology, the SID-5 n psychiatry, clinical judgment has been the predominant method of diagnosis. The `gold standard” for clinical research is the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5). The SCID-5 promotes reliability, but its validity is questionable. There is growing recognition that biomarkers can be used to identify more homogeneous patient populations, but there is substantial phenotypic discordance for schizophrenia even in identical twins. In the absence of symptom data, biomarkers alone are unlikely to yield a clinical diagnosis.  In a past SBIR project, TeleSage Inc. successfully converted the paper SCID into a web-based software program. The NetSCID-5 is now widely used in research. Nevertheless, in order to achieve the goal of “turning clinical care networks into centers for research” (Insel, Director's Blog, 2012) and furthering the RDoC initiative, we need a means of gathering rigorous diagnostic data in routine clinical care. This software must (a) require minimal clinician time, (b) allow clinics to bill according to the current DSM-5 categories, and (c) be able to gather the large amount of data necessary to inform a broad research agenda including machine learning techniques. TeleSage proposes to develop a self-report diagnostic assessment that satisfies both immediate clinical needs and broader research goals: the “Screening Interview for Diagnosis” or SID.  TeleSage has worked with an expert panel including Dr. Michael First, the primary author of the SCID- 5, iteratively developing and testing self-report items. Based on expert panel review and cognitive interviewing, we identified a final set of 661 unique self-report, Likert-scale items covering all of the individual sub-symptoms described within each of the SCID criteria. TeleSage has also created a behavioral health PORTAL that includes the NetSCID-5, IRT/CAT item administration, randomization, and longitudinal reporting capabilities. The PORTAL exchanges data and reports with several EHRs including the NetSmart EHR system.  This Direct-to-Phase II application aims to create the SID, which will (a) reside on our existing secure web PORTAL, (b) administer simple Likert-scale self-report items, (c) generate DSM-5 and ICD-10 diagnoses for billing, (d) use minimal clinician time, (e) pull pre-defined data fields from the EHR (e.g. family history, demographic, and biomarker data), (f) be able to add new self-report items for exploration, (g) integrate with machine learning tools, and (h) send raw data and interpretive reports to EHR systems. Because of these features, we believe that the SID has the potential to be used widely by both clinicians and researchers.  The SID is intended to help transcend DSM-5 and to support RDoC. The SID product must be commercially successful and useful both in routine clinical care and research. The SID is intended to facilitate the development and evolution of a new behavioral health nosology based on the aggregation of biomarker and symptom data, a nosology that is more analogous to those found in other fields of medicine. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) represents the current diagnostic gold standard in behavioral health and yields much more reliable diagnoses than the unstructured patient interviews that predominate in clinical settings; however, the full SCID-5 is a lengthy and complex paper-and-pencil instrument that takes approximately 90 minutes to administer and is thus seldom used outside of clinical research settings. We want to create a new, self-report software tool that will save clinicians time relative to the paper SCID, significantly reduce diagnostic error rates, greatly increase the reliability of diagnoses in routine clinical care, and integrate seamlessly into Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems: the Screening Inventory for Diagnosis (SID). The SID is a self-report, computer-adaptive diagnostic assessment, based on easy-to- understand, five-point Likert-scale items. The SID is intended to help transcend DSM-5, support RDoC, and facilitate the development and evolution of a new behavioral health nosology based on the aggregation of biomarker and symptom data.","Web Software to develop an RDoC-Compatible Adaptive Diagnostic Nosology, the SID-5",9255772,R44MH108177,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Brain scan', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'data exchange', 'disease classification', 'epigenetic marker', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'instrument', 'mental health center', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptom cluster', 'tool', 'usability', 'web portal']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R44,2017,433630,0.031844515074627884
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) proposes to contribute as a funded site in the eMERGE III Network by pursuing a series of initiatives designed to advance genomics and the electronic health record (EHR). We propose 100 genes to evaluate by sequencing in 2,000 patients consented for return of results, to advance genomics by evaluating fee for service for DNA sequence-based genetic testing at CCHMC, to develop the reliable identification many diseases in the EHR and along with genome wide genetic testing, to explore genetic variants for alleged and unknown clinical manifestations, to extend the work of eMERGE to other large collections of EHR and genetic data, to evaluate cost benefits of genetic testing, to characterize the genetics of pain, to explor the preferences of adolescents concerning the genetic results they prefer to learn, and to explore the legal, ethical, and social issues that surround the re-interpretation of genetic variants.

"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9332464,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,335217,0.12001917194239468
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2 million patients at Vanderbilt (including 10,000 genotyped statin recipients) to answer these questions.",Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort,9309793,R01HL133786,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Breast', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataract', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Colorectal', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prostate', 'Qi', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer risk', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'glutaryl coA', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,406123,0.05294511478016859
"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values. This work aims to improve our ability to extract useful information from electronic health records to enable disease subtyping, particularly in the area of mental health.",Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records,9453180,K01LM012529,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatology', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response', 'treatment response']",NLM,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,189054,0.024017801673830906
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9331533,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2017,623596,0.0710352050845338
"Novel Informatics Approaches for Ascertainment of PAD Status and Adverse Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant and principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified cardiologist, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Senior Associate Consultant in the Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Division. [The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator in translational informatics focused on the development, validation and deployment of electronic tools to the point-of-care to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. The PI intends to leverage the EHR to conduct population-based studies using electronic algorithms that include NLP and by application of state-of-the-art informatics approaches to deliver the knowledge at the point-of-care in support of patient-centered decision-making for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The electronic tools developed will be portable to different institutions and other health conditions. The PI will be uniquely positioned as a cardiologist within a large academic health system working with novel NLP techniques at the interface of the EHR and CDS to rapidly translate knowledge acquired in community-based epidemiologic investigations to patient care.] The PI has proposed a research career development plan to acquire expertise in translational informatics including electronic phenotyping, and automated calculation and visual display of prognostic scores using a novel application integrated with clinical decision support (CDS). The PI will complete comprehensive coursework in informatics science and gain additional patient-oriented and epidemiologic research experience. The primary mentor will be Iftikhar Kullo, M.D., cardiologist and PI of the Mayo Clinic electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) network and a leader in the development and application of electronic phenotyping for genomic studies of PAD. The mentoring team also includes Dr. Christopher Chute, M.D., Head of Medical Informatics at Mayo Clinic, an expert in informatics and epidemiology, and co-PI of the Mayo eMERGE grant and co-investigator of the Rochester Epidemiology Project; Hongfang Liu, Ph.D., an expert in natural language processing (NLP) and its application for EHR-based phenotyping; and Kent Bailey, Ph.D., senior biostatistician with expertise in development of prognostic risk scores. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1 - Apply phenotyping algorithms that include NLP of clinical notes to [a] identify PAD cases and controls without PAD in the community from 1998-2011; and [b] ascertain adverse cardiovascular and limb outcomes through December 2013. Aim 2 - Create multivariable prognostic risk models and scores for adverse outcomes in PAD cases from the community. We will estimate the relative risk of death in PAD patients compared to controls without PAD. Aim 3 - Develop and evaluate usefulness of a novel electronic application within the Mayo EHR to retrieve relevant data elements, calculate, and display individualized prognostic scores. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and an e-health prognostication tool for PAD patients to be disseminated to stakeholders including clinicians, patients, and researchers portable to other institutions and other cardiovascular diseases.

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9325317,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,178606,0.059077826236970485
"NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department Summary Timely identification of relevant or “need to know” clinical information about a patient’s history in the acute care setting can be critical for patient safety and medical decision-making. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. Currently, it is estimated that over 50% of the EHR is free-text. EHR search tools today are often inefficient, simplistic, and unable to rank or evoke the relevance of information for a particular problem or complaint. This is compounded by the fact that EHRs are amassing clinical information at an exponential rate. While the benefits of having a wealth of information at a provider’s fingertips seem obvious, the time and energy cost of culling through enormous amounts of data creates new issues of decreased efficiency and information overload for providers seeking to identify the most pertinent and relevant information about their patients. In the emergency department, where patients can present with life threatening conditions, timely unlocking of clinically relevant information for a patient’s problem or complaint at the point of care can be critical to medical decision-making and patient safety. In this study, we plan to address this challenge through the development of a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information based on the patients presenting complaint. We will accomplish this through the following specific aims: 1) identify and define complaint- specific information elements within a patient’s history and 2) develop and test an NLP-based information retrieval tool. Narrative Patient safety hinges on having right information about the right patient and the right time. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information from EHRs that providers rely upon to make medical decisions for their patients. This study comes at an important time where data in the EHRs is increasing at an exponential rate, creating a new problem for clinicians, that of finding all the relevant information for patient’s particular problem. This is particularly true in the emergency department setting where providers have limited if any prior relationship and often have to make quick decisions for patients with life threatening conditions. This search tool will provide a snapshot of clinically relevant information that the providers can view alongside the structured information already in the EHR. We believe this approach has the potential to increase clinician efficiency, decrease healthcare costs by avoiding duplicate diagnostic tests, and provide clinicians with the tools they need to make well-informed medical decisions, thereby improving patient safety and reducing suffering.",NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department,9342692,R21HS024541,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2017,148922,0.03423846236881613
"National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms PROJECT SUMMARY With the rapidly growing adoption of patient electronic health record systems (EHRs) due to Meaningful Use, and linkage of EHRs to research biorepositories, evaluating the suitability of EHR data for clinical and translational research is becoming ever more important, with ramifications for genomic and observational research, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness studies. A key component for identifying patient cohorts in the EHR is to define inclusion and exclusion criteria that algorithmically select sets of patients based on stored clinical data. This process is commonly referred to, as “EHR-driven phenotyping” is time-consuming and tedious due to the lack of a widely accepted and standards-based formal information model for defining phenotyping algorithms. To address this overall challenge, the proposed project will design, build and promote an open-access community infrastructure for standards-based development and sharing of phenotyping algorithms, as well as provide tools and resources for investigators, researchers and their informatics support staff to implement and execute the algorithms on native EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of patient cohorts for clinical and genomic research is a costly and time-consuming process. This bottleneck adversely affects public health by delaying research findings, and in some cases by making research costs prohibitively high. To address this issue, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) for identifying patient cohorts has become an increasingly attractive option. This proposal will investigate and implement standards based approaches for computable phenotype identification from multiple EHRs.",National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms,9381197,R01GM105688,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Flowcharts', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Needs Assessment', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'University Hospitals', 'authority', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'database query', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics training', 'information model', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'repository', 'syntax', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2017,745771,0.13775121907952223
"Automated Problem and Allergy Lists Enrichment Based on High Accuracy Information Extraction from the Electronic Health Record ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposed a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer, and established its feasibility. To advance this new system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the commercial EHR system used in our implementation and testing site (Huntsman Cancer Institute and University of Utah Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah), and ready for commercialization efforts, we will work on the following aims: 1) enhance the NLP system performance, scalability, and quality, 2) develop an advanced visualization interface for local adaptation of the NLP system, and 3) integrate the NLP system with a commercial EHR system. A large and varied reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application will also be developed, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and at the University of Utah Hospital (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services incentive payments. Clinacuity will further extend the commercial potential of the system and its output, using modular design principles allowing utilization of each module independently, and enhancing its local adaptability for easier deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical errors cause numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many could be prevented. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information such as entries in electronic lists of problems and allergies. Such lists are available in most electronic health records, but they require manual management and are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date.

"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients.

"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem.

"Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient information in the electronic health record (EHR) such as lab results, medications, and past medical history is the basis for physician decisions about patient care. It also helps patients better understand and manage their care. Efficient access to this patient information is thus essential. One of the most intuitive ways of accessing data is by asking natural language questions. A significant amount of work in medical question answering has been conducted, yet little work has been performed in question answering for EHRs. Natural language questions can be represented in logical forms, a standard structured knowledge representation technique. This project proposes to take natural language EHR questions, both for doctors and patients, and automatically convert them to a logical form. The logical forms can then be converted to a structured query such as those used by EHRs. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of data containing questions annotated with logical forms. This project hypothesizes that a small set of questions can be manually annotated, and then paraphrases can be produced for each annotated question. Since paraphrasing is a simpler task than logical form annotation, crowd-sourcing techniques can be used to collect thousands of question paraphrases. This question paraphrase corpus will then be used to build a semantic grammar capable of recognizing the logical structure of EHR questions. To ensure a robust, generalizable grammar, existing NLP techniques will be used to pre-process questions, simplifying their syntactic structure and abstracting their medical concepts.     In order to develop such a method, the candidate, Dr. Kirk Roberts, requires additional training and mentoring in natural language processing and biomedical informatics. This application for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) describes a career development plan that will allow Dr. Roberts to achieve the goals of this project as well as transition to a career as an independent researcher. He will be mentored by Dr. Dina Demner-Fushman, a leading medical NLP researcher, and co-mentored by Dr. Clement McDonald, a leading EHR and medical informatics researcher.     The specific aims of the project are: (1) Build a paraphrase collection of EHR questions, where each prototype question will have many unique paraphrases. The paraphrases encompass different lexical and syntactic means of conveying the same logical form. (2) Construct a semantic grammar for EHR questions. The grammar can then be used to convert a natural language question to a logical form. (3) Implement an end- to-end question analyzer that generalizes EHR questions for improved parsing, parses the question into a logical form using the grammar, and converts the logical form into a leading structured EHR query format. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work aims to significantly improve the ability of both doctors and patients to find information within electronic health records (EHR). By providing an interface to EHRs where users can specify their information needs in the form of a natural language question, the proposed work provides a more intuitive means of finding patient data than is currently available.",Natural Language Question Understanding for Electronic Health Records,9228509,R00LM012104,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Blood Glucose', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'crowdsourcing', 'data access', 'database structure', 'design', 'health data', 'illiterate', 'improved', 'information organization', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'open source', 'operation', 'phrases', 'prototype', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2016,249000,0.07750441072940388
"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in is infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems. As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,9143798,R01LM010207,"['Accounting', 'Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data access', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward', 'web portal']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,341475,0.0940068806086908

"Use Frailty Status to Predict Postoperative Outcomes in Elderly Patient Frailty is increasingly recognized as a leading indicator of poor health outcomes, even death, as well as a barometer of how well patients respond to treatment. To truly provide patient-centered care, providers should be aware of each patient's frailty status and incorporate it into clinical decision making. Providers can now offer a number of invasive and aggressive procedures for cardiovascular disease, which involve risk, and can be painful. The treatment intensity need to match the expected patient outcome, yet providers do not have a reliable method to estimate prognosis for frail patients. In the study proposed here, we will use a novel approach that leverages the electronic health record (EHR) in identifying patient frailty status, with the goal of supporting retrospective clinical studies and prospective clinical decision making. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated the availability of frailty-related findings in EHR, the feasibility of extracting frailty findings, and the feasibility of using EHR-extracted frailty for outcome prediction. The specific aims of the project are to 1) Create a frailty ontology building on existing functional status and quality of life measurements; 2) Develop ontology guided, natural language processing (NLP) methods for extracting frailty descriptions and measurements; 3) Develop a model to aggregate NLP-extracted frailty findings to generate a patient-level frailty score; 4) Examine the all-cause mortality and all-cause hospital readmission one year after major cardiac procedures in heart failure patients with different frailty scores and assess the impact of this information on surgical decision making. Frailty is an important, but often overlooked, determinant of health outcomes in older adults. Providers can now offer invasive and aggressive treatments for various conditions, but these interventions involve risk and careful patient selection that balances risk and benefit is imperative. We will develop automated methods to extract frailty information from clinical records and generate an aggregated frailty score, which will enable retrospective analyses of EHR data for risk prediction and support prospective clinical decisional making.",Use Frailty Status to Predict Postoperative Outcomes in Elderly Patient,9354376,R56AG052536,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caregivers', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equilibrium', 'Fatigue', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Technology', 'Veterans', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'exercise capacity', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'treatment choice', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NIA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R56,2016,616197,0.043762676592750634
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",9115724,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'tool', 'trend analysis']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2016,335217,0.12001917194239468
"Clinical Text Automatic De-Identification to Support Large Scale Data Reuse and Sharing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is growing at a fast pace in the U.S., and this growth results in very large quantities of patient clinical data becoming available in electronic format, with tremendous potentials, but also equally growing concern for patient confidentiality breaches. Secondary use of clinical data is essential to fulfill the potentials for high quality healthcare, improved healthcare management, and effective clinical research. NIH expects that larger research projects share their research data in a way that protects the confidentiality of the research subjects. De-identification of patient data has been proposed as a solution to both facilitate secondary uses of clinical data, and protect patient data confidentiality. The majority of clinical data found in the EHR is represented as narrative text clinical notes, and de-identification of clinical text is a tedious ad costly manual endeavor. Automated approaches based on Natural Language Processing have been implemented and evaluated, allowing for much faster de- identification than manual approaches. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to develop a new system to automatically de-identify clinical notes found in the EHR, to then improve the availability of clinical text for secondary uses, as well as ameliorate the protection of patient data confidentiality. To establish the merit and feasibility of such a system, we will work on the following objectives: 1) create a reference standard for training and testing the text de-identification application, a reference standard that will include a random sample of clinical narratives with protected health information annotated by domain experts; 2) develop a prototype to automatically de-identify clinical text in near real-time, a prototype that will implement a novel stepwise hybrid approach to maximize sensitivity first (our priority for de-identification), and then filter out false positives to enhance positive predictive value, and also replace PHI with realistic substitutes for improved protection; and 3) test the prototype with the aforementioned reference standard, using a cross-validation approach for training and testing, and also train and test the prototype with a reference standard from another healthcare organization. Commercial application: To strengthen patient information confidentiality protection, the HITECH Act heightened financial penalties incurred for breaches of PHI, even introducing criminal penalties. These new severe consequences for violation of patient information confidentiality render protection requirements even more obvious, and automatic high-accuracy clinical text de-identification, as offered by the system Clinacuity proposes, will strongly help healthcare and clinical research organizations avoid such consequences. This system has potential commercial applications in clinical research and in healthcare settings. It will improve access to richer, more detailed, and more accurate clinical data (in clinical text) for clinical researchers. It will also ease research data sharing, and help healthcare organizations protect patient data confidentiality.

"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.            ",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9094161,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2016,652772,0.0710352050845338
"SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs)  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smart algorithms that effectively analyze patient care data can enhance clinical communication to save lives. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine estimated 98,000 preventable patient deaths occur annually in US hospitals due to miscommunication [1]. Electronic health records (EHRs) were expected to facilitate accurate communication within the care team and provide data to enable automated clinical decision support systems. Unfortunately, miscommunication remains a significant cause of patient deaths [2]. Providers are now required to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR systems to improve quality of care and patient outcomes. Despite this, providers continue to report that EHR systems are cumbersome and interfere with care-team communication. Information entered into an EHR is rarely used by nurses due to the time and difficulty involved in its retrieval. As a result, nurses continue to verbally convey critical patient care information to the next nurse during shift changes. Verbal report or hand-off, where critical patient information is exchanged in only minutes, is inefficient. Worse, it is highly susceptible to communication errors. Broader Impacts: Research: 1) Increase patient safety; 2) Provide preliminary data to expand this work to include physician-physician and physician-RN communication and decision-making in the EHR; 3) Share our discoveries to inform other industries who may also benefit from this technology. Education: 1) Contribute to curriculum enhancements whereby RN students learn strategies to recognize and effectively communicate CEs; 2) As part of curriculum enhancements, include healthcare applications for computer and information science students; 3) Disseminate findings via academic publications, professional meetings, a project website and social media. Mentoring: 1) Mentor budding scientists in the roles of research assistants (RAs) and post doctoral fellows studying nursing and computer science to forge collaborative interdisciplinary relationships for ongoing research; 2) Interest and recruit underrepresented students in STEM and careers in healthcare. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The electronic health record (EHR) has been thought to be a tool to decrease patient deaths related to miscommunication.

"Novel Informatics Approaches for Ascertainment of PAD Status and Adverse Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant and principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified cardiologist, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Senior Associate Consultant in the Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Division. [The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator in translational informatics focused on the development, validation and deployment of electronic tools to the point-of-care to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. The PI intends to leverage the EHR to conduct population-based studies using electronic algorithms that include NLP and by application of state-of-the-art informatics approaches to deliver the knowledge at the point-of-care in support of patient-centered decision-making for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The electronic tools developed will be portable to different institutions and other health conditions. The PI will be uniquely positioned as a cardiologist within a large academic health system working with novel NLP techniques at the interface of the EHR and CDS to rapidly translate knowledge acquired in community-based epidemiologic investigations to patient care.] The PI has proposed a research career development plan to acquire expertise in translational informatics including electronic phenotyping, and automated calculation and visual display of prognostic scores using a novel application integrated with clinical decision support (CDS). The PI will complete comprehensive coursework in informatics science and gain additional patient-oriented and epidemiologic research experience. The primary mentor will be Iftikhar Kullo, M.D., cardiologist and PI of the Mayo Clinic electronic MEdical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) network and a leader in the development and application of electronic phenotyping for genomic studies of PAD. The mentoring team also includes Dr. Christopher Chute, M.D., Head of Medical Informatics at Mayo Clinic, an expert in informatics and epidemiology, and co-PI of the Mayo eMERGE grant and co-investigator of the Rochester Epidemiology Project; Hongfang Liu, Ph.D., an expert in natural language processing (NLP) and its application for EHR-based phenotyping; and Kent Bailey, Ph.D., senior biostatistician with expertise in development of prognostic risk scores. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1 - Apply phenotyping algorithms that include NLP of clinical notes to [a] identify PAD cases and controls without PAD in the community from 1998-2011; and [b] ascertain adverse cardiovascular and limb outcomes through December 2013. Aim 2 - Create multivariable prognostic risk models and scores for adverse outcomes in PAD cases from the community. We will estimate the relative risk of death in PAD patients compared to controls without PAD. Aim 3 - Develop and evaluate usefulness of a novel electronic application within the Mayo EHR to retrieve relevant data elements, calculate, and display individualized prognostic scores. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and an e-health prognostication tool for PAD patients to be disseminated to stakeholders including clinicians, patients, and researchers portable to other institutions and other cardiovascular diseases.

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9147612,K01ES026837,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'research facility', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,178606,0.059077826236970485
"NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department Summary Timely identification of relevant or “need to know” clinical information about a patient’s history in the acute care setting can be critical for patient safety and medical decision-making. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. Currently, it is estimated that over 50% of the EHR is free-text. EHR search tools today are often inefficient, simplistic, and unable to rank or evoke the relevance of information for a particular problem or complaint. This is compounded by the fact that EHRs are amassing clinical information at an exponential rate. While the benefits of having a wealth of information at a provider’s fingertips seem obvious, the time and energy cost of culling through enormous amounts of data creates new issues of decreased efficiency and information overload for providers seeking to identify the most pertinent and relevant information about their patients. In the emergency department, where patients can present with life threatening conditions, timely unlocking of clinically relevant information for a patient’s problem or complaint at the point of care can be critical to medical decision-making and patient safety. In this study, we plan to address this challenge through the development of a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information based on the patients presenting complaint. We will accomplish this through the following specific aims: 1) identify and define complaint- specific information elements within a patient’s history and 2) develop and test an NLP-based information retrieval tool. Narrative Patient safety hinges on having right information about the right patient and the right time. Often the relevant information is buried in unstructured or free-text narratives within the Electronic Health Record (EHR), making it difficult to access in a timely fashion. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) search tool to automatically identify and rank clinically relevant information from EHRs that providers rely upon to make medical decisions for their patients. This study comes at an important time where data in the EHRs is increasing at an exponential rate, creating a new problem for clinicians, that of finding all the relevant information for patient’s particular problem. This is particularly true in the emergency department setting where providers have limited if any prior relationship and often have to make quick decisions for patients with life threatening conditions. This search tool will provide a snapshot of clinically relevant information that the providers can view alongside the structured information already in the EHR. We believe this approach has the potential to increase clinician efficiency, decrease healthcare costs by avoiding duplicate diagnostic tests, and provide clinicians with the tools they need to make well-informed medical decisions, thereby improving patient safety and reducing suffering.",NLP to Identify and Rank Clinically Relevant Information for EHRs in the Emergency Department,9245525,R21HS024541,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2016,148922,0.03423846236881613
"Automated Problem and Allergy Lists Enrichment Based on High Accuracy Information Extraction from the Electronic Health Record ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposed a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer, and established its feasibility. To advance this new system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the commercial EHR system used in our implementation and testing site (Huntsman Cancer Institute and University of Utah Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah), and ready for commercialization efforts, we will work on the following aims: 1) enhance the NLP system performance, scalability, and quality, 2) develop an advanced visualization interface for local adaptation of the NLP system, and 3) integrate the NLP system with a commercial EHR system. A large and varied reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application will also be developed, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and at the University of Utah Hospital (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services incentive payments. Clinacuity will further extend the commercial potential of the system and its output, using modular design principles allowing utilization of each module independently, and enhancing its local adaptability for easier deployment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical errors cause numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many could be prevented.

Such lists are available in most electronic health records, but they require manual management and are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. On the other hand, clinical text reports contain the majority of the patient information, including problems and allergies.

"EHR-based Genomic Discovery and Implementation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned for genomic discovery and for implementing genomic medicine to improve patient care. In eMERGE I, we leveraged an EHR-linked biobank, high-density genotyping data, and electronic phenotyping algorithms to discover 29 genetic loci associated with cardiovascular traits. In eMERGE II we began implementing genomic medicine by conducting an EHR-based randomized clinical trial of disclosing genomic risk of coronary heart disease and incorporating pharmacogenomic information in the EHR with linkage to clinical decision support. In eMERGE III; we propose to build on our prior work to conduct a genomic medicine implementation project to establish mechanisms for return of actionable findings from targeted sequencing of 100 disease-relevant genes. Focusing on two common genetic disorders-familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial colorectal cancer (CRC)-we will begin to translate genomic discovery and implementation efforts in eMERGE to impact public health. We will obtain informed consent from 3000 participants of Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester MN and Phoenix AZ who have moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps.

"EHR Anticoagulants Pharmacovigilance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely identification of previously unknown toxicities of cardiovascular drugs is an important, unsolved problem. In the United States, 20% of the 548 drugs introduced into the market between 1975 and 1999 were either withdrawn or acquired a new ""black box"" warning during the 25-year period following initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse drug events (ADEs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 95% of ADEs are unreported, leading to delays in the detection of previously unknown ADEs and underestimation of the risk to known ADEs. It is known that Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes and lab results contain ADE information and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) provides automated tools that facilitate chart review and thus improve patient surveillance and post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Optimal use of anticoagulants requires accurate and timely detection of ADEs from EHRs. The objectives for this proposal are to develop ""intelligent"" NLP approaches to extract disease, medication, and structured ADE information from EHRs, and then evaluate extracted ADEs for detecting known ADE types as well as clinically unrecognized or novel ADEs whose pattern or effect have not been previously identified.

"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in is infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems. As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,8882547,R01LM010207,"['Accounting', 'Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,80,0.0940068806086908
"Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) prevalence has increased and will continue so over the next 30 years with a profound individual and societal burden. Early detection of HF may be useful in mitigating this burden. The purpose of this proposal is to develop robust predictive models that make use of longitudinal electronic health record (EHR). Our long term goal is to use such models to detect HF at an earlier stage (e.g., AHA/ACA Stages A or B) than usually occurs in primary care. We have completed extensive preliminary work using 10 years of longitudinal EHR data on primary care patients. Using text mining and machine learning tools we have found that Framingham criteria are documented in the EHR long before more specific diagnostic studies are done. These symptoms are considerably more common among incident HF cases than controls two to four years before diagnosis. Moreover, clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and other data routinely captured in the EHR predicts future HF diagnosis. We propose to extend this work on early detection of HF with the following aims: 1) To develop more sensitive and specific criteria for use of Framingham HF signs and symptoms in the early detection of HF. We have shown that positive and negative affirmation of Framingham signs and symptoms are useful in HF detection 1-4 years before diagnosis. We propose to address the following: a) Which Framingham signs and symptoms and combinations thereof are most useful for early detection? b) Are there temporal sequences and correlations among signs and symptoms that improve accuracy of detection? c) How do the criteria vary by HF subtype? We hypothesize that analysis of routinely documented signs and symptoms data will yield a clinically meaningful improvement in the accuracy of detecting HF 1 to 2 years before actual diagnosis; 2) To determine the differential improvement in accuracy of predicting diagnosis of HF by combining common fixed field EHR data with text data to improve early detection of HF. Our preliminary work indicates that longitudinal EHR data (e.g., clinical, laboratory, health behaviors, diagnoses, use of care, etc) are useful in predicting future HF diagnosis. Based on these findings, we recognize an increasingly sophisticated analysis will be required to identify how to use these data to optimize predictive power. We hypothesize that the specific models and the performance of these models will vary by HF subtypes of HF; 3) To determine how digital ECG related measures can be used alone and in combination with other data to improve early detection of HF. Real time access to digital ECG data affords unique opportunities to extract a diversity of measures that may be useful in primary care in the early detection of HF; and 4) To develop preliminary operational protocols for early detection of HF in primary care. We will need to consider how the output from the model can be used to support clinical guidance and shared decision-making. Moreover, models need to be developed for data rich and data poor settings. The long term goal of the proposed work is relevant to the national priority for adoption of EHRs in clinical practice and for meaningful use of such technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart Failure (HF) strikes one in 5 US citizens over age 40, has a profound impact on health, and is almost always detected too late to allow doctors to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose to use sophisticated analytic tools to search through electronic health records of patients for early signals of HF. The long term goal of our work is to use such tools to detect HF early enough to allow doctors to change the course of disease and substantially reduce HF morbidity and the risk of death.",Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care,8824963,R01HL116832,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee Strikes', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'body system', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid growth', 'shared decision making', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R01,2015,461213,0.03570343420714451
"Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) proposes to contribute as a funded site in the eMERGE III Network by pursuing a series of initiatives designed to advance genomics and the electronic health record (EHR). We propose 100 genes to evaluate by sequencing in 2,000 patients consented for return of results, to advance genomics by evaluating fee for service for DNA sequence-based genetic testing at CCHMC, to develop the reliable identification many diseases in the EHR and along with genome wide genetic testing, to explore genetic variants for alleged and unknown clinical manifestations, to extend the work of eMERGE to other large collections of EHR and genetic data, to evaluate cost benefits of genetic testing, to characterize the genetics of pain, to explor the preferences of adolescents concerning the genetic results they prefer to learn, and to explore the legal, ethical, and social issues that surround the re-interpretation of genetic variants. All of this work will be pursued with our eMERGE III Network colleagues the goal of improving the quality of the health care we deliver.                ",Better Outcomes for Children: Promoting Excellence in Healthcare Genomics to Inform Policy,8967443,U01HG008666,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Appendicitis', 'Archives', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Boston', 'Budgets', 'CYP3A5 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'Cost Analysis', 'Costs and Benefits', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Analysis', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Learning', 'Legal Obligations', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant hyperpyrexia due to anesthesia', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Methylphenidate', 'Migraine', 'Modification', 'Mosaicism', 'Narcotic Addiction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outpatients', 'PTEN gene', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Pyloric Stenosis', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Tonsillectomy', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'design', 'economic impact', 'electronic data', 'ethical legal social implication', 'follow-up', 'gene panel', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic variation', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'interest', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'pleiotropism', 'preference', 'primary pulmonary hypertension', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development']",NHGRI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,U01,2015,855289,0.12802144175460678
"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted. Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Accelerating the pace at which patients are recruited into clinical trials has the potential for improving the speed at which new treatments are made available to the public.",An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records,8906937,R01LM011116,"['Address', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'falls', 'health record', 'improved', 'screening']",NLM,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,297811,0.07609365157018803
"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported. Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",8911361,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2015,325159,0.12001917194239468
"SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs)  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smart algorithms that effectively analyze patient care data can enhance clinical communication to save lives. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine estimated 98,000 preventable patient deaths occur annually in US hospitals due to miscommunication [1]. Electronic health records (EHRs) were expected to facilitate accurate communication within the care team and provide data to enable automated clinical decision support systems. Unfortunately, miscommunication remains a significant cause of patient deaths [2]. Providers are now required to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR systems to improve quality of care and patient outcomes. Despite this, providers continue to report that EHR systems are cumbersome and interfere with care-team communication. Information entered into an EHR is rarely used by nurses due to the time and difficulty involved in its retrieval. As a result, nurses continue to verbally convey critical patient care information to the next nurse during shift changes. Verbal report or hand-off, where critical patient information is exchanged in only minutes, is inefficient. Worse, it is highly susceptible to communication errors. Broader Impacts: Research: 1) Increase patient safety; 2) Provide preliminary data to expand this work to include physician-physician and physician-RN communication and decision-making in the EHR; 3) Share our discoveries to inform other industries who may also benefit from this technology. Education: 1) Contribute to curriculum enhancements whereby RN students learn strategies to recognize and effectively communicate CEs; 2) As part of curriculum enhancements, include healthcare applications for computer and information science students; 3) Disseminate findings via academic publications, professional meetings, a project website and social media. Mentoring: 1) Mentor budding scientists in the roles of research assistants (RAs) and post doctoral fellows studying nursing and computer science to forge collaborative interdisciplinary relationships for ongoing research; 2) Interest and recruit underrepresented students in STEM and careers in healthcare. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The electronic health record (EHR) has been thought to be a tool to decrease patient deaths related to miscommunication. However, the current EHR falls short of this goal. We propose to develop and test an algorithm that will augment the EHR to more effectively assist nurses in decision-making and communication, ultimately increasing patient safety.",SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs) ,8932003,R01EB020395,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'STEM career', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underrepresented Students', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'computer science', 'falls', 'forging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'light weight', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'social', 'tool', 'usability', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2015,248507,0.08112969556671326
"Novel Informatics Approaches for Ascertainment of PAD Status and Adverse Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant and principal investigator (PI) is a board-certified cardiologist, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Senior Associate Consultant in the Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Division. [The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator in translational informatics focused on the development, validation and deployment of electronic tools to the point-of-care to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease.

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.                ",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9044538,K01ES026837,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,178606,0.059077826236970485
"EHR-based Genomic Discovery and Implementation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned for genomic discovery and for implementing genomic medicine to improve patient care. In eMERGE I, we leveraged an EHR-linked biobank, high-density genotyping data, and electronic phenotyping algorithms to discover 29 genetic loci associated with cardiovascular traits. In eMERGE II we began implementing genomic medicine by conducting an EHR-based randomized clinical trial of disclosing genomic risk of coronary heart disease and incorporating pharmacogenomic information in the EHR with linkage to clinical decision support. In eMERGE III; we propose to build on our prior work to conduct a genomic medicine implementation project to establish mechanisms for return of actionable findings from targeted sequencing of 100 disease-relevant genes. Focusing on two common genetic disorders-familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial colorectal cancer (CRC)-we will begin to translate genomic discovery and implementation efforts in eMERGE to impact public health. We will obtain informed consent from 3000 participants of Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester MN and Phoenix AZ who have moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps. DNA will be sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 100 disease genes. We will use state-of-the-art methods to classify variant pathogenicity, finalize actionable variants for return, examine near-term outcomes, economic implications and behavioral and psychosocial consequences of such return. We will also conduct genomic discovery leveraging a network-wide data set of ~25,000 individuals with sequence data and an existing network-wide data set of ~50,000 individuals with high-density genotype data linked to the EHR. We will exploit the unique potential of the EHR to assess pleiotropy using novel approaches. In partnership with Mountain Park Health Center, a primary care practice that serves a minority population of Mexican Americans in Phoenix AZ, we will contribute high-density genotyping and phenotype data on 1000 Hispanics for genomic discovery and pilot mechanisms for implementing genomic medicine at this site.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned to discover genetic variants relevant to human health and to implement genomic medicine to improve patient care.

"Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records  Health information technology (HIT) can lower costs, strengthen productivity, and promote safety. To realize such benefits on a large scale, healthcare organizations (HCOs) are adopting electronic health records (EHRs) to provide various capabilities. Yet, as EHRs and the healthcare workforce grow in diversity, so does their complexity. This is a concern because evidence suggests complex HIT can interrupt care delivery, contribute to medical errors, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. Moreover, such events tend to be discovered only after they transpire en masse, leading to negative media coverage, loss of patients' trust, and sanctions. Federal regulations now enable patients to receive accountings of who accessed their medical records during treatment, payment, and operations related activities. Yet, for patients to make sense of such accountings, they need to be provided with explanations regarding the extent to which accesses are normal in the context of routine HCO activities. We believe that relating specific accesses to patterns of healthcare operations can help explain how medical records are utilized. Unfortunately, many of the aforementioned problems manifest because EHR utilization patterns rarely guide the design and refinement of healthcare management practices. Thus, the overarching objective of our research is to develop novel strategies to automatically learn HCO behavior based on EHR usage. The past several years has witnessed a flurry of activity in this field, but it remains in its infancy and has only scratched the surface of care patterns and the types of anomalies that can be detected. Through this project, we propose to develop anomaly detection methods that integrate the semantics of healthcare operations and allow for the detection of workflows over time. This will enable HCOs and patients to audit in a meaningful way. Moreover, we believe the innovation and dissemination of such data mining strategies will enable HCOs to detect anomalous events that indicate system misuse and patients who require special attention, but also effectively audit business practices and discover inefficient workflows. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop machine learning approaches, based on intrasession utilization patterns, to streamline EHR interface configuration and detect anomalous sessions, (2) to design a data mining framework, based on intersession EHR access patterns, to characterize HCO departmental interactions in patient treatment and detect anomalous events, and (3) to infer patient management pathways to consolidate redundant processes and detect deviations from anticipated workflows. In support of these goals, we will evaluate, compare, and contrast the workflows and anomalies in the EHR systems of two large medical centers. Additionally, we will ensure that our methods are integrated into an open source software system that can assist HCOs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) access data from EHRs, analyze such data for anomalies, and visualize the results in interfaces that enable review by healthcare administrators and patients. In doing so, we will be able to compare and contrast behavior of the workflows and multiple institutions and develop methods that appropriately generalize across EHR systems.  As electronic health record systems, and healthcare organizations, grow in diversity, so do their complexity, which can lead to inefficient documentation, management of patients, and expose patient data to privacy breaches. In this research, we will develop technologies, to be disseminated through an open source software suite, to learn patterns associated with healthcare operations, upon which anomaly detection techniques can be based. The specific goals of this project are to 1) model HCO users' intrasession behaviors when interacting with an EHR, 2) learn interdepartmental relations based on the accesses of common patients, and 3) infer patient management pathways based on the sequence of accesses to a patient's record.",Automated Detection of Anomalous Accesses to Electronic Health Records,8694383,R01LM010207,"['Accounting', 'Administrator', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Interdepartmental Relations', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Neonatal Intensive Care', 'Neonatology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Phase', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Semantics', 'Simulate', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'comparative', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health information technology', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'payment', 'programs', 'software systems', 'ward']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,392500,0.09373553582952845
"Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) prevalence has increased and will continue so over the next 30 years with a profound individual and societal burden. Early detection of HF may be useful in mitigating this burden. The purpose of this proposal is to develop robust predictive models that make use of longitudinal electronic health record (EHR). Our long term goal is to use such models to detect HF at an earlier stage (e.g., AHA/ACA Stages A or B) than usually occurs in primary care. We have completed extensive preliminary work using 10 years of longitudinal EHR data on primary care patients. Using text mining and machine learning tools we have found that Framingham criteria are documented in the EHR long before more specific diagnostic studies are done. These symptoms are considerably more common among incident HF cases than controls two to four years before diagnosis. Moreover, clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and other data routinely captured in the EHR predicts future HF diagnosis. We propose to extend this work on early detection of HF with the following aims: 1) To develop more sensitive and specific criteria for use of Framingham HF signs and symptoms in the early detection of HF. We have shown that positive and negative affirmation of Framingham signs and symptoms are useful in HF detection 1-4 years before diagnosis. We propose to address the following: a) Which Framingham signs and symptoms and combinations thereof are most useful for early detection? b) Are there temporal sequences and correlations among signs and symptoms that improve accuracy of detection? c) How do the criteria vary by HF subtype? We hypothesize that analysis of routinely documented signs and symptoms data will yield a clinically meaningful improvement in the accuracy of detecting HF 1 to 2 years before actual diagnosis; 2) To determine the differential improvement in accuracy of predicting diagnosis of HF by combining common fixed field EHR data with text data to improve early detection of HF. Our preliminary work indicates that longitudinal EHR data (e.g., clinical, laboratory, health behaviors, diagnoses, use of care, etc) are useful in predicting future HF diagnosis. Based on these findings, we recognize an increasingly sophisticated analysis will be required to identify how to use these data to optimize predictive power. We hypothesize that the specific models and the performance of these models will vary by HF subtypes of HF; 3) To determine how digital ECG related measures can be used alone and in combination with other data to improve early detection of HF. Real time access to digital ECG data affords unique opportunities to extract a diversity of measures that may be useful in primary care in the early detection of HF; and 4) To develop preliminary operational protocols for early detection of HF in primary care. We will need to consider how the output from the model can be used to support clinical guidance and shared decision-making. Moreover, models need to be developed for data rich and data poor settings. The long term goal of the proposed work is relevant to the national priority for adoption of EHRs in clinical practice and for meaningful use of such technology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart Failure (HF) strikes one in 5 US citizens over age 40, has a profound impact on health, and is almost always detected too late to allow doctors to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose to use sophisticated analytic tools to search through electronic health records of patients for early signals of HF. The long term goal of our work is to use such tools to detect HF early enough to allow doctors to change the course of disease and substantially reduce HF morbidity and the risk of death.                ",Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care,8652345,R01HL116832,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee Strikes', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'body system', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'shared decision making', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R01,2014,527741,0.03570343420714451
"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.                  Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials.

"Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of developing tools for automatically harvesting temporal constraints of clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. Efficient analysis of the temporal aspects in EHR data could boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine.     One big challenge we are facing is to automatically untangle and linearize the temporal constraints of clinical events embedded in highly diverse large-scale EHR data. Barriers to temporal data modeling, normalization, extraction, and reasoning have precluded the efficient use of EHR data sources for event history evaluation and trending analysis: (1) The current federally-supported EHR data normalization tools do not focus on the time aspect of unstructured data yet; (2) Existing time models focus only on structured data with absolute time, lack of supporting reasoning systems, or only offer application-specific partial solutions which cannot be adopted by the complex EHR data; (3) Current temporal information extraction approaches are either difficult to be adopted to EHR data, not scalable, or only offers application-specific partial solution.     This proposed project fills in the current gaps among ontologies, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and EHR-based clinical research for temporal data representation, normalization, extractions, and reasoning. We propose to develop novel approaches for automatic temporal data representation, normalization and reasoning for large, diverse, and heterogeneous EHR data and prepare the integrated data for further analysis. We will build new reasoning and extraction capacities on our TIMER (Temporal Information Modeling, Extracting, and Reasoning) framework to provide an end-to-end, open-source, standard-conforming software package. TIMER will be built on strong prior work by our team. We will develop new features in our CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) for semantically defining the time domain and representing temporal data in complex EHR data. On top of the new developed CNTRO semantics, we will implement temporal relation reasoning capacities to automatically normalize temporal expressions, compute and infer temporal relations, and resolve ambiguities. We will leverage existing NLP tools and work on top of these tools to develop new extraction approaches to fill in the current gaps between NLP approaches and ontology-based reasoning approaches. We will adapt the SHARPn EHR data normalization pipeline and cTAKES for extracting and normalizing clinical event mentions from clinical narratives. We will explore an innovative approach for temporal relation extraction and event coreference, and make it work with the TIMER framework. We will evaluate the system using Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohorts from two insititutions. Each component will be tested separately first followed by an evaluation of the whole framework. Results such as precision, recall, and f-measure will be reported.                 Project Narrative The significance of developing capabilities for automatically harvesting temporal constraints for clinical events from Electronic Health Records (EHR) cannot be overestimated. A substantial portion of the information in the EHR is historical in nature. Patient medical history can be long, especially in complex patients. The proposed work, by offering an end-to-end open-source framework for automatically extracting, normalizing, and reasoning clinically-important time-relevant information from large-scale EHR data, can boost an array of clinical and translational research such as disease progression studies, decision support systems, and personalized medicine; as well as facilitate clinical practice for early disease detection, post-treatment care, and patient-clinician communication.","Patient Medical History Representation, Extraction, and Inference from EHR Data",8760594,R01LM011829,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Aftercare', 'Archives', 'Automated Annotation', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Harvest', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'data structure', 'information model', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'programs', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2014,398307,0.12001917194239468
"SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs)  ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smart algorithms that effectively analyze patient care data can enhance clinical communication to save lives. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine estimated 98,000 preventable patient deaths occur annually in US hospitals due to miscommunication [1]. Electronic health records (EHRs) were expected to facilitate accurate communication within the care team and provide data to enable automated clinical decision support systems. Unfortunately, miscommunication remains a significant cause of patient deaths [2]. Providers are now required to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR systems to improve quality of care and patient outcomes. Despite this, providers continue to report that EHR systems are cumbersome and interfere with care-team communication. Information entered into an EHR is rarely used by nurses due to the time and difficulty involved in its retrieval. As a result, nurses continue to verbally convey critical patient care information to the next nurse during shift changes. Verbal report or hand-off, where critical patient information is exchanged in only minutes, is inefficient. Worse, it is highly susceptible to communication errors. Broader Impacts: Research: 1) Increase patient safety; 2) Provide preliminary data to expand this work to include physician-physician and physician-RN communication and decision-making in the EHR; 3) Share our discoveries to inform other industries who may also benefit from this technology. Education: 1) Contribute to curriculum enhancements whereby RN students learn strategies to recognize and effectively communicate CEs; 2) As part of curriculum enhancements, include healthcare applications for computer and information science students; 3) Disseminate findings via academic publications, professional meetings, a project website and social media. Mentoring: 1) Mentor budding scientists in the roles of research assistants (RAs) and post doctoral fellows studying nursing and computer science to forge collaborative interdisciplinary relationships for ongoing research; 2) Interest and recruit underrepresented students in STEM and careers in healthcare. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The electronic health record (EHR) has been thought to be a top! to decrease patient deaths related to miscommunication. However, the current EHR falls short of this goal. We propose to develop and test an algorithm that will augment the EHR to more effectively assist nurses in decision-making and communication, ultimately increasing patient safety.                 n/a",SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs) ,8894220,R01EB020395,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'STEM career', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'computer science', 'falls', 'forging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'light weight', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'social', 'usability', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2014,251572,0.08092370560013182
"Automated Dynamic Lists for Efficient Electronic Health Record Management DESCRIPTION (provided by APPLICANT): Medical errors are recognized as the cause of numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many are preventable. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information in the electronic health record (EHR). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the information available in the EHR is only mentioned in narrative clinical documents. Electronic lists of problems and allergies are available in most EHRs, but they require manual management by their users, to add new problems, modify existing ones, and the removal of the ones that are irrelevant. Consequently, these electronic lists are often incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to develop a new system to automatically extract structured and coded medical problems and allergies from clinical narrative text in the EHR of patients suffering from cancer. To establish the merit and feasibility of such a system, we will work on the following objectives: 1) create a reference standard for training and testing the information extraction application, a reference standard including a random sample of de-identified clinical narratives from patients treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute Cancer Clinics (Salt Lake City, Utah), with problems and allergies annotated by domain experts; 2) develop a prototype to automatically extract medical problems and allergies, implementing a novel stepwise hybrid approach to maximize sensitivity first, and also enhance positive predictive value; and 3) test the prototype with the aforementioned reference standard, using a cross-validation approach for training and testing. Commercial application: The system Clinacuity proposes will not only help healthcare providers maintain complete and timely lists of problems and allergies, providing them with an efficient overview of a patient, but also help healthcare organizations attain meaningful use requirements. The proposed system has potential commercial applications in inpatient and outpatient settings, increasing the efficiency of busy healthcare providers by saving time, and aiding healthcare organizations in demonstrating ""meaningful use"" and obtaining Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services incentive payments. Clinacuity will further extend the commercial potential of the system and it is output, using modular design principles allowing utilization of each module independently, and enhancing its local adaptability for easier deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medical errors cause numerous deaths, and even if some are difficult to avoid, many could be prevented. Computerized physician order-entry systems with decision support have been proposed to reduce this risk of medication errors, but these systems rely on structured and coded information such as entries in electronic lists of problems and allergies.

"Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) prevalence has increased and will continue so over the next 30 years with a profound individual and societal burden. Early detection of HF may be useful in mitigating this burden. The purpose of this proposal is to develop robust predictive models that make use of longitudinal electronic health record (EHR). Our long term goal is to use such models to detect HF at an earlier stage (e.g., AHA/ACA Stages A or B) than usually occurs in primary care. We have completed extensive preliminary work using 10 years of longitudinal EHR data on primary care patients. Using text mining and machine learning tools we have found that Framingham criteria are documented in the EHR long before more specific diagnostic studies are done. These symptoms are considerably more common among incident HF cases than controls two to four years before diagnosis. Moreover, clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and other data routinely captured in the EHR predicts future HF diagnosis. We propose to extend this work on early detection of HF with the following aims: 1) To develop more sensitive and specific criteria for use of Framingham HF signs and symptoms in the early detection of HF. We have shown that positive and negative affirmation of Framingham signs and symptoms are useful in HF detection 1-4 years before diagnosis. We propose to address the following: a) Which Framingham signs and symptoms and combinations thereof are most useful for early detection? b) Are there temporal sequences and correlations among signs and symptoms that improve accuracy of detection? c) How do the criteria vary by HF subtype? We hypothesize that analysis of routinely documented signs and symptoms data will yield a clinically meaningful improvement in the accuracy of detecting HF 1 to 2 years before actual diagnosis; 2) To determine the differential improvement in accuracy of predicting diagnosis of HF by combining common fixed field EHR data with text data to improve early detection of HF. Our preliminary work indicates that longitudinal EHR data (e.g., clinical, laboratory, health behaviors, diagnoses, use of care, etc) are useful in predicting future HF diagnosis. Based on these findings, we recognize an increasingly sophisticated analysis will be required to identify how to use these data to optimize predictive power. We hypothesize that the specific models and the performance of these models will vary by HF subtypes of HF; 3) To determine how digital ECG related measures can be used alone and in combination with other data to improve early detection of HF. Real time access to digital ECG data affords unique opportunities to extract a diversity of measures that may be useful in primary care in the early detection of HF; and 4) To develop preliminary operational protocols for early detection of HF in primary care. We will need to consider how the output from the model can be used to support clinical guidance and shared decision-making. Moreover, models need to be developed for data rich and data poor settings. The long term goal of the proposed work is relevant to the national priority for adoption of EHRs in clinical practice and for meaningful use of such technology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart Failure (HF) strikes one in 5 US citizens over age 40, has a profound impact on health, and is almost always detected too late to allow doctors to substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. We propose to use sophisticated analytic tools to search through electronic health records of patients for early signals of HF. The long term goal of our work is to use such tools to detect HF early enough to allow doctors to change the course of disease and substantially reduce HF morbidity and the risk of death.                ",Early Detection of Heart Failure via the Electronic Health Record in Primary Care,8421618,R01HL116832,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employee Strikes', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'body system', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'shared decision making', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NHLBI,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R01,2013,557031,0.03570343420714451
"An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to leverage an information fusion approach to integrate structured and unstructured information to generate a longitudinal health record (LHR) for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Because electronic health records (EHR) contain clinical summaries of a patient's clinical history, one would assume that they could be easily leveraged to automatically screen and identify potentially eligible patients. However most EHRs are not well designed to support screening of eligible patients and are composed of multiple data sources that are often redundant or inconsistent, stored in uncoordinated unstructured clinical narratives and structured data. These characteristics make EHRs difficult to use for matching patients against the complex event and temporal criteria of clinical trials protocols. This research proposes that an improved LHR, which contains a comprehensive clinical summary of a patient, can improve patient screening. We propose using a method of information fusion to generate this LHR, which merges information from multiple data sources, that addresses both the meaning and temporal nature of data, such that the resulting information is more accurate than would be possible if these sources were used individually.         The specific aims are to: 1) characterize the barriers of using EHR sources for screening in terms of data redundancy, inconsistency, lack of structure, and temporal imprecision; 2) automatically extract information from unstructured EHR sources necessary for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility criteria using natural language processing; 3) developan LHR appropriate for screening patients against eligibility criteria using information fusion methods based on semantic and temporal information; and 4) evaluate the accuracy of an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients against clinical trials eligibility critera.         The respective hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Different parts of the EHR will contain variable amounts of redundancy, inconsistency, and temporal imprecision. Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.

"EHR-based patient safety: Automated error detection in neonatal intensive care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the field of neonatal patient safety, the paucity of systematic research is a critical barrier to progress. Notably missing are studies that meticulously investigate Electronic Health Records (EHR) and information technology in detecting neonatal intensive care-related errors. The expert panel at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD) identified multiple gaps in the current knowledge of neonatal patient safety research. The proposed work is a well focused response to three dimensions of the Funding Opportunity Announcement:  1.Develop prospective and retrospective study designs to collect data on patient safety and adverse events.  2.Study the strength and limitations of current methods of error reporting systems.  3.Study the usefulness of commercial IT systems and EHRs in reducing medical errors.  In our study we seek to shift patient safety research toward an automated and computerized approach to achieve a more comprehensive patient safety paradigm. We will develop novel Electronic Health Record (EHR) content-based automated algorithms that are new to patient safety research to 1) detect errors (Aim 1) and 2) categorize subsequent harm (Aim 2). State of the art information extraction and statistical classification techniques from the field of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) will be adapted to the patient safety research tasks.  In Aim 1 we will fill the gap in the literatre by implementing a focused manual review of 700 charts (one full year of patient admissions at our institution) in one of the largest Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) in the nation. Using a trigger tool, we will identify errors occurring in three specified categories - laboratory test errrs, medication/fluid errors, and airway management errors. We will develop novel algorithms for automated EHR-based detection of the errors and evaluate the performance of the new algorithms against the performance of both trigger tool review by human chart reviewers (current gold standard) and the voluntary incident reporting system (accepted standard). In Aim 2, we will study the utility of novel EHR-based information extraction and statistical algorithms for the automated categorization of errors according to the resulting level of harm.  Our proposed work has the potential to accomplish a paradigm shift in the methods of neonatal patient safety research and practice. The study is a fundamental step to automating patient safety monitoring on a large scale and improving error identification and patient safety in NICUs for millions of children every year.          We are developing an automated error detection technique to improve the safety of newborn babies during hospital care. Our work is the first known attempt to use text analysis in the electronic health records on a large scale to reduce the cost while at the same time increase the speed and comprehensiveness of error detection in the clinical care of newborns.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases. We are confident the methods will be effective because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in this proposal presents an excellent chance to dramatically improve patient safety and reduce costs.               This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by developing effective methods for the discovery of new adverse drug events. The use of natural language processing on vast quantities of EHR records will result in the harnessing of comprehensive clinical information for this purpose, overcoming some of the limitations of current methods that rely on spontaneous reporting and administrative databases.","Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR",8318253,R01LM010016,"['Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Back', 'Cereals', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Office Visits', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'administrative database', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'drug testing', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'post-market', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2012,327503,0.02048723444800724
"Contextual ASR to Support EHR Adoption    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems is a national healthcare priority. However studies show massive physician productivity drop of up to 25-40% upon transition to EHR. The majority of workflow delay is based on the need to perform manual operations to fill structured forms within the EHR, as opposed to simple unstructured narratives used in traditional written notes and transcriptions. Vanguard Medical Technologies (VMT), under NIH grant 1R43LM010750, proved feasibility for DocTalk, a real-time, speech-driven, open-source augmented, small practice encounter recording system that processes voice to text to structured medical data to EHR input, utilizing integrated automated speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) in the cloud. While NLP accuracy in Phase I was high, voice accuracy prior to physician review was inadequate. Fortunately, the tight integration of ASR and NLP combined with the formal structure of physician notes offers unique context based approaches to address the challenge. Current speech recognition methods use a single general-purpose medical lexicon to train a recognizer when identifying words. Medical context-specific probabilities are ignored. The four Specific Aims of this Phase I SBIR project are to: 1. Create a textual corpus for each section of a patient encounter note by processing 1 million text based narrative structured encounter notes 2. Build a family of Section-Specific Statistical Language Models (SS-SLMs) specialized in recognizing speech pertaining to each specific section of a patient encounter note, using industry standard open source statistical language modeling tools. 3. Use NLP techniques to infer patterns of language usage from text of each section, a. To detect section boundaries to be used as trigger words for invoking SS-SLMs b. To determine characteristic word distributions of each section 4. Assess improvement in accuracy per section due to use of SS-SLMs, with the goal of 50% overall reduction of errors compared to non-section-specific SLMs in the same medical dictation system.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of this innovative proposed program of NLP-enhanced context based ASR, will provide the accuracy required to deploy an integrated, interactive, intuitive, low-cost data entry system for small practice primary care physicians. The augmented DocTalk system will enable physicians to increase usable information, avoid third-party transcription errors, and mitigate workflow delays.

Some sources will be more valuable for matching patients than others to clinical trials eligibility criteria. 2) Including th information contained in the unstructured notes will reduce the false positive rate of identifying potentially eligible patients over leveraging only the structured data in the EHR. 3) By using information fusion methods based on leveraging semantic and temporal information on a combination of structured and unstructured data, we will be able to accurately summarize the information contained in uncoordinated EHR data sources into an LHR that can be used for screening patients for clinical trials. 4) The use of information fusion to generate a longitudinal health record will increase the sensitivity and specificity of electronic clinical trial screening ver using a traditional EHR.         With an LHR formed through information fusion for screening patients for clinical trials eligibilit, we will be able to not only reduce the amount of staff effort required to recruit a patient into a clinical trial, but also accelerate the pace at which clinical trials can be conducted.                  Narrative This project is focused on generating a longitudinal health record for accelerating the pace at which patients can be recruited into clinical trials. Accelerating the pace at which patients are recruited into clinical trials has the potential for improving the speed at which new treatments are made available to the public.",An Information Fusion Approach to Longitudinal Health Records,8373437,R01LM011116,"['Address', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'falls', 'health record', 'improved']",NLM,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,341342,0.07609365157018803
"Applying NLP to Free Text as an EHR Data Capture Method to Improve EHR Usability     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to ensure the ability of ""NLP-Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation,"" a method of EHR data capture involving Natural Language Processing and possibly also standard EHR data capture, to improve the usability of EHR by reducing documentation time, increasing documentation quality, and increasing clinician satisfaction. Problem to be Addressed. Limited usability of the Electronic Health Record (""EHR"") and lack of standardized terminology impedes EHR adoption and optimal use, and therefore hinders realization of a universally interoperable and evidence-based reportable health care system. Large amounts of time required for documentation, low clinician satisfaction, and incomplete documentation are problems plaguing EHR. Innovation. Current research has demonstrated that NLP may be used for EHR data capture. ZyDoc is furthering the state of research by assessing the capability of NLP-Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation to improve EHR usability along several criteria. Long Term Goal. By enabling interoperability and improving EHR usability, through improving clinician satisfaction, improving documentation quality, and reducing data capture time, MediSapien will encourage widespread EHR adoption and optimal use with structured data. Phase I Summary. The purpose of the first Specific Aim of this grant proposal is to ensure that NLP- Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation is capable of improving clinician satisfaction, efficiency, and documentation quality, relative to standard EHR data capture methods. The purpose of the second Specific Aim is to improve the accuracy of MediSapien's coding. These Specific Aims will ensure the technical feasibility of NLP-Standalone-or-Hybrid Documentation and MediSapien for improving EHR usability. Phase II Objectives.

"EHR-based patient safety: Automated error detection in neonatal intensive care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the field of neonatal patient safety, the paucity of systematic research is a critical barrier to progress. Notably missing are studies that meticulously investigate Electronic Health Records (EHR) and information technology in detecting neonatal intensive care-related errors. The expert panel at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD) identified multiple gaps in the current knowledge of neonatal patient safety research. The proposed work is a well focused response to three dimensions of the Funding Opportunity Announcement:  1.Develop prospective and retrospective study designs to collect data on patient safety and adverse events.  2.Study the strength and limitations of current methods of error reporting systems.  3.Study the usefulness of commercial IT systems and EHRs in reducing medical errors.  In our study we seek to shift patient safety research toward an automated and computerized approach to achieve a more comprehensive patient safety paradigm. We will develop novel Electronic Health Record (EHR) content-based automated algorithms that are new to patient safety research to 1) detect errors (Aim 1) and 2) categorize subsequent harm (Aim 2). State of the art information extraction and statistical classification techniques from the field of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) will be adapted to the patient safety research tasks.  In Aim 1 we will fill the gap in the literatre by implementing a focused manual review of 700 charts (one full year of patient admissions at our institution) in one of the largest Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) in the nation. Using a trigger tool, we will identify errors occurring in three specified categories - laboratory test errrs, medication/fluid errors, and airway management errors. We will develop novel algorithms for automated EHR-based detection of the errors and evaluate the performance of the new algorithms against the performance of both trigger tool review by human chart reviewers (current gold standard) and the voluntary incident reporting system (accepted standard). In Aim 2, we will study the utility of novel EHR-based information extraction and statistical algorithms for the automated categorization of errors according to the resulting level of harm.  Our proposed work has the potential to accomplish a paradigm shift in the methods of neonatal patient safety research and practice. The study is a fundamental step to automating patient safety monitoring on a large scale and improving error identification and patient safety in NICUs for millions of children every year.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are developing an automated error detection technique to improve the safety of newborn babies during hospital care. Our work is the first known attempt to use text analysis in the electronic health records on a large scale to reduce the cost while at the same time increase the speed and comprehensiveness of error detection in the clinical care of newborns.              We are developing an automated error detection technique to improve the safety of newborn babies during hospital care.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases. We are confident the methods will be effective because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in this proposal presents an excellent chance to dramatically improve patient safety and reduce costs.               This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by developing effective methods for the discovery of new adverse drug events.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive.

Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants.

"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data. Under the supervision of our consultants Dr. Frank Sacks, Dr. Vincent Carey, and two Registered Nurses, we will create a gold-standard annotation of events and temporal information within patient narratives from de- identified Electronic Health Record data using the CLEF and TimeML guidelines.

"Voice Based, Workflow Enhancing, Primary Care Medical Data Input System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) in hospitals and physician offices has been widely promoted as a single solution to a wide variety of health care issues. Yet 84% of small and medium business (SMB) physician practices in the US have not adopted EHR systems. Interventional Dynamics Corporation (IDC) has conducted more than 200 primary care physician interviews, finding that the major disincentives to adoption are workflow delay and expense. The single greatest factor in the reduction of workflow speed is the data input process. IDC's proposed project has this specific aim: Utilize an innovative voice entry technique and open source code systems to develop a low-cost, automated solution to allow primary care physicians to complete a primary care note entirely during the patient examination process. The narrative speech input will be analyzed in a context-sensitive, domain-restricted manner to produce structured clinical data that can be readily integrated into standards-compliant electronic medical records. By using speech inputs that are converted directly to relevant EHR entries, physicians can increase the accuracy of their notes, eliminate third party transcription errors and avoid workflow delays. The project approach will include:    Further testing and final development of DocTalk, the IDC patent pending speech system that allows accurate natural language processing of structured medical information; Development of a proof-of-concept data system that converts physician voice input from voice to text to structured text to EHR data using domain enhanced open source code; The evaluation of the effectiveness of the proof-of-concept system against traditional EHR  input methods with the following goals: Achieve 50% or more reduction in charting time,  achieve 90% or more accuracy in output, and score greater than 4 of 5 on subjective  metrics including learnability, workflow fit, usability, and overall satisfaction. Successful completion of the proposed program will provide IDC with a viable technology platform that can immediately be useful to primary care physicians in generating structured documents for use with their current EHR platforms. Furthermore, the technology developed and refined within this program can be expanded in multiple ways.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The IDC technology is designed to circumvent the normal barriers to adoption in the SMB market and allow for quick increases in workflow and quality of patient care at a minimal price point. IDC will provide physicians who currently use pen and paper a more natural and faster way to input clinical data, eliminating time spent on hunt-and-peck keyboard entry or complicated EHR screen navigation. The system will generate structured clinical data that enables the exchange of health information, the portability of patient records, billing, data analytics (both local practice and public health), marketing, and other benefits, resulting in the reduction of overall healthcare costs.           Narrative The IDC technology is designed to circumvent the normal barriers to adoption in the SMB market and allow for quick increases in workflow and quality of patient care at a minimal price point.

"Pharmacovigilence using Natural Language Processing, Statistics, and the EHR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance patient safety and reduce the cost of medical care by discovering novel adverse drug events (ADEs) through use of automated methods. We will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and data mining methodologies on vast quantities of clinical data in electronic health records (EHRs) to detect novel ADE signals. ADEs are major problems world-wide and cause hospitalizations, deaths, and incur a huge cost to health care. Therefore, continued post-marketing surveillance encompassing large and varied patient populations is crucial for patient safety. EHRs contain a comprehensive amount of clinical information, which if harnessed properly, would be invaluable for pharmacovigilance. We have already demonstrated that we can accurately encode information in clinical reports using the NLP system MedLEE, and that we can accurately detect associations among clinical events using statistical methods that we developed. Therefore, this is an excellent opportunity to continue our research accomplishments and to advance the state of the art in pharmacovigilance.       More specifically, MedLEE will be used to map comprehensive clinical information in the EHR to codified data, and then statistical methods will be used to generate an extensive knowledge base of disease-symptom, disease-drug, drug-drug, and drug-symptom associations, which will be used to discover new ADEs. Additionally, we will develop methods to determine the correct sequence of drug, disease, and symptom events, which is critical for detecting ADEs. We will also develop methods to map fine-grained concepts into higher level concepts, which is important for optimizing the statistical methods. The performance of our discovery methods will be evaluated by testing the methods using drugs currently in use with known ADEs, and also by using historical rollback. We will first focus on discovery of short-term events using inpatient records, and then longer-term events using outpatient office visits.       This proposal is well positioned to overcome problems associated with existing automated methods based on spontaneous reporting databases and administrative databases. We are confident the methods will be effective because a strong infrastructure is in place for us to build upon. Most importantly, the methodology developed in this proposal presents an excellent chance to dramatically improve patient safety and reduce costs.               This proposal aims to improve patient safety and reduce health care costs by developing effective methods for the discovery of new adverse drug events.

"Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Our long-term objective is to enlarge the scope and efficiency of clinical research through enhanced use of clinical data to support clinical research decisions. This proposal aims to improve the use of electronic health records (EHR) to automate clinical trials eligibility screening by developing a new semantic alignment framework. Clinical trials research is an important step for translating breakthroughs in basic biomedical sciences into knowledge that will benefit clinical practice and human health. However, a significant obstacle is identifying eligible participants. Eighty-six percent of all clinical trials are delayed in patient recruitment for from one to six months and 13% are delayed by more than six months. Enrollment delay is expensive. In a recent large, multi-center trial, about 86.8 staff hours and more than $1000 was spent to enroll each participant. Ineffective enrollment also produces a big social cost in that up to 60% of patients can miss being identified. The broad deployment of EHR systems has created unprecedented opportunities to solve the problem because EHR systems contain a rich source of information about potential participants. However, it is often a knowledge-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient manual procedure to match eligibility criteria such as ""renal in- sufficiency"" to clinical data such as ""serum creatinine = 1.0 mg/dl for an 80-year old white female patient."" This enduring challenge is partly caused by the disconnection between abstract and ambiguous eligibility criteria and highly specific clinical data manifestations; we call this a semantic gap. Despite earlier work on computer-based clinical guidelines and protocols, limited effort has been devoted to support automatic matching between concepts and their manifestations in patient phenotypes such as signs and symptoms.       We hypothesize that we can characterize the semantic gap and design a knowledge-based, natural-language processing assisted semantic alignment framework to bridge the semantic gap. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) to investigate the semantic gap between clinical trials eligibility criteria and clinical data; (2) to design a concept-based, computable knowledge representation for eligibility criteria; (3) to design a semantic alignment framework linking an eligibility criteria knowledge base and a clinical data warehouse to generate semantic queries for eligibility identification; and (4) to evaluate the utility of the semantic alignment framework.       This research is novel and unique in that (1) there are no prior studies about the semantic gap between eligibility criteria and clinical data; and (2) for the first time, we design a semantic alignment framework to automatically match eligibility criteria to clinical data. The research team comprising expertise from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and the Division of General Medicine from UCSF are uniquely positioned to carry out this research, given the experience of the team (medical knowledge representation, natural language processing, controlled clinical terminology, ontology-based semantic reasoning, data mining, statistics, health data organization, semantic harmonization, and clinical trials), the availability of a repository of 13 years of data on 2 million patients, and the availability of a natural language processor called MedLEE to convert millions of narrative reports into richly coded clinical data.            This research has the potential to improve process efficiency and accuracy, as well as to reduce cost and required human skills for clinical trials eligibility screening. The ultimate goal is to accelerate scientific discovery of more effective treatments for illness.",Bridging the Semantic Gap Between Research Eligibility Criteria and Clinical Data,7653874,R01LM009886,"['Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Formulations', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'eligible participant', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'novel', 'repository', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,357875,0.037059501749854534
"Temporal Processing for Medical Discharge Summaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The goals of our project are as follows:     1. Create a corpus of temporally annotated data.

"POET: Consolidated, Comprehensive Clinical Text Preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       As electronic health records (EHRs) continue their expansion into clinical settings, there has been a corresponding increase in interest in mining the data they contain, both for research as well as for clinical decision support. Informaticists are increasingly studying ways to mine EHR textual content. This is an important trend, because there is a wealth of information contained in clinical text not represented anywhere else in the EHR. There is a low level text-as-data issue which presents a significant obstacle to the widespread use of available medical NLP systems: hand-typed clinical narratives in EHRs are usually ungrammatical; short or telegraphic in style; full of abbreviations, acronyms, and misspellings; formatted in a templated or pseudo-tabular form; and contain embedded non-text such as a list of laboratory values cut-and-pasted from elsewhere in the EHR. As we show in the Preliminary Studies Section, this makes high-level processing by popular tools like MedLEE and MetaMap effectively useless for all but a few ""clean"" document types like discharge summaries or consult reports (e.g., pathology or radiology reports). This in turn explains why there is so little published about what is certainly the preponderance of clinical texts, those that are not as well-behaved lexically and syntactically as a discharge summary.       In this application we distinguish clinical narratives (e.g., a progress note) from biomedical narratives (e.g., a PubMed abstract). We are interested in texts that arise in the clinical or research setting; texts that are composed by clinicians and researchers directly into a computer system. We propose to build and publish a tool called POET (Parsable Output Extracted from Text). POET will be designed to accept unstructured textual documents and return structured, linguistic equivalents that are, to the extent possible, parsable by higher-level NLP engines. POET will have an architecture is modular, extensible, and based on open-source platforms and sources (e.g., Java, Perl, UMLS, NegEx, the Stanford Parser, HL7 Clinical Document Architecture, caGRID, etc.). To implement POET, we will collect, program, and evaluate published as well as novel algorithms for: acronym/abbreviation resolution; spelling correction; template and pseudo-table re-writing; and removal of embedded non-text. To test POET we will use a large corpus of cross-discipline (e.g., medical, nursing, pharmacy, etc.) clinical note types, as well as the clinical research texts MedWatch reports and IRB adverse event reports. The development of POET will combine the best practices found in the literature and new research efforts as part of the project. To validate the fidelity of POET processing we plan a formal analysis of information loss and information gain pre- and post-process. To ensure broad access to the tools, POET will be released under an open-source license. Finally, we plan to assess the feasibility of offering POET as a Web service for remote processing.           Public Health Relevance This project attempts the construction of POET, a low-level preprocessing system for full text that can be used to open up large portions of the electronic health record (EHR) to high-level NLP systems. The potential public health implications are: 1) POET will allow the expansion of the use of well-proven clinical NLP systems  (currently limited to only a few document types found in the EHR) to the entire  clinical text record; with the entirety of the clinical record accessible to NLP,  serious and realistic attempts at real-time clinical text surveillance can be  mounted to improve patient safety and quality of care; 2) POET will be made available through open source distribution and other means  to encourage the practical deployment of innovative decision support systems  using large healthcare network EHRs across the country; 3) POET meets an important translational public health informatics need by solving  persistent low-level barriers to effective data mining of clinical marriages in the  EHR. The wider public health implications include promoting effective computerized decision support and data mining to improve both personal and public health outcomes.","POET: Consolidated, Comprehensive Clinical Text Preprocessing",7847940,R21LM009967,"['Abbreviations', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Body of uterus', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pharmacists', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Systems', 'Consult', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Hand', 'Healthcare', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Laboratories', 'Licensing', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Marriage', 'Medical', 'Mind', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paste substance', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physical assessment', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics Committees', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'acronyms', 'base', 'caGrid', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'discrete data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'spelling', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2009,84657,0.02736749556840936

"POET: Consolidated, Comprehensive Clinical Text Preprocessing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       As electronic health records (EHRs) continue their expansion into clinical settings, there has been a corresponding increase in interest in mining the data they contain, both for research as well as for clinical decision support. Informaticists are increasingly studying ways to mine EHR textual content. This is an important trend, because there is a wealth of information contained in clinical text not represented anywhere else in the EHR. There is a low level text-as-data issue which presents a significant obstacle to the widespread use of available medical NLP systems: hand-typed clinical narratives in EHRs are usually ungrammatical; short or telegraphic in style; full of abbreviations, acronyms, and misspellings; formatted in a templated or pseudo-tabular form; and contain embedded non-text such as a list of laboratory values cut-and-pasted from elsewhere in the EHR. As we show in the Preliminary Studies Section, this makes high-level processing by popular tools like MedLEE and MetaMap effectively useless for all but a few ""clean"" document types like discharge summaries or consult reports (e.g., pathology or radiology reports). This in turn explains why there is so little published about what is certainly the preponderance of clinical texts, those that are not as well-behaved lexically and syntactically as a discharge summary.       In this application we distinguish clinical narratives (e.g., a progress note) from biomedical narratives (e.g., a PubMed abstract). We are interested in texts that arise in the clinical or research setting; texts that are composed by clinicians and researchers directly into a computer system.

"Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease ABSTRACT The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Elsie Ross, Assistant Professor of Surgery (Vascular Surgery) and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics Research) at Stanford University, the support necessary to transition her from a junior investigator into an independent surgeon-scientist in translational biomedical informatics. Dr. Ross is a vascular surgeon with an advanced degree in health services research and postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics. Her long-term goal is to combine her interdisciplinary training to develop and implement machine learning tools that will enable the delivery of precise, high-value care to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Her career development activities focus on advancing her ability to translate informatics discoveries into viable clinical tools by 1) completing didactic courses to deepen and expand her knowledge of deep learning algorithms, clinical trials and implementation science, 2) designing and conducting her first independent human subjects clinical research study evaluating the performance of machine learning technology, 3) implementing and evaluating the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based screening tool to identify latent vascular disease, and 4) strengthening her previous training in cost-effectiveness analysis to enable her future aim of evaluating the associated costs and utility of pro-active, automated disease screening. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr. Nigam Shah, a biomedical informatics expert who combines machine learning, text-mining and medical ontologies to enable a learning health care system; Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey a world-expert in cardiovascular clinical trials; and Dr. Paul Heidenreich, an expert in implementation sciences with a focus on the use of EHR interventions to improve care quality for cardiovascular patients and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new technologies. The research proposal builds on the candidate's prior work with using machine learning and EHR data to evaluate and predict cardiovascular disease outcomes. The candidate now proposes to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms in identifying patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) using EHR data (Aim 1), evaluate whether learned classification models perform better than traditional risk factors for identification of undiagnosed PAD in a prospective patient cohort (Aim 2), and implement an EHR-based screening tool to identify patients with undiagnosed PAD and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment effects (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will result in a novel, EHR-based screening tool for identification of undiagnosed vascular disease that can decrease PAD-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through earlier and more aggressive medical management. This research will also form the basis for an R01 application before the end of the award to conduct a multi-site randomized-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of EHR- based proactive PAD screening. ! ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease is a prevalent yet under-diagnosed condition that can lead to limb loss, stroke, heart attacks and/or premature death. Work proposed in this grant aims to develop technology using electronic health records and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify patients with undiagnosed peripheral artery disease and recommend treatment.

"Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  The rate of substance use-related hospital visits in the US continues to increase, and now outpaces visits for heart disease and respiratory failure. The prevalence of substance misuse (nonmedical use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines, illicit drugs, and/or alcohol) in hospitalized patients is estimated to be 15%-25% and far exceeds the prevalence in the general population. With over 35 million hospitalized patients per year, tens of millions of patients are not screened for substance misuse during their stay. Despite the recommendation for self-report questionnaires (single-question universal screens, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT], Drug Abuse Screening Tool [DAST]), screening rates remains low in hospitals. Current screening methods are resource-intensive, so a comprehensive and automated approach to substance misuse screening that will augment current clinical workflow would therefore be of great utility.  In the advent of Meaningful Use in the electronic health record (EHR), efficiency for substance misuse detection may be improved by leveraging data collected during usual care. Documentation of substance use is common and occurs in 97% of provider admission notes, but their free text format renders them difficult to mine and analyze. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning are subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) that provide a solution to analyze text data in the EHR to identify substance misuse. Modern NLP has fused with machine learning, another sub-field of AI focused on learning from data. In particular, the most powerful NLP methods rely on supervised learning, a type of machine learning that takes advantage of current reference standards to make predictions about unseen cases  In our earlier version of an NLP and machine learning tool, our opioid and alcohol misuse classifiers successfully used data from clinical notes collected in the first 24 hours of hospital admission to reach a sensitivity and specificity above 75% for detecting alcohol or opioid misuse. We will improve the performance of our baseline, individual NLP single-substance classifiers for alcohol and opioid misuse by implementing multi-label and multi-task machine learning methods. These methods will take advantage of information shared across different types of substance misuse and better capture the state of a patient within a single model. The resulting classifier will be capable of jointly inferring all types of substance misuse (alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, and non-opioid illicit misuse) including polysubstance use, and cater to each individual patient’s substance use treatment needs.  We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 35,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. The top performing classifier will then be tested prospectively to: (1) externally validate its screening performance in a hospital without established screening; and (2) test its effectiveness against usual care at a hospital with questionnaire-based substance misuse screening. We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal screening in hospitalized patients and guiding interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of the substance misuse classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems. We will rigorously develop and test substance misuse classifier retrospectively and then examine its performance prospectively in both a naïve and mature screening program. This will serve as the first step towards a comprehensive universal screener that leverages available data in the EHR.",Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients,10026785,R01DA051464,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Felis catus', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Sector', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Interviewer', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Social Work', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Substance Abuse Detection', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'comparison intervention', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interoperability', 'machine learning method', 'multitask', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening program', 'substance misuse', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'trend', 'unstructured data']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,663889,-0.02941216364394152

"Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing, and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations: insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3, we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non- VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers as clinical-investigators. Physical frailty is common in adults with heart failure and increases the risk for poor health outcomes. Clinicians need tools to identify adults with physical frailty as part of routine care to support early intervention to treat frailty and reduce this risk. This application seeks to develop a novel measure of physical frailty using data collected as part of routine clinical care and recorded in the electronic health record.",Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure,9953749,K25HL152006,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'American', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Quality of Care', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'frailty', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'random forest', 'routine care', 'screening', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K25,2020,143822,0.03527147678469385
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9838270,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'multiple data types', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,794994,0.059319888009179686
"Characterizing and targeting subphenotypes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder via individually imputed tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are highly heritable, severe and complex brain disorders characterized by substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity. Despite this, case-control studies often ignore such heterogeneity through their focus on the average patient, which may be the core reason for a lack of robust biomarkers indicative of an individual’s treatment response and outcome. Although they are classified as independent diagnostic entities, SCZ and BD are highly genetically correlated, exhibit high relative risks among relatives of both BD & SCZ patients, and have partially overlapping symptomatology and treatment. In this project we will use tissue and cell-type specific imputed transcriptomes for individuals with SCZ or BD in our VA discovery cohort comprising the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and Cooperative Studies Program 572 (CSP #572, “The Genetics of Functional Disability in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Illness”), as an intermediate molecular phenotype, to identify, characterize and target subphenotypes of these disorders. Findings from the VA discovery cohort will be validated in the PsycheMERGE and BioMe cohorts.  First, we will impute tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes for all individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) or bipolar disorder (BD) in the VA discovery cohort. To achieve this, we will train tissue (brain and peripheral tissues) and cell-type (glutamatergic & GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia from DLPFC) specific EpiXcan transcriptomic imputation models at the gene and isoform level. Secondly, we will use the imputed transcriptomes as an intermediate molecular phenotype to identify genetically-regulated gene expression (GReX) based subpopulations and within them the key molecular drivers using deep neural networks (DNNs). Lastly, we will identify key non-genetic biomarkers and effective treatments for each validated subphenotype. Non-genetic biomarkers will be based on pre-mined features available from the electronic health records (EHR) and features extracted from the EHR via natural language processing (NLP). The subphenotypes will be validated in the civilian cohorts PsycheMERGE and BioMe.  This project will take place at the Icahn School of Medicine, one of the leading centers of data science, genomics and precision medicine. The mentoring committee comprises experts in the fields of computational and functional genomics, integrative analysis, machine learning (including DNNs and NLP), and EHR mining. Dr. Voloudakis will develop the skills necessary to launch an independent academic career in genetically based EHR-informed precision psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are genetically correlated, highly heritable, severe and complex brain disorders characterized by substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity with partially overlap- ping symptomatology and treatment. This project will use tissue and cell-type specific imputed transcriptomes for individuals with SCZ or BD to identify, characterize and target subphenotypes of those disorders. We will use the Million Veteran Program and Cooperative Studies Program 572 (“The Genetics of Functional Disability in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Illness”) as the discovery cohorts and will validate our findings in the PsycheMERGE and BioMe cohorts.",Characterizing and targeting subphenotypes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder via individually imputed tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes,10055546,K08MH122911,"['Astrocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population Genetics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Productivity', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Psychiatry', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severity of illness', 'Symptoms', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computational basis', 'cooperative study', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'molecular phenotype', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient subsets', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'psychopharmacologic', 'skills', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K08,2020,191944,0.014256649700345332
"Deep clinical trajectory modeling to optimize accrual to cancer clinical trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Electronic health records (EHRs) are now ubiquitous in routine cancer care delivery. The large volumes of data that EHRs contain could constitute an important resource for research and quality improvement, but to date, EHRs have not fully realized this potential. Important clinical endpoints, such as disease histology, stage, response, progression, and burden, are often recorded in the EHR only in unstructured free-text form. Even when structured data are available, they may be recorded only at one point in time, such as diagnosis, and may not be as relevant later in a patient's dynamic disease trajectory. These barriers prevent scalable analysis of EHR data for even relatively straightforward research tasks, such as identification of a cohort of patients potentially eligible for clinical trials. Identifying patients for trials is an important challenge in cancer research, since under 5% of adults with cancer have historically enrolled in therapeutic trials. Tools are in development to better match patients to trials, but no such tools are both publicly available and capable of incorporating time- specific patient phenotypes generated using unstructured EHR data. Recent rapid innovation in deep learning techniques could provide novel solutions to these challenges. In ongoing work, I have found that natural language processing based on a neural network architecture can reliably extract clinically relevant oncologic endpoints from free-text radiology reports. My goal is to develop an independent research program focused on leveraging such methods to put the EHR to use at scale for discovery and improving cancer care delivery. My specific aims are (1) to develop and validate a clinically relevant, dynamic, pre-trained cancer trajectory model by applying deep learning to integrated structured and unstructured EHR data; (2) to apply transfer learning to a pre-trained cancer trajectory model to match patients to clinical trials using EHR data and clinical trial protocols; and (3) to pilot the incorporation of cancer trajectory modeling into an institutional clinical trial matching tool. In the near term, this work will facilitate accrual to clinical trials at our institution. During the independent research portion of the proposal, it will constitute the basis for a general framework for conducting scalable cancer research using EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) are now ubiquitous in routine cancer care delivery, but their utility for research and quality improvement has been limited by a dearth of methods for integrating the unstructured data in which most key cancer outcomes are encoded within EHRs. I propose to apply recent innovations in deep learning to integrate structured and unstructured data to create a dynamic pre-trained model of cancer patients' treatment trajectories, and to apply this model to identify patients who are appropriate candidates for clinical trials at times when they are eligible. I will then evaluate the effect of trajectory modeling on clinical trial accrual as I prepare for an independent research career focused on clinical cancer data science.",Deep clinical trajectory modeling to optimize accrual to cancer clinical trials,9880481,K99CA245899,"['Academia', 'Adult', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histology', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer care', 'cancer clinical trial', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial enrollment', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'design', 'electronic data', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'multiple data types', 'neoplasm registry', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'palliative', 'patient population', 'precision medicine clinical trials', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'skills', 'structural genomics', 'structured data', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'unstructured data']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K99,2020,170176,0.009450953678646021
"Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks Project Summary In this project we develop new methods for extracting important information from electronic health records based on recurrent neural networks. These methods represent the hierarchical and sequential nature of human language, leverage large scale datasets to make learning sophisticated representations possible, and make use of novel sources of supervision that are available at this scale. The model architecture we propose is a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN). This architecture explicitly represents temporality at multiple different time scales, with stacked RNN layers representing words, sentences, paragraphs, and documents. At the word level, the model is trained to predict important pieces of clinical information, such as negation and temporality, using existing labeled data sets. Training for clinical information extraction at the lowest level ensures that the higher-level models have a foundation of medically relevant inputs. We are still left with the challenge of training higher-level networks, because these models require massive amounts of labeled training data to learn. We solve this problem by taking advantage of the temporal aspect of information in an EHR, and having each higher-level recurrent layer train getting supervision from the future. For example, the document RNN is trained to predict billing codes and NLP concept codes that were found in the subsequent document. This source of supervision is scalable, and our preliminary data shows that it is effective at learning how to generate generalizable patient representations. The patient representations that our model learns are shareable across multiple tasks, potentially streamlining EHR-based research by eliminating what was previously a manual step – designing text-based variables to represent patients. We demonstrate a new workflow for text-based EHR research, showing how the same representations can be used for two completely distinct phenotyping tasks. These phenotyping studies make use of high-quality datasets of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital. PH is relatively rare, so finding every patient with a phenotyping algorithm is important for clinical research. ASD has several sub-phenotypes, and finding large numbers of patients from each sub- phenotype can help to better understand the mechanisms of ASD. Along with demonstrating the applicability of our representations on these specific clinical research use cases, we incorporate our patient representations into the i2b2 clinical research software, making them available to all clinical investigators using this platform at Boston Children’s Hospital. Project Narrative This project develops methods for extracting universal patient representations from unstructured text in electronic health records. These methods leverage huge amounts of clinical data, recurrent neural network architectures, and novel training techniques to incorporate information at multiple time scales. These methods are evaluated using public datasets to promote reproducibility, and applied to clinical research tasks that extend the knowledge of patients with pulmonary hypertension and autism spectrum disorder at Boston Children’s Hospital.",Learning Universal Patient Representations from Clinical Text with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks,9868326,R01LM012973,"['Architecture', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Face', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Rare Diseases', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Uncertainty', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'machine translation', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,367184,0.01667116752139345
"Sarcopenia: computable phenotypes and clinical outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY  Sarcopenia is a generalized muscle condition that develops with aging and complicates many common chronic diseases, resulting in low muscle mass, weakness, and impaired physical function. Sarcopenia contributes to disability, increased hospitalizations, healthcare costs, and risk of death. Despite being under- recognized clinically, sarcopenia is a major public health concern, with the worldwide prevalence projected to increase by up to 72% in the next 30 years. However, limited knowledge of sarcopenia among clinicians, combined with time pressures in clinical encounters delay its detection, and limit opportunity for intervention or recruitment into clinical trials. To overcome this barrier to detecting sarcopenia, we propose to use advanced big data and machine learning methods to identify additional component variables predicting sarcopenia among the rich electronic health record (EHR) data and develop a validated and portable sarcopenia computable phenotype (which uses a computer algorithm to detect patient characteristics or outcomes from the EHR). This innovative proposal takes advantage of key resources at Indiana University and its affiliation with the Regenstrief Institute and the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), a statewide multi-health system clinical data warehouse including >100 healthcare entities and >18 million unique patients with both coded and text-based data, combined with the ability to perform comprehensive musculoskeletal measurements in the Musculoskeletal Function Imaging and Tissue (MSK-FIT) Core funded through a NIAMS Core Center for Clinical Research grant (P30AR072581). Our long-term goal is to accurately identify patients with, or at risk for, sarcopenia and its consequences in order to provide targeted interventions. We hypothesize that by using medical informatics and machine learning innovations, computable phenotypes can identify patients with sarcopenia from the EHR, predict deficits in measured muscle strength and physical function, and prospectively predict risk of hospitalization and death. In Aim 1, we will categorize >2000 adult participants in the MSK-FIT Core with accessible EHR data, as either sarcopenic or nonsarcopenic according to measurements of muscle strength, muscle mass and physical performance. We will then use 75% of the MSK- FIT Core cohort to train machine deep learning algorithms to detect combinations of variables from these subjects’ EHR predicting whether the patient is sarcopenic or not sarcopenic. The performance of the resulting computable phenotype will then be tested in the remaining 25% of the MSK-FIT Core participants. In Aim 2, we will test the performance of the sarcopenia computable phenotype to detect a clinically meaningful phenotype in the entire INPC adult population (>18 million), by evaluating the ability to predict the rate of hospitalizations and death among patients rated as sarcopenic versus matched controls. Such a computable phenotype will then enable large scale targeted recruitment, pragmatic clinical trials, clinical evaluation and intervention.

"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); In recent years, there has been increasing evidence supporting the role of DSs in ADRD in preventing cognitive impairment but there is limited evidence and the sample sizes have been small. Real- world data (RWD) especially the EHR contain detailed treatment and response information from patients and could be used to detect the usage and effect of DSs, DSIs, which is more translational to clinical outcomes (e.g., MCI to ADRD conversion). To the best of our knowledge, there is no investigation on DSs usage and safety among patients in MCI and ADRD using EHR data. Our current parent award is focusing on the development of a translational informatics framework to enable the discovery of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs) by linking scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. To response to NOT-AG-20-008, this administrative supplement application will complement our parent award in multiple aspects: (1) developing novel and advanced data analytic methods for mining RWD in EHR, (2) identifying DSs usage information among patients with ADRD, and (3) detecting safety and effect of DS among patients with ADRD from existing EHR data. In our preliminary work, we have investigated the methods to identify DSs terms on EHR and developed natural language processing (NLP) methods to identify use status of DSs. We will further our efforts to collect a EHR dataset with DSs usage and AE-DSs signals from AD patients and develop innovative informatics methods to extract such information. Our specific aims are: (1) identifying DSs usage among patients with MCI and ADRD from existing EHR data; and (2) detecting the DSs safety signals and exploring the effect of DSs use on the conversion from MCI to ADRD from existing EHR data. The successful completion of this project will stimulate our further investigation on the role of DS use in patients with ADRD in a larger scale involving EHR data from other healthcare institutions. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this administrative supplement application, we will evaluate the usage and safety of dietary supplements (DSs) usage in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), respectively using electronic health records (EHR) data. We will also explore the feasibility of using EHR to detect DS effect on the conversion from MCI to ADRD. This research will address a critical and unmet need to conduct large-scale clinical research in DSs and improve evidence bases for healthcare practice. The successful accomplishment of this supplement project will deliver a novel informatics methods and generate DSI signals among patients with ADRD.

"Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records Abstract. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects 30-40% of hospitalized older adults, with the added cost of care estimated to be up to $7 billion. Although originally conceptualized as a transient disorder, delirium is now recognized to have significant consequences, including increased risk of death, functional decline, and long-term cognitive impairment. As up to 75% cases are not recognized by providers, there is an urgent need for additional methods to identify delirium for clinical and research purposes, and to stratify patients based on delirium risk. In this proposal, we present a novel approach to the identification of delirium based on large-scale data mining (i.e., pattern recognition) algorithms using machine learning and natural language processing applied to electronic health record (EHR) data, which will automate chart-based determination of delirium status and risk prediction. We will combine these algorithms with data collected through our recently implemented Virtual Acute Care for Elders (ACE) quality improvement project, which institutes delirium screening once per shift by nursing staff for all individuals over age 65 admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. This unprece- dented volume of data will allow us to achieve the necessary sample sizes for effective training and validation of our data mining algorithms. Data mining algorithms that discover patterns of associations in data, rather than testing predetermined hypotheses, are well suited to application in large-scale algorithms for identification of delirium. Using our Virtual ACE and hospital EHR data, we will be able to evaluate more than 10,000 individual features (e.g., text words and phrases, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, concurrent medical conditions) as- sociated with delirium, which will be classified as risk factors for delirium, as signs, symptoms, and descriptors of delirium itself, and as complications and consequences of delirium, based on expert consensus. We will then use these features to develop rules for identification of delirium in the EHR, as well as risk prediction models that can be integrated into the EHR to provide individualized assessments of delirium risk. This study will lay the foundation for methods of automated delirium identification and risk prediction in healthcare settings that are unable to implement the screening by providers done in our Virtual ACE, as well as for large-scale epidemiological investigations of delirium using EHR data, expanding the current armamentarium for studying this common and debilitating disorder. Project Narrative. Delirium, or acute confusional state, affects up to 7 million hospitalized older adults annu- ally and is associated with long-term declines in cognition and function, but is not recognized by providers in up to 75% of cases. The growth of electronic health records offers a unique opportunity to improve recognition of delir- ium, as methods for identifying delirium based on chart review by clinicians have been developed but are time- and resource-intensive. In this secondary data analysis, we will examine methods for automating delirium recog- nition and risk prediction in electronic health records using machine learning and natural language processing computer algorithms, which in turn will lead to improved care for this serious but often overlooked disorder.",Automating Delirium Identification and Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records,9873880,R01AG060993,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alabama', 'Algorithms', 'Ally', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational algorithm', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Delirium', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Staff', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Provider', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'confusion assessment method', 'data mining', 'epidemiology study', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'health care settings', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'model development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phrases', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'ward']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,376860,0.05532598792420658
"Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data SUMMARY The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic health records (EHR) that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of patients throughout the country. The observational data emerging from these systems provide an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the effectiveness of existing and novel treatments, and to monitor potential safety issues that may arise when interventions are used in broad patient populations. However, observational clinical data have exposures that are driven by many factors and therefore aggressive adjustment is needed to remove as much confounding bias as possible in order to make attribution regarding select exposures. The field of machine learning provides a powerful collection of data-driven approaches for performing flexible, thorough confounding adjustment, but performing reliable statistical inference is particularly challenging when these techniques are used as part of the analytic strategy. We propose to advance reproducible research methods by developing and illustrating novel targeted learning tools that leverage the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect and characterize health effect signals using large-scale EHR data. Specifically, we will first develop techniques for making efficient, statistically valid and robust inference for treatment effects using state-of-the-art machine learning tools. We will also develop online learning techniques to make such inference in the context of streaming EHR data. Methodological advances will enable us to formulate a formal, rigorous and practical framework for conducting continuous, effective and reliable surveillance for safety endpoints. Finally, we will develop statistical approaches for incorporating prior information -- including demographic, epidemiologic or pharmacodynamic knowledge, for example -- to improve health effect estimation and inference when the health outcome of interest is rare and the statistical problem is thus difficult, as often occurs in safety surveillance. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to enable biomedical researchers and public health regulators to carefully monitor and protect the health of the public by allowing them to more effectively and more reliably detect critical health effect signals that may be contained in population-scale EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The modernization and standardization of clinical care information systems is creating large networks of linked electronic medical records that capture key treatments and select patient outcomes for millions of U.S. subjects. The population scale of contemporary health care data is opening new opportunities for quickly learning from observational data, and is now supporting on-going national surveillance that will monitor the risks and benefits of both existing and novel treatment paths. The objective of this proposal is to provide an inferential framework that leverages the flexibility of machine learning methods to detect health effect signals, including in the important setting of high-dimensional confounders and/or rare events, and to develop a real-time sequential updating methodology for safety signal detection.",Statistical Methods for Incorporating Machine Learning Tools in Inference and Large-Scale Surveillance using Electronic Medical Records Data,9979940,R01HL137808,"['Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Sentinel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical care', 'comparative treatment', 'data streams', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'national surveillance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'risk minimization', 'software development', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,485987,0.04780559876451506
"Multi-objective representation learning methods for interpetable predictions of patient outcomesusing electronic health records Project Summary/Abstract This project proposes new methods for representing data in electronic health records (EHR) to improve pre- dictive modeling and interpretation of patient outcomes. EHR data offer a promising opportunity for advancing the understanding of how clinical decisions and patient conditions interact over time to inﬂuence patient health. However, EHR data are difﬁcult to use for predictive modeling due to the various data types they contain (con- tinuous, categorical, text, etc.), their longitudinal nature, the high amount of non-random missingness for certain measurements, and other concerns. Furthermore, patient outcomes often have heterogenous causes and re- quire information to be synthesized from several clinical lab measures and patient visits. The core challenge at hand is overcoming the mismatch between data representations in the EHR and the assumptions underly- ing commonly used statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. To this end, this project proposes novel wrapper-based methods for learning informative features from EHR data. Both methods propose specialized operators to handle sequential data, time delays, and variable interactions, and have the capacity to discover underlying clinical rules/decisions that affect patient outcomes. Importantly, both methods also produce archives of possible models that represent the best trade-offs between complexity and accuracy, which assists in model interpretation. These method advances are made possible by encoding a rich set of data operations as nodes in a directed acyclic graph, and optimizing the graph structures using multi-objective optimization. The central hypothesis of this research is that multi-objective optimization can learn effective data representations from the EHR to produce accurate, explanatory models of patient outcomes. Preliminary work has shown that these methods can effectively learn low-order data representations that improve the predictive ability of several state- of-the-art ML methods. This technique demonstrates good scaling properties with high-dimensional biomedical data. Aim 1 (K99) is to develop a multi-objective feature engineering method that pairs with existing ML methods to iteratively improve their performance by constructing new features from the raw data and using feedback from the trained model to guide feature construction. In Aim 2 (K99), this method is applied to form predictive models of the risk of heart disease and heart failure using longitudinal EHR data. The resultant models will be inter- preted with the help of mentors in order to translate predictions into clinical recommendations. For Aim 3 (R00), a second method is proposed that uses a similar framework to optimize existing neural network approaches in order to simplify their structure as much as possible while maintaining accuracy. The goal of Aim 4 (R00) is to identify hospital patients who are at risk of readmission and propose point-of-care strategies to mitigate that risk.

"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,10118580,R00NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncology', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2020,248966,0.022556785092458124
"Bridging the Gap between Genomics and Clinical Outcomes in CHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The NHLBI has invested extensively in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), recognizing that translating genomic discoveries into optimized management and therapeutic strategies for congenital heart disease (CHD) can only be achieved in the context of multi-center, collaborative research. Currently, the PCGC is lacking two fundamental capabilities that hinder its ability to define the genomic basis for CHD outcomes: (1) a robust mechanism for extracting pertinent, machine-readable clinical data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) across multiple institutions; and (2) a robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform that is capable of teasing apart the complex interplay between maternal factors, phenotypes, genotypes, gene functions and clinical outcomes. Here, we propose innovative solutions to these challenges, by assembling teams of content experts to leverage existing infrastructure to extract relevant outcomes directly from the EHR of participating PCGC Centers and by designing best-practice AI tools for outcomes research. Our principal goal is provide the vision, infrastructure and expertise to collaboratively empower CHD outcomes research, foster knowledge exchange, and train the next generation of genomic scientists. We propose to leverage existing data infrastructure to obtain Electronic Health Records (EHR) and other clinical variables at scale by partnering with other research networks to create a PCGC Data Resource. Using this resource, we will create and deploy a platform of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based predictors for CHD outcomes research, with the goal of translating genomic discoveries into improved management and therapeutic strategies for CHD.

"eMERGE IV Northwest: A partnership to evaluate the use of genomic information in the health care of diverse participants Project Abstract eMERGE IV (E4) proposes to investigate the implementation of 15 “genomic risk assessment” (GRA) scores in a network-wide set of diverse participants. These GRAs will include polygenic risk score (PRS) information, as well as risk information, such as personal and family health history, environmental and social health determinants, and physical and lab measures. The GRA will aggregate these factors into a single score to identify those who would benefit from screening and other interventions. Substantial challenges must be addressed before genomic medicine is a part of standard medical care. We will collaborate to refine multi-ancestry GRAs and support the inclusion of non-genetic risk factors extracted from the electronic health record with innovative natural language processing approaches and apply them in a cohort enriched for Asian ancestry, and sexual and gender minorities. The specific aims of our proposal are designed to use an implementation science approach to advance the integration of genomic data into clinical practice, including evaluation of patient perspectives and economic outcomes, and broadening the impact of eMERGE through collaborations. The University of Washington Medicine dedication to preventative health in a learning health system and broad expertise across genomics, statistical, ethical, informatic, implementation, outcomes and economic disciplines will support this multi-site clinical trial. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Refine GRA scores and outcomes measures for five high impact conditions, considering stakeholder input, for implementation in the electronic health record. The conditions are: colorectal cancer, breast cancer, osteoporosis, coronary artery disease, and glaucoma. Aim 2: Integrate 15 GRA scores and electronic clinical decision support for management into clinical care and the EHR and capture clinical outcomes. Aim 3: Evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and economic utility of GRA result return.

"Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The long-term goal of our ongoing project, “Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases,” is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to understand and improve health. The EHR, because of its broad capture of human health, greatly amplifies our ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the strength of EHR data—its breadth and flexible nature—imposes additional challenges. We have found that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. We previously showed that health care process bias exists to the extent, for example, that simple use of the data can create signals implying the opposite of what we know to be true. One of the most important factors is sparse, irregular sampling; we found that sampling bias can be reduced by reparameterizing time and that prediction techniques that can accommodate EHR-specific data and resist their biases like data assimilation can be used on EHR data to produce good estimates of glucose and HA1c. The previous cycle of this project produced 75 publications. We propose to develop methods to accommodate health care process bias, using both knowledge engineering and experience with health care process bias as well as advanced statistical techniques that employ dynamical models and latent variables. We hypothesize that heuristics and models combined with knowledge can improve our ability to generate inferences and learn phenotypes despite health care process bias. Our aims are as follows: (1) Taking a knowledge engineering approach, study the effect of preprocessing and analytic choices on reducing health care process bias, and using machine learning techniques, learn more about health care process bias. (2) Taking a more empirical approach, use dynamic latent factor modeling and variation inference to accommodate health care process bias, learning how a patient's health state and health processes affect censoring, exploiting information from many variables at once. (3) Use data assimilation and mechanistic models to learn otherwise unmeasurable physiologic phenotypes despite irregular, sparse sampling typical of electronic health records. (4) Use the developed models and generated phenotypes to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project studies the biases that health care processes bring to electronic health record data, and it develops methods to overcome those biases to improve reuse of the data for purposes such as clinical research and quality improvement.",Discovering and Applying Knowledge in Clinical Databases,9873996,R01LM006910,"['Active Learning', 'Adopted', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Assimilations', 'Award', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Insulin', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Observational Study', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'clinical database', 'data reuse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,582678,0.04009937042886866
"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research,9873997,R01MH118233,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data resource', 'delay sex', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'psychiatric genomics', 'random forest', 'sex', 'support tools', 'support vector machine']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,791339,0.06924678576053499
"Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic cigarettes were developed in China in the early 2000s and first introduced to the US market in 2007. Once established in the US, the product experienced explosive growth, with the number of electronic cigarette users doubling every year between 2008 and 2012. In 2012, it was estimated that 75% of US adults had heard of electronic cigarettes, and 8% had tried them. While electronic cigarettes have been studied over the last sev- eral years, no scientific consensus has emerged regarding either the safety of electronic cigarettes, or their po- tential as a smoking cessation aid. With this proposal, we will investigate how electronic cigarette use is documented in the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record, focusing specifically on the relationship between electronic cigarette use and com- bustible tobacco use, with the goal of understanding both how electronic cigarette use is documented in the context of the United States’ only nationwide health system, and how electronic cigarette related information can be reliably extracted from narrative clinical text using fully automated Natural Language Processing meth- ods. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research focuses on the use of Natural Language Processing methods to automatically extract mentions of electronic cigarette use from the Veterans Association Electronic Health Record. The research will provide insight into important, currently unresolved questions regarding how clinicians record electronic cigarette use in the context of a nationwide health system, and whether patients report the use of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid or use the devices in conjunction with combustible tobacco.",Investigating the documentation of E-cigarette use in the VA EHR,9852435,R03DA047577,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Professional Organizations', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Smoking', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'authority', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic hookah', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'smoking cessation', 'structured data', 'success', 'systems research', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'vape pens']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R03,2020,76250,0.032157752602093054
"Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with approximately 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the US experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP) every year. Early intervention following FEP is critical for achieving improved outcomes, yet treatment of FEP is often delayed between 1 and 3 years in the US due to delays in detection and referral. The World Health Organization has advocated shortening the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) to three months or less. The goal of this study is to develop and validate a universal EHR-based screening tool for early detection of FEP across large clinical populations in diverse healthcare settings. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of the tool across a wide range of healthcare settings, we will rely only on coded medical information collected in the course of care and thus widely available in EHRs. The tool will be developed and validated with data from three diverse health systems that cover over 8 million patients spanning a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds: Partners Healthcare System, Boston Children's Hospital, and Boston Medical Center. The study will be conducted by a closely collaborating interdisciplinary team of clinical specialists, psychosis researchers, and risk modeling experts based at these health systems and Harvard Medical School, with extensive experience in treating psychosis patients, and developing strategies for detecting FEP and EHR-based risk screening tools for early detection of various clinical conditions. Our preliminary studies show that EHR-based risk models can be used to sensitively and specifically detect FEP cases, on average 2 years before the first psychosis diagnosis appears in their EHR. Our specific aims include: 1. Define a robust cross-site case definition for FEP that relies only on information commonly available in EHRs and validate it through expert chart review; 2. Train and validate a predictive model for early detection of FEP based on large samples of patient data from the three sites; 3. Develop and validate FEP early detection models for key subpopulations, including patients receiving care at mental health clinics, adolescent medicine outpatient programs, and substance abuse treatment programs; and 4. Engage clinical stakeholders in the process of developing a prototype clinician-facing EHR-based risk screening tool for FEP, and release it as an open source SMART App, enabling further validation and clinical integration across a wide range of healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would provide a novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tool for improving the trajectory of those affected with psychosis and reducing the burden and costs of untreated illness. Psychosis is a major public health challenge, with difficulties and delays in detecting its onset that can lead to worse clinical outcomes. The proposed research will develop a clinician-facing electronic-health-record-based automated screening tool for early detection of the first episode of psychosis, with implications for reducing the duration of untreated psychosis as recommended by the NIMH and World Health Organization. The tool will be validated across three large and diverse health systems and released as an open source application (SMART App), increasing its potential for rapid implementation in health systems and clinical care.",Development and validation of an electronic health record prediction tool for first-episode psychosis,9864102,R01MH116042,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Boston', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'outpatient programs', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'socioeconomics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment program']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,847935,0.05224230338580964
"Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish a genomic medicine learning system to accelerate genomic knowledge discovery and application in electronic health records (EHRs). We will integrate deep characteristic phenotypes extracted from EHRs and evolving knowledge of genotype-phenotype associations to optimize the accuracy of variant interpretation and the cost-effectiveness of clinical genome/exome sequencing, and to accelerate the discovery of causal genes by constructing a dynamic genotype-phenotype knowledge network. Prior knowledge on phenotype-gene relationships and phenotypic information about patients can facilitate the identification of disease-causing mutations from thousands of genetic variants in the context of clinical genomic sequencing; however, how best to abstract phenotype information from notes in the EHRs of patients who are diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, standardize the computable representation of phenotypes, and utilize it in genomic interpretation remains unclear. Additionally, how to systematically compare phenotypes across diseases to discover new knowledge in human genetics remains a largely untapped area with great promise. To address these challenges, we will develop and validate scalable and portable open-source natural language processing (NLP) methods for automated and accurate abstraction of characteristic phenotype concepts (e.g., “j-shaped sella turcica” and “short stature”) from EHR narratives. We will then develop a phenotype-driven scoring system called EHR-Phenolyzer to predict the likely candidate genetic variants associated with the phenotypes for patients with genomic sequencing and a high probability of a monogenic condition. On this basis, we will develop a probabilistic disease diagnosis and knowledge discovery system using rich and deep EHR phenotypes, and evaluate these methods for genomic diagnosis and discovery using large- scale clinical exome sequencing data. Ultimately, these methods will support efficient, effective, and scalable genomic diagnostics, and facilitate the implementation of genome-guided precision medicine in clinical practice. NARRATIVE We will develop novel informatics methods to abstract characteristic phenotypes from electronic health records (EHRs) for patients diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, enable the interoperability of computable characteristic phenotypes with existing phenotype-genotype association knowledge such as OMIM and ClinVar, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of genomic diagnostics.",Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine,9925808,R01LM012895,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'cost effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'disease-causing mutation', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'health record', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient health information', 'phenotypic data', 'pituitary fossa', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,399965,0.03837023532832043
"From enrichment to insights Project Summary Most medical decisions are made without the support of rigorous evidence in large part due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized trials for most clinical situations. In practice, clinicians must use their judgement, informed by their own and the collective experience of their colleagues. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) enables the modern practitioner to algorithmically check the records of thousands or millions of patients to rapidly find similar cases and compare outcomes. In addition to filling the inferential gap in actionable evidence, these kinds of analyses avoid issues of ethics, practicality, and generalizability that plague randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Unfortunately, identifying patients with the appropriate phenotypes, properly leveraging available data to adjust results, and matching similar patients to reduce confounding remain critical challenges in every study that uses EHR data. Overcoming these challenges to improve the accuracy of observational studies conducted with EHR data is of paramount importance. Studies using EHR data begin by defining a set of patients with specific phenotypes, analogous to amassing a cohort for a clinical trial. This process of electronic phenotyping, is typically done via a set of rules defined by experts. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to complement consensus definitions created by experts and we propose several advances to validate and improve this practice. We will explore and quantify the effects of feature engineering choices to transform the diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory tests and clinical notes in the EHR into a computable feature matrix. Finally, building on recent advances, we plan to characterize the performance of existing methods and develop EHR-specific strategies for patient matching. Our work is significant because we will take on three challenging problems--electronic phenotyping, feature engineering, and patient matching--that stand in the way of generating insights via EHR data. If we are successful, we will significantly advance our ability to generate insights from the large amounts of health data that are routinely generated as a byproduct of clinical processes.

"Biases introduced by filtering electronic health records for patients with ""complete data"" PROJECT SUMMARY Nationwide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to the increasing availability of large clinical datasets. With statistical modeling and machine learning, these datasets have been be used in a wide range of applications, including diagnosis, decision support, cost reduction, and personalized medicine. However, because the same patient could be treated at multiple health care institutions, data from only a single EHR might not contain the complete medical history for that patient, with critical events potentially missing. A common approach to addressing this problem is to apply data checks that filter the EHR for patients whose data appear to be more “complete”. Examples of filters include requiring at least one visit per year or ensuring that age, sex, and race are all recorded. However, in a previous study using EHR data from seven institutions, we showed that these filters can greatly reduce the sample size and introduce unexpected biases by selecting sicker patients who seek care more often and changing the demographics of the resulting cohorts. This project extends this prior research by implementing an expanded set of data completeness filters and testing their accuracy and potential biases using a combination of national claims data and EHR data from dozens of hospitals and healthcare centers across the country. This will enable us to understand how data completeness varies in different EHRs and quantify the tradeoffs of different approaches to correcting for gaps in patients' records. First, we will develop and measure the accuracy of data completeness filters using national claims data. This provides a “gold standard” of longitudinal data where patients' complete medical histories are known during the periods in which they were enrolled in the insurance plan. After partitioning the data by provider groups to model gaps in EHR data, we will test how well data completeness filters, individually and in combined machine learning models, select patients with fewer gaps. We will then test whether the filters introduce biases by selecting sicker patients (more diagnoses, more visits, etc.) or changing their demographic characteristics (age, sex, and zip code). Then, we will test the filters on EHR data, first at a single large medical center, and then across a national network of 57 institutions, representing different geographic regions, patient populations, number of years of data, and types of health care facilities. We will evaluate the filters by measuring whether they improve the performance of a machine learning model for predicting hospital admissions. Our ultimate goals are to (a) help researchers balance the need for complete data with the biases this might introduce to their models and (b) help them predict how well models trained on one EHR dataset might work on other EHRs with different data completeness profiles.

"Health Information Technology for Surveillance of Health Care-Associated Infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health care-associated infections (HAIs) affect one in every 20 hospitalized patients and account for $10 billion dollars in potentially preventable health care expenditures annually. Current efforts at detection of HAIs are limited to manual chart review which hinders the generalizability and scalability of HAI detection. My goal in seeking a Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to develop a health services research career as a principal investigator focusing on leveraging novel health information technology (HIT) tools to improve the measurement of surgical health care quality, safety, and effectiveness. To continue my progress towards this goal, the objective of this project is to address the challenges of HAI detection by developing a robust and portable automated HAI surveillance toolkit. This toolkit will combine structured electronic health record (EHR) data with rich information locked in clinical notes using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. Our overall hypothesis is that combining structured variables from the EHR supplemented with NLP will improve our ability to identify HAIs after surgical procedures. To test the central hypothesis and accomplish the objectives for this application, I will pursue the following three specific aims: 1) Determine the EHR data elements indicative of postoperative HAIs and evaluate the performance of a novel HAI surveillance algorithm; 2) Identify the presence of postoperative SSIs from clinical notes using an automated portable NLP-based algorithm; 3) Apply user-centered design to create a high fidelity prototype of a surgical quality dashboard incorporating our HAI case detection methodology. This contribution is a significant first step in a continuum of research that utilizes the large amounts of data in the EHR combined with novel HIT methods to improve the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness. This approach is significant because the tools developed in this proposal have potential to serve as a prototype for identification and monitoring hospitals adverse events and could be replicated on a national scale. The proposed research is innovative in its approach using a combination of structured and unstructured data in the EHR along with novel machine learning and NLP tools to create a generalizable surveillance toolkit for the detection of HAIs. This proposal is responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-011) specifically addressing the use of HIT to improve quality measurement. I have assembled a mentoring team who all internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. This project will provide the means to place me on a trajectory towards a health services research career focused on improving the measurement of surgical health-care quality, safety, and effectiveness using novel HIT tools. In summary, my previous training and experience, innovative research plan, high-quality training plan, first-rate mentorship team, and supportive research environment give me the highest likelihood of success to research independence with the proposed K08 award.

"4/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will substantially advance our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders.

"Clinical Text Automatic De-Identification to Support Large Scale Data Reuse and Sharing The adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is growing at a fast pace in the U.S., and this growth results in very large quantities of patient clinical data becoming available in electronic format with tremendous potential but an equally large concern for patient confidentiality breaches. Secondary use of clinical data is essential to fulfill the potential for high quality healthcare, improved healthcare management, and effective clinical research. NIH expects that larger research projects share their research data in a way that protects the confidentiality of research subjects. De-identification of patient data has been proposed as a solution to both facilitate secondary use of clinical data and protect patient data confidentiality. The majority of clinical data found in the EHR is represented as narrative text clinical notes, and de-identification of clinical text is a tedious and costly manual endeavor. Automated approaches based on Natural Language Processing have been implemented and evaluated, allowing for higher accuracy and much faster de- identification than manual approaches. Clinacuity, Inc. proposes to advance a text de-identification system from a prototype to an accurate, adaptable, and robust system, integrated into the research infrastructure at our implementation and testing site (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC), and ready for commercialization efforts. To accomplish this undertaking, we will focus on the following specific aims and related objectives, while continuing to prepare the commercialization of the integrated system, with detailed market analysis, commercial roadmap development, and modern media communication: 1) Enhance the text de-identification system performance, scalability, and quality to produce an enterprise-grade solution ready for deployment; 2) Enable use of structured data for enhanced text de-identification (when structured PII is available) and for complete patient records de-identification (i.e., records combining structured and unstructured data). This aim also includes implementing “one-way” pseudo-identifier cryptographic hashing to enable securely linking already de-identified patient records; 3) Integrate the text de-identification system with a research data capture and management system. This includes implementation of the de-identification system as a secure web service, with standards-based access and integration. This de-identification system has potential commercial applications in clinical research and in healthcare settings. It will improve access to richer, more detailed, and more accurate clinical data (in clinical text) for clinical researchers. It will ease research data sharing (as expected for larger NIH-funded research projects) and help healthcare organizations protect patient data confidentiality. Significant time-savings will also be offered, with a process at least 200-1000 times faster than manual de-identification.

"Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics ABSTRACT Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest growing surgical procedure in the nation. Despite the high procedure volume, the evidence base for TJA procedures and associated interventions are limited. This is mainly due to lack of high quality data sources and the logistical difficulties associated with manually extracting TJA information from the unstructured text of the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of EHR and the advances in health information technology offer the potential to transform unstructured EHR notes into structured, codified format that can then be analyzed and shared with local and national arthroplasty registries and other agencies. We therefore propose to leverage unique data resources and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to build an informatics infrastructure for automated EHR data extraction and analysis. We will (1) develop a high performance, externally validated and user centric NLP- enabled algorithm for extraction of complex TJA-specific data elements from the structured and unstructured text of the EHR, (2) validate the algorithm externally in multiple EHR platforms and hospital settings, and (3) conduct a demonstration project focused on prediction of prosthetic joint infections using data elements collected by the NLP-enabled algorithm. Our overarching goal is to develop valid, open source and portable NLP-enabled data collection and risk prediction tools and disseminate them widely to hospitals participating in regional and national TJA registries. This research is significant as it leverages strong data resources and expertise to tackle the pressing need for high quality data and accurate prediction models in TJA. Automated data collection and processing capabilities will lead to an upsurge in secondary use of EHR to advance scientific knowledge on TJA risk factors, healthcare quality and patient outcomes. Accurate prediction of high risk patients for prosthetic joint infections will guide prevention and treatment decisions resulting in significant health benefits to TJA patients. The research is innovative because TJA-specific bioinformatics technology will shift TJA research from current under-powered, single-center studies to large, multi-center registry-based observational studies and clinical trials. Our deliverables have the potential to exert a sustained downstream effect on future TJA research, practice and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Lack of high quality data is a critical barrier to progress in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) research. We will utilize health information technology to automate extraction of rich TJA information from the electronic health records, and develop a robust risk prediction score for prosthetic joint infections, a devastating and yet preventable complication of TJA. Widespread adoption of these tools will enhance data collection capabilities and enable affordable large scale studies for practice improvements through secondary use of real-world data. Accurate prediction of post- operative infection risk among TJA candidates will guide individualized preventive strategies for modifiable risk factors, thereby reducing the burden of prosthetic joint infections in TJA patients.",Enhance Arthroplasty Research through Electronic Health Records and Nlp-Enabled Informatics,9880374,R01AR073147,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guide prevention', 'Health Benefit', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'age group', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'joint infection', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'portability', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'willingness']",NIAMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,592632,0.09212114145029991
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear.

"1/4 Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health factors, such as employment and educational attainment, can increase the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, as well as (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will generate new data in improving our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Major depression, anxiety disorders and substance use disorder are highly prevalent in the general population and have a huge societal burden. Given the substantial heritability of these conditions and their polygenic architecture, there is increasing interest in using quantitative measures of genetic risk (polygenic risk scores) for risk stratification.

"Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology PROJECT SUMMARY Healthcare has changed rapidly in the last decade with the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) and the creation of national EHR-based data networks that aim to improve the quality of care. The American College of Rheumatology's RISE registry is a federally Qualified Clinical Data Registry that collects EHR data from the practices of almost 1000 rheumatologists nationally, analyzes these data centrally, and continuously feeds back performance on quality measures to practices via a web-based dashboard. In this K24 proposal, the applicant proposes to utilize novel methods in clinical informatics to increase the accuracy of quality measurement, while also developing and testing new EHR-based quality measures relevant to rheumatic diseases. The proposed research will leverage her strong research portfolio, including grants from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, her successful track record of achieving national endorsement for EHR-based quality measures, existing data from over 1.4 million patients in the RISE database, and the outstanding institutional environment at the University of California, San Francisco. It will also support her ongoing career development in clinical informatics methods relevant to EHR-based clinical research. For this five year K24 award proposal, she plans to increase the time spent mentoring junior investigators in the field or quality and outcomes measurement in rheumatology, with the goal of helping trainees successfully launch academic research careers in patient- oriented research. Aligned with a comprehensive mentoring plan, the proposal outlines two specific aims, including using natural language processing to increase the accuracy of EHR-based quality measurement in RISE, and developing and validating new, prototype electronic clinical quality measures to monitor and address high impact gaps in care for patients with rheumatic disease. The work will prioritize outcome measures and use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model and Health Quality Measures Format to develop, specify and test measures. Measures developed through this research and mentoring program will be candidates for nationwide dissemination across rheumatology practices to improve care for individuals with rheumatic disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This mid-career investigator award will support a program in patient-oriented research in rheumatic diseases at the University of California, San Francisco. The award will allow the applicant to expand her research on the development and validation of health care quality measures and support her mentoring of early investigators. The proposed research aims to create quality measures that can be deployed across rheumatology practices to improve the quality of care, while training new researchers to perform innovative patient-oriented research in the area of electronic health record-based quality and outcomes measurement.",Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology,9873905,K24AR074534,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Feeds', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Preventive care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'dashboard', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data standards', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning progression', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient registry', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research study', 'rheumatologist', 'structured data', 'success', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2020,189666,0.04908888958465944
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9994228,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data harmonization', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics tool', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'pharmacovigilance', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2020,618291,0.0710352050845338
"Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD Project Summary This NHLBI K01 application supports the career development of Dr. Nrupen A. Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD.

"National Infrastructure for Standardized and Portable EHR Phenotyping Algorithms PROJECT SUMMARY With the rapidly growing adoption of patient electronic health record systems (EHRs) due to Meaningful Use, and linkage of EHRs to research biorepositories, evaluating the suitability of EHR data for clinical and translational research is becoming ever more important, with ramifications for genomic and observational research, clinical trials, and comparative effectiveness studies. A key component for identifying patient cohorts in the EHR is to define inclusion and exclusion criteria that algorithmically select sets of patients based on stored clinical data. This process is commonly referred to, as “EHR-driven phenotyping” is time-consuming and tedious due to the lack of a widely accepted and standards-based formal information model for defining phenotyping algorithms. To address this overall challenge, the proposed project will design, build and promote an open-access community infrastructure for standards-based development and sharing of phenotyping algorithms, as well as provide tools and resources for investigators, researchers and their informatics support staff to implement and execute the algorithms on native EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of patient cohorts for clinical and genomic research is a costly and time-consuming process. This bottleneck adversely affects public health by delaying research findings, and in some cases by making research costs prohibitively high. To address this issue, leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) for identifying patient cohorts has become an increasingly attractive option.

"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9864083,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'patient registry', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'septic patients', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,611937,0.05957630037087841
"Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions Project Summary  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) are morbid immunologic reactions to drugs that confer a mortality of 10-50%. Over the last decade, significant promise for prediction and prevention has come from the discovery that many SCARs are associated with variation within HLA class I alleles. For HLA-B*15:02, this has led to routine pre-prescription screening for carbamazepine in many Southeast Asian countries and a significant reduction in cases of carbamazepine SJS/TEN. Despite this progress, there is little known about genetic and epidemiological risk factors for SCARs related to commonly used drugs such as antibiotics. There is also limited information about HLA risk for SCARs across the diverse populations present in the United States. Furthermore, imprecision of clinical phenotyping and lack of standardized coding has led to challenges in finding SCAR cases in the electronic health record (EHR). Our proposed study aims to address critical challenges and gaps in our knowledge of antibiotic SCARs.  In Aim 1, we will leverage advanced informatics and longitudinal EHR data for over 11 million patients from Partners HealthCare System since the 1980s to identify SCAR cases. We will create, optimize and standardize reproducible methods for finding SCAR cases and validating a cohort of SCAR patients. This iterative process will be used to refine and disseminate an electronic phenotype to be validated cross-institutionally.  In Aim 2, we will analyze SCAR prevalence and conduct a case-control study to identify drug-specific and patient-specific risk factors for antibiotic-associated SCARs. We will compare clinical sequelae, quality of life and adherence of SCAR patients compared to controls through validated survey instruments.  In Aim 3, we will identify candidate HLA and genetic associations from patients with validated antibiotic- associated SCARs. We will examine difference in genetic risk in minority and health disparity populations and predict that we will be powered to establish HLA associations for vancomycin DRESS (i.e., drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) and sulfonamide antimicrobial and beta-lactam SCAR. HLA alone, or in combination with clinical risk factors, can lead to improved SCAR prevention and early diagnosis. We will establish a data sharing platform, in the form of an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.  The roadmap we develop will translate into the development of electronic phenotypes for serious adverse drug reactions that facilitate genetic discovery. Knowledge gained will be crucial to the translation of genetic data into clinical decision making. This is in close alignment with NIH’s research mission to accelerate genetic discovery for iatrogenic and preventable drug-induced diseases that will translate into prevention, earlier diagnosis and an enhanced mechanistic understanding that may lead to targeted therapeutic approaches. Narrative  Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) result in substantial morbidity, long term disability, health care burden and a mortality of 10-50%. To advance the science of clinical and genetic risk factor identification for antibiotic SCAR, we will leverage large electronic health record (EHR) data and advanced informatics technology. Through case validation we will create an informatics roadmap for other institutions with similar EHR data to identify SCAR cases and we will establish a data sharing platform, including an online electronic phenotype and patient registry, that can be used to enlarge SCAR cohorts for future large-scale genomics studies.",Clinical Informatics to Advance Epidemiology and Pharmacogenetics of Serious Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions,10018800,R01AI150295,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Adverse reactions', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Allopurinol', 'Antibiotics', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biological Markers', 'Carbamazepine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Country', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Administration Routes', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eosinophilia', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Female', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mandatory Reporting', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monobactams', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nevirapine', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Sulfonamides', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vancomycin', 'Variant', 'abacavir', 'adverse drug reaction', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'care burden', 'case control', 'case finding', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'health disparity', 'immunoreaction', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'sex', 'sharing platform', 'southeast Asian', 'targeted treatment']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,696239,0.051615578831675765
"Clinical and Translational Science Award PROJECT SUMMARY: COMBATCOVID The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every corner of the globe and has redefined healthcare throughout the United States. COVID-19 cases in the New York City tri-state area have reached an extraordinarily high number and have quickly become the epicenter region of the crisis in the United States. In New York State alone, there are over 372,000 confirmed cases as of June 1, 2020. NYU Langone Health (NYULH) has been particularly hard hit, with more than 8,100 COVID-19 hospitalizations to date. In response, the entire clinical research community is marshalling resources in an attempt to improve our understanding of how the virus spreads, how it infects various tissues in the body, which patients are more susceptible to infection and fatal outcomes, which therapeutics improve symptoms and survival, whether the immune response confers long-lasting protection against reinfection, and many other crucially important questions. The complexity of the development of this disease and unpredictability of progression into severity, as well as the variety of phenotypic outcomes observed during and post COVID-19, pose major challenges in understanding, predicting, preventing, managing and treating this disease and its sequelae. Answers to these challenges can only be achieved through the comprehensive analysis of a significantly high number of COVID cases. Given how recent and unknown this disease is, and its inherent epidemic nature, there is a limited number of cases at individual medical institutions. The limitation of number of cases per institution becomes even more relevant when isolating subpopulations with specific health conditions and across the lifespan. This proposed study will aim to overcome the above-mentioned challenges by supporting the formation of a consortium comprising multiple medical institutions in the U.S.: COMBATCOVID (Consortium for Multisite Biomedical Analytics and Trials on COVID-19). COMBATCOVID will bring together electronic health records (EHR) data from multiple participating institutions into a shared centralized database. As part of the COMBATCOVID effort, biorepository data of COVID-19 patients collected by some of the participating institutions will also be shared and linked to the respective EHR data. The COMBATCOVID consortium will be responsible for transferring EHR data pertaining to participating institutions interested in contributing EHR data to the N3C database. PROJECT NARRATIVE: COMBATCOVID The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every corner of the globe and has redefined healthcare throughout the United States. To adequately understand the virus much more data is needed, necessitating sharing of data across multiple institutions. The COMBATCOVID (Consortium for Multisite Biomedical Analytics and Trials on COVID-19) initiative will support regional and national efforts by forming a consortium comprising multiple medical institutions in the U.S. to create a shared centralized database of COVID-related EHR data.",Clinical and Translational Science Award,10183901,UL1TR001445,"['2019-nCoV', 'Affect', 'Area', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronavirus', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Marshal', 'Medical', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumonia', 'Procedures', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States', 'Upper respiratory tract', 'Venous', 'Viral Pneumonia', 'Virus', 'biobank', 'central database', 'cohort', 'coronavirus disease', 'data sharing', 'demographics', 'design', 'ethnic minority population', 'health data', 'improved', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'member', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'racial minority', 'response', 'structured data', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unstructured data', 'venous thromboembolism']",NCATS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,UL1,2020,768511,0.0691538033066425
"Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics PROJECT SUMMARY The widespread adoption of EHRs has enabled the collection of massive amounts of digital ophthalmic data which have great potential for secondary use in research, quality improvement, and clinical decision support. While the amount of digital ophthalmic data recorded in the EHR is substantial and could be analyzed using the latest techniques for big data, questions about the quality of the data are a barrier to its reuse. Now that the American Academy of Ophthalmology has aggregated digital ophthalmic data from the EHR into the IRIS Registry, data quality is even more imperative for reaching the potential of the registry. To date, there has not be a comprehensive evaluation of the data quality of digital ophthalmic data, nor have there been any solutions for improving its quality. These are important gaps that will limit the utility of EHR data as a tool for knowledge discovery in ophthalmology. The goal of this grant is to assess the quality of digital ophthalmic exam data in order to improve its ability to be reused for research. Our hypothesis is that studying the variability of data quality in large datasets will provide insights into improving its quality. The first aim employs an established framework for data quality analysis to assess the intrinsic quality of a single institution’s EHR data as well as its fitness for use--the ability to be applied to a particular research scenario. In this proposal, we are evaluating the data’s ability to identify patient cohorts for clinical trials and to accurately calculate outcome based clinical quality measures. The variability in data’s quality and fitness among providers, subspecialties, diagnoses, and visit types will be analyzed. The second aim validates the analysis of the first aim by repeating it for all of the ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry. For this analysis, the differences in quality and fitness between institutions and EHR vendors will also be assessed, along with the barriers to data quality and reuse. For both aims, ophthalmology experts will review the results to make recommendations for improving data quality and utility for digital ophthalmic data. In the future, these recommendations will provide a direction for correcting these quality issues and for ultimately advancing knowledge discovery in ophthalmic care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) have not yet reached their potential for transforming healthcare, particularly for reusing clinical data for research. The American Academy of Ophthalmology has aggregated ophthalmic data from the EHR into the IRIS Registry, and data quality is even more imperative to achieve to reach the potential of this registry. Using methodological data quality analysis, we will analyze the quality of a single institution’s ophthalmic data and again for multiple institutions’ ophthalmic data in the IRIS Registry, documenting barriers for data quality and reuse that will lead to improving knowledge discovery from this data.",Improving Quality of Electronic Health Record Ophthalmic Data for Big Data Analytics,9953684,R21EY031443,"['Academy', 'Adoption', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Exfoliation Syndrome', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Iris', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Ophthalmology', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Secondary to', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'cohort', 'data framework', 'data harmonization', 'data quality', 'data registry', 'data reuse', 'data submission', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'research study', 'tool', 'treatment comparison']",NEI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,231000,0.04856067762085071
"Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data PROJECT SUMMARY Large electronic health record research (EHR) data integrated with -omics data from linked biorepositories have expanded opportunities for precision medicine research. These integrated datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based personalized cancer risk and progression prediction models, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice and ultimately realize the promise of precision oncology. However, efficiently and effectively using EHR for cancer research remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, obtaining precise event time information such as time of cancer recurrence is a major bottleneck in using EHR for precision medicine research due to the requirement of laborious medical record review and the lack of documentation. Simple estimates of the event time based on billing or procedure codes may poorly approximate the true event time. Naive use of such estimated event times can lead to highly biased estimates due to the approximation error. Such biases impose challenges to performing pragmatic trials when the study endpoint is time to events and captured using EHR. The overall goal of this proposal is to fill these methodological gaps in risk assessment for cancer research using EHR data, which will advance our ability to achieve the promise of precision oncology. Statistical algorithms and software will be developed to (i) automatically assign event time information using longitudinally recorded EHR information; and (ii) to perform accurate risk assessment using noisy proxies of event times. The proposed tools for risk assessment using imperfect EHR data without requiring extensive manual chart review could greatly improve the utility of EHR for oncology research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal addresses major methodological gaps in effectively utilizing EHR data for risk assessment due to the noisy nature of EHR data. We propose novel statistical algorithms and software to (i) efficiently annotate event time by combining multiple longitudinally recorded code information and (ii) to provide precise risk estimates using noisy proxies of event times. By drawing upon the rich albeit imperfect data from bio-repository linked EHR, our algorithms will advance our ability to use EHR data for precision oncology research.",Semi-supervised Algorithms for Risk Assessment with Noisy EHR Data,9955220,R21CA242940,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Boston', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proxy', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Time', 'adjudicate', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2020,177510,0.14293505847630225
"EHR-Based Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Familial Hypercholesterolemia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a dramatically increased lifetime risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Available data suggest substantial under treatment of individuals with FH, and it is estimated that <5% of prevalent FH cases in the US are diagnosed and treated. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to reduce mortality and morbidity from FH. We will develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm for rapid and efficient identification of FH cases thereby enabling EHR-based surveillance of FH. We will deploy the phenotyping algorithm in the population-based setting of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to estimate prevalence and provide hitherto unavailable data on awareness, detection and control of FH. We will develop CDS to help care providers manage FH patients and an FH-specific decision aid to facilitate shared decision making related to lipid-lowering therapy and screening of family members. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage the following resources: a) the electronic phenotyping expertise available in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network; b) the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), that links medical records of Olmsted County MN residents thereby capturing nearly all health care delivered to residents of the community; and c) expertise in developing and deploying CDS in the EHR and in creating decision aids for disclosing cardiovascular risk and the benefits of lipid-lowering drugs. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop and validate an electronic phenotyping algorithm to rapidly identify FH cases from the EHR. Aim 2. Conduct an e- epidemiology study to obtain hitherto unknown data regarding prevalence, awareness, detection, control of FH in a population-based setting in the US. Aim 3. a) Develop EHR-based tools to help care providers manage FH and facilitate shared decision making and cascade screening and b) assess outcomes after implementation of CDS and decision aid. The proposed research will enable rapid identification of FH in EHRs, provide hitherto unavailable data on the burden of FH in the community, facilitate EHR-based strategies for early detection, increase awareness of FH among care providers, provide guidance for management of FH at point of care and help both patients and providers make informed decisions about drug therapy and screening of family members. These are critical steps for early detection and treatment of FH to reduce the burden of premature ASCVD due to this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a relatively common genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart attack or sudden cardiac death. The proposed research will develop electronic health record (EHR)-based strategies to prevent adverse outcomes such as heart attack in FH patients. These include methods to rapidly identify FH patients, estimate prevalence of FH and develop clinical decision support to help care providers manage FH patients.

"Polygenic Risk Scores for Healthier African American Families PROJECT ABSTRACT  To advance the health and care of children, as in eMERGE II & III, CCHMC will assemble a birth cohort in eMERGE IV, ascertained on pregnant or recently delivered self-identified African-American (AA) women and their babies, along with the willing fathers and siblings. The eMERGE IV collection will be the inaugural effort in a new CCHMC initiative, a birth cohort of mother and baby dyads called My Genome and Me, Cincinnati (MGMC), conceived to develop an understanding of the genomics that informs health and disease risk, beginning at birth and continuing across the lifespan with dyads randomized at enrollment to genotyping with return of results as neonates or later as older children. Our eMERGE IV project will directly grapple with the ethical issues raised by return of results to families with different considerations operating in babies, siblings and parents regarding the particular phenotypes being studied. For eMERGE IV, as site-specific phenotypes, we nominate Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer. We will exploit the work done that will enable developing polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and genomic risk estimates (GREs) for these conditions in addition to the 15 others chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and anticipate developing consensus across the Network for the PRSs and GREs applied. The care of families will exploit the harmonization of the electronic health records between the adult and pediatric hospitals, which has been achieved with the Maternal and Infant Data Hub (MIDH) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. For data quality control we will evaluate discrepancies between eMERGE IV genotyping and low read depth coverage (LRDC) genotypes (LRDC sequencing will be at CCHMC expense.) We will collect preferences and attitudes of our local AA community with respect to genomic results and return of results. We will develop health risk-reducing recommendations and return GREs with and without actionable PRSs to assess the influence of PRSs on the adherence to risk-mitigating recommendations. We will use SMART on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technologies and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) through the electronic health record (EHR)-integrated clinical decision support (CDS)-Hooks framework to provide CDS to both the adult and pediatric EHR systems. We will periodically revise PRSs and GREs and return changes when indicated. CCHMC will provide LRDC sequencing from >17,000 DNA AA samples from children in the CCHMC biobank and ≥50,000 subjects in total for genotype generation and mitochondrial DNA variant analysis. Federated geocoding will be available to all eMERGE IV sites from CCHMC. To disseminate genomic practice within CCHMC, across the Network, and in general, CCHMC will provide services to advance PRSs and GREs for specific conditions, starting with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, migraine headache, and suicide. In sum, CCHMC presents an aggressive program use genomic medicine to advance toward better health outcomes focused on underserved AA dyads of neonates and mothers with their families. Project Narrative Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) proposes to join eMERGE IV by enrolling of local Cincinnati African-American newborn babies and their mothers with available fathers and brothers and sisters to develop predictions of their risk for Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer (along with 15 disorders chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and disorders chosen by CCHMC Faculty) using genetic variation, environmental factors, and family history. We will test whether knowledge of having a higher genetic risk for these disorders will motivate closer adherence to health recommendations made to reduce disease risk.",Polygenic Risk Scores for Healthier African American Families,9988603,U01HG011172,"['7 year old', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent Psychiatry', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Ancillary Study', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Attitude', 'Birth', 'Brothers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Repository', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethical Issues', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Fathers', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fetus', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mothers', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Siblings', 'Sister', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Sum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biobank', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'data hub', 'data modeling', 'data quality', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'minority subjects', 'neonate', 'polygenic risk score', 'preference', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'programs', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHGRI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,U01,2020,1338768,-0.011004649027196833
"Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa Project Summary Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a neglected, prevalent, chronic, stigmatizing, and debilitating disease that has recently been prioritized for study by NIAMS. Evidence suggests that some HS patients choose to self-manage symptoms remaining unconnected to healthcare, and some seek medical care for repeated outbreaks of boils but never receive a diagnosis. Such ‘hidden populations’ create challenges for designing research studies that are generalizable. Precision medicine initiatives and resources offer opportunities to rapidly increase our knowledge about biological causes of HS and to improve the care that HS patients receive. For example, the NIH has made considerable investments in the development of data repositories that link genetic data to EHR for hundreds of thousands of patients, including the NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network and the NIH-funded All of Us Research Program. Columbia University investigators are integral members of these nationwide programs, both as a recruitment site, as well as a data and research center (5U01HG008680, 1OT2OD026556). Engaging research participants who are willing to contribute longitudinal data is a major obstacle to precision medicine initiatives. The public’s use of the Internet and social media to obtain and exchange health-related information has created opportunities to rapidly and efficiently assemble large longitudinal cohorts, yet there are important differences from traditional research methods and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Columbia University is at the forefront of the development and application of these methods. A major challenge to implementing precision medicine arises from patients who share a diagnosis but have different biological causes of disease. HS patients have a high burden of comorbidities and we hypothesize that sets of comorbidities that tend to present together in individual patients can be used to identify biologically relevant disease subtypes. Here we will use three approaches to identify patterns of comorbidities within patients, to characterize the generalizability of the results from studies conducted in EHR, and to use genetic data to biologically validate comorbidities and resolve causality underlying disease associations. Training in biomedical informatics and Internet-based survey research will allow the applicant to use EHR data and Internet resources for assembling cohorts to conduct these studies, and complement her previous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, molecular biology and human genetics, providing fluency across several domains that are crucial for advancing precision medicine initiatives. Completion of this proposal will achieve the applicant’s long-term goal of obtaining advanced training aimed at implementing precision medicine in the treatment of skin disease. Project Narrative This project addresses the imperative needs of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) patients who suffer from pain, stigma, diminished quality of life, decreased work productivity, and increased healthcare costs that arise from managing a difficult-to-treat, debilitating disease with a high burden of comorbidities. We will conduct studies of HS comorbidities to identify biologically distinct subclasses of HS in large samples of patients using data in electronic health records and data collected from Internet surveys. This work will improve the precision of HS diagnoses and set up the infrastructure for future large-scale studies of HS.",Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa,9977561,K01AR075111,"['Abscess', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Anogenital region', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axilla', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Furuncles', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inguinal region', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Stigmatization', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'online resource', 'patient engagement', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'research study', 'skin disorder', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'symptom self management', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2020,121288,0.03176822011248221
