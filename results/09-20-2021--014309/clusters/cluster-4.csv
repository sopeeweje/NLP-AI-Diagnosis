"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,9820438,K99MH118359,"['10 year old', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'artificial neural network', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'neural correlate', 'periadolescent', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'symptom cluster']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,157009,0.0018982019621397164
"Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care Project Summary/Abstract The best predictor of future injury is previous injury. Unfortunately, this has not changed in a quarter century, despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and the associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical treatment and/or clinical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Even with formal care, injured athletes are two- to four times (in extreme cases 100 times) more likely to suffer a second injury for up to two years after RTP. This is even more alarming given that 65% of initial sports-related injuries affect children and young adults (ages 5-24 years), setting them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. These data implicate the initial injury event as the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. Thus, an urgent need exists to revolutionize the current standard of post- injury care through better identification and targeting of deficits that underlie second injury risk to enable everyone to stay physically active and healthy for their whole lives. To address this need, we propose a pioneering approach that capitalizes on the biological concept of Phenotypic Plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete’s functional adaptability across different performance environments. Here PP is computed based on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that reflect the functional movement capability of the athlete. The overall objective of this proposal is, therefore, to develop a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach for second injury prevention through the development of a systematic bioinformatics-driven approach for PP profile construction, and the training of genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence to establish treatment type and magnitude for precision enhancement of PP. The result of the proposed work will be a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach via two expected outcomes: (1) a formalized phenotypic precision medicine approach to objectively quantify behavioral plasticity, and (2) the successful implementation of a platform leveraging genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence integrated with mixed reality for performance prediction. This platform will support delivery of personalized treatments for PP enhancement. These objectives are the critical first step for the development of a generalizable precision medicine approach that will revolutionize rehabilitation and finally stem the tide of second injury in sport. This contribution will be significant to push back against the initial injury tipping point and, in doing so, create a pathway for injured athletes to return safely to physical activity and to maintain a long-term healthy lifestyle. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the proposed platform will lead to fewer young men and women who suffer from second injury and the negative effects that lead to poorer long-term health. The project is relevant to NIH’s mission because the knowledge gained will be used to optimize new precision assessment and treatment strategies to prevent injury, and this will enhance health and reduce the burden of athletic injury.",Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care,9723527,R21EB027865,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Services', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral plasticity', 'complex biological systems', 'environmental change', 'evidence base', 'fitness', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'indexing', 'injured', 'injury prevention', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'medical specialties', 'mixed reality', 'multimodal data', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult', 'young man', 'young woman']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2019,326700,-0.01710424815930918
"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies). Ultimately, this research aims to improve the lives and wellbeing of those suffering from spinal cord injury. Successful completion of this research will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” ! 1!",MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury,9674165,R03HD094577,"['Acute', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Correlation Studies', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Event', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Length', 'Life Expectancy', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotor training', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Team', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rogaine', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord damage', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dorsal column', 'early detection biomarkers', 'expectation', 'functional independence', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'motor deficit', 'motor function recovery', 'motor recovery', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'restoration', 'secondary outcome', 'social', 'spinal cord imaging']",NICHD,REGIS UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,96034,-0.022371183439520333
"Ethical Considerations for Language Modeling within Brain-Computer Interfaces Project Summary Machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have the potential to transform communication for patients with neurodegenerative disease through personalized and real-time augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. Individuals with severe communication impairments who can no longer control their daily conversations or participate in previous life roles want AAC devices. And they want them to work – to be reliable, effective, and fast. ML and NLP are emerging as promising tools to bridge current technology and next generation devices for individuals with the most severe speech and physical impairments, like the RSVP Keyboard™, a brain-computer interface (BCI) being developed by the parent grant. BCI systems for communication are referred to as AAC-BCIs. NLP efforts to combine large public data sets with private data sets, such as personal email messages, promise to give individuals with communication impairments their own personalized language models, models that are sufficiently robust to get closer to real-time communication. The focus on getting AAC-BCIs to work with machine learning, however, has led to a critical oversight in the field: an inadequate understanding of why individuals want next-generation devices and what trade-offs they are willing to make for faster and more personalized communication. The turn to ML brings this oversight into sharp relief. Individuals should provide input about the data sets used to construct their personal language models, but this raises important ethical questions about what individuals value, how they understand their identity, and what trade-offs they are willing to make relative to their personalized communication data. The goal of this supplement is to fill this gap in understanding so that researchers can implement ML into next generation AAC-BCI systems in a way that is sensitive to the ethical concerns of future users. There are four components to this ethics supplement: (1) to design a toolbox of ethics vignettes tailored to ethical concerns raised by both BCI communication and ML; (2) to administer monthly vignette-based online ethics surveys to individuals with severe communication impairments due to motor neuron disease (e.g., ALS) (n=25) or movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease) (n=25); (3) to conduct semi-structured vignette-based interviews with individuals with pre- clinical or mild communication impairment due to motor neuron disease (n=10) or movement disorder (n=10). Components (2) and (3) will employ an iterative, parallel mixed-method approach. Trends in Likert-style online responses to ethics vignettes in the severe communication impairment cohort will be used to inform and modify the semi-structured interview prompts asked of the pre-clinical or mild impairment cohort. In parallel, themes emerging from direct content analysis of interviews will be used to refine online survey questions. Results of this iterative, mix-methods approach will be used (4) to outline a framework of core ethical domains and preliminary tools (vignettes and discussion prompts) that AAC-BCI researchers can use to assess ethical concerns while developing and iteratively refining communication technology for personalized language models. Project Narrative The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies.

"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9688867,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'after-school program', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2019,416786,0.001516153445174404
"SCH: INT: Computational Tools for Avoidaint/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder  Intellectual Merit: This project will for the first time provide the fundamental tools to integrate unique multimodal data toward screening, diagnosis, and intervention in eating disorders, with an initial focus on children with ARFID and related developmental and health disorders. This work is critical for enriching the understanding of healthy development and for broadening the foundations of behavioral data science. ARFID ·motivates the development of new computer vision and data analysis tools critical for the analysis of multidimensional behavioral data. The main aims are: 1. Develop and user individualized and integrated continuous facial affect coding from videos to discern affective motivations for food avoidance, critical due to the unique sensory aspects of eating disorders, and resulting from active stimulation via friendly and carefully designed images/videos and real food presentation; 2. Use data analysis and machine learning to derive sensory profiles based on patterns of food consumption and preference from existing unique datasets of selective eaters; and 3. Translate the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 into the clinic and home to assess the capacity of these tools to define a threshold of clinically significant food avoidance, to detect change in acceptability of food with repeated presentations, and to examine and modify the accuracy of our food suggestion algorithms. Broader Impacts: The impact of this application comprises two broad domains. First is the derivation of processes, tools, and strategies to analyze very disparate data across multiple levels of analysis and to codify those strategies to inform similar future work, in particular incorporating automatic behavioral coding. Second is the exploitation of these tools to address questions about the emergence of healthy/unhealthy food selectivity across the lifespan, including recommendation delivery via apps and at-home recordings. The health impact of even partial success in this project is very broad and significant. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project via the 6-weeks summer research program at the Information Initiative at Duke, a center dedicated to the fundamentals of data science and its applications; via the co-Pl's research lab devoted to eating disorders; and via the Pl's project dedicated to training undergraduate students to address eating disorders of their friends via an anonymous app. Outreach and dissemination will follow the broad use of the developed app, both in the clinic and the general population, including the Pl's connections with low-income and under-represented bi-lingual preK. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening mental illnesses affecting the general population; -90% of individuals never receive treatment, in part due to lack of awareness and access. Individuals with eating disorders experience a diminished quality of life, high mental and physical illness comorbidities, and an existence marked by profound loneliness and isolation. Combining expertise in eating disorders with computer vision and machine learning, we bring for the first time data science to this health challenge.

"Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this R01 project is to develop an automated assessment system that can capitalize on state of the art sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable accurate and early detection of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities. In the USA, 1 in 10 infants are born at risk for these disabilities. For children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, early treatment in the first year of life improves long-term outcomes. However, we are currently held back by inadequacies of available clinical tests to measure and predict impairment. Existing tests are hard to administer, require specialized training, and have limited long- term predictive value. There is a critical need to develop an objective, accurate, easy-to-use tool for the early prediction of long-term physical disability. The field of pediatrics and infant development would greatly benefit from a quantitative score that would correlate with existing clinical measures used today to detect movement impairments in very young infants. To realize a new generation of tests that will be easy to administer, we will obtain large datasets of infants playing in an instrumented gym or simply being recorded while moving in a supine posture. Video and sensor data analyses will convert movement into feature vectors based on our knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach will use machine learning to relate these feature vectors to currently recommended clinical tests or other ground truth information. The power of this design is that algorithms can utilize many aspects of movement to produce the relevant scores. Our preliminary data allows us to lay the following aims: 1)Aim 1: To assess concurrent validity of a multimodal instrumented gym with existing clinical tools. Here, using 150 infants (75 with early brain injury and 75 controls), we will focus on converting data from an instrumented gym into estimates of the standard clinical tests; 2)Aim 2: To develop a computer vision-based algorithm to quantify infant motor performance from single camera video. Here using video data from 1200 infants (400 with early brain injury, 400 preterm without early brain injury, 400 controls), plus those gathered from Aim 1 and Aim 3, we will extract pose data from single-camera video recordings and convert these into kinematic features and relevant scores needed to classify infant movement; 3)Aim3: To discover the features related to long-term motor development. Here we will convert data collected longitudinally from 50 infants (25 with early brain injury and 25 controls) using both instrumented gym and video recordings into estimates standard clinical tests change over time and track features over developmental timescales. These three aims spearhead the use of real world behavior for movement scoring. Our aims will bring us closer to a universal non-invasive test for early detection of neurodevelopmental disabilities and lay the groundwork for long-term prediction of disability. But above all, it promises to scale to infants worldwide, producing an affordable tool to aid in infant health assessment.

"Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Because suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide and suicide attempt) significantly contributes to global disease and financial burden, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, the World Health Organization, and prominent researchers have called for the need to develop and improve prediction models for suicidal behavior. The period after contact with a health care professional is a particularly high-risk period, suggesting that prediction of suicidal behavior in the short-term after contact (i.e., defined as within one year in most studies) would address a critical need in the field to aid intervention efforts. However, previous short-term research has been limited by numerous factors, including a lack of research on youth samples, an overreliance on self-report measures or electronic health records, and the frequent examination of bivariate associations between only one predictor and suicidal behavior. The overall objective of the current proposal is to utilize several algorithms and assess their relative performance in the prediction of short-term suicidal behavior after contact with an outpatient specialist (defined as within 1, 6, and 12 months) using an unparalleled dataset. I will use data from a prospective, large-scale register of all outpatient mental health specialist visits among youth in Stockholm County, Sweden, consisting of approximately 160,000 visits by the onset of the current award. These individuals can be linked to population-based registers assessing a broad range of information (e.g., medical problems, academic information, neighborhood factors, parental psychopathology), which is a significant advantage over prior literature primarily studying demographic and psychiatric predictors in isolation. The central hypothesis is that the examination of numerous predictors within a large sample and the use of advanced statistical methods will significantly improve upon previous suicidal behavior prediction, which has remained slightly above chance. To achieve the overall objective, the current proposal is designed to apply machine learning algorithms through two specific aims: Aim 1: Apply variable selection algorithms that determine a limited number of salient predictors and, therefore, maximize interpretability; Aim 2: Apply ensemble algorithms that aggregate machine learning models and, therefore, maximize predictive power. The current proposal will significantly contribute to the field by examining short-term risk using machine learning techniques among a youth, outpatient sample, including varying follow-up windows and predictors across domains. Finally, the results from the current proposal will have positive impact by informing both 1) basic research through the identification of at-risk subgroups based on numerous predictors, and 2) the creation of a prediction tool that will aid in clinical practice. Project Narrative Over the past 50 years, prediction of suicidal behavior has remained slightly above chance levels, significantly hindering the development of effective intervention strategies. Because the majority of those who attempt or die by suicide are in contact with a health care professional within the year prior to their death, the current proposal serves to fill a critical gap in suicidal behavior prediction by exploring prediction methods for suicidal behavior among youth in the short-term (i.e., within 1, 6, and 12 months) after contact with an outpatient mental health specialist using an unparalleled dataset. Findings from the current proposal will have implications for clinical practice by identifying high-risk individuals for short-term suicidal behavior and aid clinical decision-making.",Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach,9835007,F31MH121039,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sweden', 'Techniques', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'World Health Organization', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'translational pipeline']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F31,2019,45016,-0.0631310092993651
"New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions PROJECT SUMMARY Globally, tuberculosis (TB) kills more people each year than any other infectious disease, but around 40% of TB cases go undiagnosed each year. This leads to continued transmission and a slow rate of decline in global TB incidence. Community-based TB screening interventions are one strategy for increasing the early diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis. Knowledge is lacking on when community-based TB screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and on the impact of these interventions on TB transmission. This study addresses the first of these knowledge gaps by identifying epidemiologic signals that predict high yields for community-based TB screening, and by assessing barriers to optimal implementation of community-based screening programs. It addresses the second knowledge gap by measuring transmission within communities that receive TB screening interventions, and by identifying potential sites of transmission both within and outside the community. Aim 1 applies random forest regression to data from a community-based screening program to create a decision tree that uses information about past TB patients to predict whether a commnity is likely to have high levels of undiagnosed TB in the present. Aim 2 is a mixed-methods study focusing on people who were missed by TB screening interventions, which will help understand the barriers to successful implementation. Aim 3 uses whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates to determine the proportion of TB cases attributable to recent transmission within intervention communities, using this metric to evaluate the impact of screening interventions on transmission. Aim 4 uses social network analysis to identify sites of transmission within and outside intervention communities. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce global TB morbidity through improved community-based screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study seeks to understand (a) when community-based tuberculosis screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and (b) the impact these interventions have on tuberculosis transmission. This knowledge will improve community-based tuberculosis screening interventions and thus contribute to the reduction of global tuberculosis morbidity.",New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions,9781984,DP2MD015102,"['Address', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epidemiology', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical sequencing', 'community intervention', 'improved', 'novel strategies', 'random forest', 'screening', 'screening program', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIMHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,DP2,2019,2353629,-0.0034803676960779785
"Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping ABSTRACT  Symptom-based classification approaches based on the DSM 5 are often not supported by epidemiological, genetic, and clinical neuroimaging research and may impede the advancement of interventions that target the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health disorders. A novel alternative to classifying psychopathology based on presenting clinical symptoms is to identify neurobiologically-informed biotypes. Individuals are clustered according to shared patterns of brain dysfunction using data-driven machine learning techniques to reveal the heterogeneous biological mechanisms that underlie comorbid disorders. Internalizing symptoms often first begin during development, suggesting that this is a critical period of vulnerability. Additionally, strong sex differences are found in anxiety and depressive symptoms, starting in adolescence. Thus, studies are needed that examine sex differences in the neurobiological mechanisms associated with internalizing symptoms during development. The purpose of the current study is to uncover the neurobiological heterogeneity associated with internalizing symptoms in youth. During the K99 phase, Aim 1 will use machine-learning techniques to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity among youth with anxiety and depressive disorders using multimodal neuroimaging data from a large community-based sample of over 1,200 youth studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; Training phase). We will test these heterogeneous patterns on a hold-out sample from the same cohort to examine the model’s validity (Validation phase). While the PNC provides an ideal dataset for developing a model, it does not have paradigms relevant to fear and anxiety that would allow us to identify important phenotypic differences between biotypes. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the generalizability of this model in an independent sample collected during the R00 phase, and further characterize these biotypes using pertinent measures related to error and reward processing. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate how sex differences in brain development associate with heterogeneous neural patterns in internalizing symptoms. Dr. Kaczkurkin’s long-term goal is to establish an independent research program where she will use advanced multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to study the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders in youth. This study will provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on the PNC database at the University of Pennsylvania to develop a well-validated model while also collecting a refined independent dataset, which will provide Dr. Kaczkurkin with the training and experience needed to transition to an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will provide critical knowledge regarding the neurobiological heterogeneity in youth with mood and anxiety disorders. A greater comprehension of how abnormalities in brain function give rise to these symptoms in adolescence is critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. Such knowledge would benefit public health by reducing the costs and burden of internalizing symptoms on the society at large. !",Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping,9705932,K99MH117274,"['Adolescence', 'Affective', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Atrophic', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Comprehension', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Phobias', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'critical period', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'male', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'programs', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'reward processing', 'supervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2019,11937,-0.015072779718470111

"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not.

"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9613247,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'computer science', 'craving', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2019,165108,0.0055587465795541025
"Deep Learning of Street View Imagery to assess Urban Green Space Relationships with Mental Health:  A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY The built environment is an important modifiable determinant of human health, yet our ability to understand its effects on human health have been limited by the lack of scalable data on specific components (and exposures) of the built environment. The emergence of ubiquitous geo-referenced imagery in the United States (e.g. Google Street View Imagery), combined with recent advances in image processing using deep learning algorithms, offers unprecedented opportunity for measuring street-level built environment features at scales needed for population-based research. To develop and demonstrate the potential of deep learning algorithms for environmental health research we will: develop methods to assess green space features using street view imagery and deep learning algorithms; create new deep learning algorithms to predict urban green space quality, stress reduction and restorative potential; and apply new street view measures to 9,070 adult Twin Pairs in the Washington Twin Registry to determine associations between green space and mental health. Our proposed study will dramatically move the field of environmental health forward by provided a completely new, transferable and scalable exposure assessment method for assessing built environment exposures relevant to human health and provide robust information on how urban green space influences mental health. Overall, our new approach will provide rich new data sources for environmental epidemiologists, city planners, policy makers and neighborhoods and communities at large.

"Prospective Health Outcomes and Inflammatory Biomarkers Associated with e-Cigarette Use Project Summary. This project is designed to identify validated biomarkers for use in the assessment of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) by the FDA. Since the introduction of ENDS, commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products. With the goal of validated biomarker discovery in two independent cohorts, the COPDGene and UCSD ENDS studies, we propose to identify ENDS-related inflammatory biomarkers in ENDS only and dual users and relate these biomarkers to five-year lung health outcomes. COPDGene is an ongoing, longitudinal study of >6,000 current and former traditional cigarette (t-cig) smokers enriched for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with detailed longitudinal lung phenotyping data (including chest CT), genome-wide blood RNA-seq, and proteomic data. The UCSD ENDS Study is a controlled study of young ENDS only users and controls with detailed assessment of inflammatory biomarkers in the oropharynx, airways and blood.  Biomarkers used as validated surrogate measures must be 1) associated with ENDS use, 2) predictive of health outcomes, and 3) have a strong biological rationale. We hypothesize that inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use will be predictive of five-year lung health effects. In Aim 1 of this proposal, discovery of inflammatory transcriptomic and proteomic biomarkers of ENDS exposure will be performed in subjects from the COPDGene five-year study visit, and biomarkers will be validated in two independent sets of subjects from the COPDGene ten-year visit and the UCSD ENDS Study. In Aim 2 we will identify antibody-specific adaptive immune response biomarkers of ENDS exposure using adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq). Auto-antibodies are biomarkers that are associated with the degree of lung damage in COPD. AIRR-seq is a powerful tool for inflammatory biomarker discovery that characterizes an individual’s decades-long history of antibody responses. In Aim 3 we will use machine learning predictive models to relate ENDS-associated biomarker panels to five-year lung health outcomes from COPDGene. The investigative team for this grant is well-positioned to identify novel inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use. The COPDGene and UCSD cohorts have the detailed lung phenotyping and molecular characterization necessary to discover and clinically validate biomarkers in two important populations of ENDS users, i.e. ENDS only and dual users. Public Health Relevance: Since the introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users).

"Developing Objective Assessment of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior for Adults with Down Syndrome There is an essential gap in understanding the levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior of adults with Down syndrome (DS): objective assessment of these behaviors with accelerometers has not been developed for this population. If this gap remains unfilled, it may impede efforts to objectively quantify the problem of inactivity in adults with DS and to develop effective interventions for improving physical activity and reducing health disparities in this population. Objective assessment of physical activity and sedentary behavior for adults with DS will advance by considering their pathologically low aerobic fitness. It may also improve by applying to accelerometer output innovative machine-learning modes. The long-term goals of the present applicants are to understand the determinants of physical activity and sedentariness in adults with DS and develop effective interventions for improving their physical activity and health. The objective of this application, in pursuit of the long-term goals, is to calibrate accelerometer output for measuring physical activity and sedentary behavior in adults with DS. The central hypothesis is that machine learning applied to accelerometer output will permit accurate prediction of physical activity type and intensity in adults with DS. The hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data and previous work that has successfully developed machine learning models for individuals without disabilities. The rationale for the proposed research is that accurate measurement of physical activity and sedentariness will lead to better monitoring of these behaviors in adults with DS and to more precise quantification of the effects of interventions for improving their health. Guided by the applicants’ preliminary data and previous work, and a critical review of the empirical knowledge-base, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following two specific aims: (1) compare the relationship between accelerometer output and energy expenditure across various physical activities and sedentary behaviors between adults with and without DS; and (2) develop machine learning models from accelerometer output and evaluate their accuracy for predicting physical activity type and energy expenditure in adults with and without DS. To achieve Aim 1, output from hip- and wrist-worn triaxial accelerometers and energy expenditure expressed relative to aerobic fitness will be measured during physical activities and sedentary behaviors in adults with and without DS. To achieve Aim 2, machine learning models for predicting physical activity type and intensity will be developed in samples of adults with and without DS, and their prediction accuracy will be tested in two additional samples. The approach is innovative, because: (a) it will calibrate accelerometer output while accounting for aerobic fitness; (b) it will refine calibration by utilizing machine learning models. The proposed research is significant because it will allow researchers and public health agencies to more precisely monitor the levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentariness in adults with DS. Such knowledge is critical for the development of interventions for improving physical activity, health, and quality of life in adults with DS. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing valid objective assessment of physical activity and sedentary behavior in adults with Down syndrome is an essential step towards designing effective interventions for improving physical activity, fitness, health, and quality of life in these persons. Therefore, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NICHD’s mission that pertains to ensuring the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of all people through optimal rehabilitation.",Developing Objective Assessment of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior for Adults with Down Syndrome,9730779,R15HD098660,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Calibration', 'Data', 'Down Syndrome', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinesiology', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mississippi', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'design', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fitness', 'graduate student', 'hands-on learning', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'national surveillance', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'public health intervention', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'therapy development', 'undergraduate student']",NICHD,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,423824,-0.05730519995273377
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9760006,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,501996,-0.020254871208012303
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome,9885029,R01MH119185,"['22q11.2', '3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Rhinometry', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ear', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nasal cavity', 'Neurobiology', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Cortex', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oral cavity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Societies', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conotruncal anomaly face syndrome', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdeletion', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory sulcus', 'precision medicine', 'psychotic symptoms', 'resilience', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,746845,-0.016453717546448768
"Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future infection Project Summary / Abstract Background: Trachoma, caused by ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. This goal will be achieved in many countries, but some regions in Ethiopia maintain persistently high levels of infection despite >10 years of intensive control activities. A small proportion of the population likely harbors the majority of trachoma infections, with foci of infection (“hotspots”) at or below the village scale; the operational challenge is accurately predicting where they are with existing data. Advances in machine learning and spatial data science have demonstrated marked improvements in the spatial resolution of predictions for diseases like malaria. Among available biomarkers of trachoma, IgG antibody responses in children could enable more accurate predictions because they integrate exposure over time and reflect recent transmission. Aims: The principal aims of this study are to evaluate whether antibody measurements can identify stable hotspots of trachoma infection, and whether a novel machine learning approach can accurately predict village- level trachoma infection forward in time (up to 3 years). We hypothesize that infection will be concentrated in the population and that hotspots of infection will be at the village level. We further hypothesize that antibody measurements in young children will provide a stable source of information about trachoma transmission that will enable us to accurately predict villages with high levels of future C. trachomatis infection. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we will draw on measurements from a well characterized population across 40 villages enrolled in a NIH-funded cluster randomized trial in Ethiopia’s Amhara Region (U10-EY023939). The three-year trial is designed to measure the effect of improved water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) on trachoma infection in the absence of azithromycin treatment. The trial has collected clinical and biomarker measurements from approximately 2,400 children ages 0-9 years at enrollment and in annual visits over 3 years. We will characterize the spatial scale of transmission using the !-statistic, which equals the relative risk of infection within different distances of cases. We will use a permutation-based, spatial scan statistic to identify hotspots using IgG antibody and PCR measures in each year, and will determine if they are stable over time. Using geospatial ensemble machine learning, we will predict trachoma seroprevalence as a function of remotely sensed, geospatial information and limited enrollment characteristics. We will rank order villages by predicted seroprevalence, and will assess the proportion of PCR C. trachomatis infections in top-ranked villages 1, 2, and 3 years later. We will repeat the analysis using predicted clinical symptoms as a comparator. The development of methods to make accurate, fine-scale predictions of future C. trachomatis infection will lay the groundwork for a future adaptive randomized trial that preferentially allocates more intensive intervention to villages predicted at enrollment to have high future levels of infection. Project Narrative / Lay Language Description Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Trachoma control programs target and monitor activities at the level of districts, but it is likely that infection hotspots are concentrated at much smaller scales and could be missed in district-level averages. We propose to combine antibody-based measures of exposure with state-of-the-art machine learning to develop predictions of trachoma infection at the scale of individual villages in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which would represent a substantial increase in the resolution of information available to guide control and monitoring efforts.",Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future infection,9805550,R03AI147128,"['Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Azithromycin', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Cholera', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethiopia', 'Eye Infections', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handwashing', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hygiene', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relative Risks', 'Resolution', 'Sanitation', 'Scanning', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Water', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'novel', 'population based', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'remote sensing', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R03,2019,1299,-0.017740927211955474
"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"Rethinking Electronic Fetal Monitoring to Improve Perinatal Outcomes and Reduce Frequency of Operative Vaginal and Cesarean Deliveries The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to fetal hypoxia and ischemia. Its established weaknesses include: 1) the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns and 2) the widespread use of unproven surrogates for relevant fetal hypoxic and/or ischemic injury such as umbilical arterial pH, intrapartum stillbirth, newborn Apgar scores and neonatal seizures. This technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with cerebral palsy. EFM as it is presently used in the clinical setting has been associated with an extraordinary increase in the use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery. No functional algorithm has yet been developed that integrates clinical data collected in the antepartum period and during labor and any other patient specific data with the results of EFM. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of EFM data, especially under real world conditions and in real time where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in significantly decreased use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery while more precisely defining the fetus at risk for developing metabolic acidosis and long term neurologic injury. The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) of the fetal heart rate (FHR) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to oxygen deficiency, but its weaknesses almost all stem from the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns. The widespread use of this technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with severe hypoxic/ischemic neurological disorders, but it has been associated with an extraordinary increase in cesarean delivery rates. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of FHR monitoring data, especially under real world conditions where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes.

"DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease Project Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous: it has many subtypes and the disease progresses at different rates in different subtypes. Disease progression in early-stage PD is observed as signal changes in SPECT imaging with 123I-FP-CIT, which is called DaTscan imaging, or simply DaTscan. The goal of the research proposed here is to create accurate models of heterogeneous PD progression using DaTscan images. Such models will not only provide additional insight into PD, but they are also critically important in assessing the effect of neuro-protective therapy. A new set of models called mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) are proposed to model early-state PD progression as it manifests in DaTscans. MLDS models combine machine-learning methods with linear dynamical system theory. They capture many features of early-stage PD progression: laterality, non-linear progression, as well as PD heterogeneity. Preliminary results show that, MLDS is accurate, finds progression subtypes, relates well to clinical data (MDS-UPDRS motor scores), and gives genuinely new insights about PD progression. The proposed research aims to develop the MLDS methodology in region-of-interest as well as voxel-based frameworks. A detailed discussion of the MLDS theory, model fitting, and the relation to clinical data is included. Longitudinal DaTscan images as well as MDS-UPDRS motor scores are available for over 440 subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), and this data set will be used along with MLDS to create the PD progression models. Project Narrative How Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses is poorly understood. This research proposes to develop precise disease progression models for PD using machine-learning. These models will give greater insight into PD progression and also help assess PD therapy.",DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease,9698441,R01NS107328,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Glean', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Theory', 'Work', 'base', 'disease heterogeneity', 'dopamine transporter', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'model design', 'neuron loss', 'presynaptic', 'progression marker', 'putamen', 'research clinical testing', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'uptake']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,353562,-0.022768578843672716
"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function. Our proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s plan to support the design and testing of new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight (Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research).",Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake,9796542,R01DK121703,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Comorbidity', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Distal', 'Duodenum', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Emetics', 'Emetine', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Ferrets', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Gastric Bypass', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Gastrointestinal Physiology', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hearing', 'Heart Rate', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Rat', 'Laboratory mice', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Satiation', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Vomiting', 'awake', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gastric fundus', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal function', 'healthy weight', 'heart rate variability', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'side effect', 'therapeutic target', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,488645,-0.003594561885134041
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,9683972,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,735621,-0.0014973929736269013
"Cancer Prevention through Dietary Change: Training in translational neuroimaging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Unhealthy eating increases the risk of developing several kinds of cancer. This occurs directly through consumption of carcinogenic food, and indirectly through overweight and obesity. Because nearly 70% of American adults are overweight or obese, it is critical to develop effective interventions to alter eating behavior. One key factor that influences eating behavior and weight gain is cue-induced food craving. Craving stimulates appetitive motivation to eat, but can be regulated via cognitive strategies such as reappraisal, or the reconstrual of a stimulus to change its affective meaning. Reappraisal increases the salience of consumption- related costs and reduces food craving for unhealthy food. Craving reappraisal is therefore a promising target for interventions designed to reduce unhealthy eating and risk for diet-related cancers. However, individual differences in treatment efficacy remain a persistent problem with interventions. To understand why an intervention works for some individuals and not for others requires clearly defined neurobiological mechanisms of change, as well as sensitive and specific tools to evaluate individual differences in psychological targets. To fill this gap, the goal of this project is to leverage machine learning and multivariate neuroimaging methods to develop and validate a sensitive and specific neural signature of craving reappraisal that can be used as a neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability. To achieve this goal, this project will pursue the following Aims: 1) develop and validate a neural signature of craving reappraisal in an independent sample of existing data, and 2) establish the predictive and incremental validity the neural signature in the context of an ongoing randomized control trial of cognitive reappraisal training to reduce unhealthy eating in overweight and obese adults. Specifically, after development, I will test the construct validity of the neural signature by assessing whether expression of the signature is greater while participants reappraise their desire for craved food than while they simply view these foods (Aim 1). I will also test the predictive and incremental validity of the neural signature by assessing the extent to which individual differences the neural signature change predict intervention outcomes, such as the value of unhealthy food and eating behavior, above and beyond standard methods (Aim 2). Upon completion of this project, I will have developed and validated a sensitive and specific neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability that can be readily used by other researchers to evaluate intervention efficacy and individual differences in responsivity to treatment. I will also receive in-depth training in translational neuroscience interventions for cancer control, and multivariate neuroimaging and machine learning. This work will facilitate the refinement of reappraisal-based interventions to reduce unhealthy eating that will ultimately reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity and risk for diet-related cancers. Further, by documenting my analysis process and sharing my analysis code, the results of this work can readily be adopted by others to study a variety of psychological processes relevant to eating behavior and cancer risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive reappraisal can be used to reduce food craving and unhealthy eating (a key risk factor for several kinds of cancer), but interventions to train reappraisal ability are not equally effective for all individuals. This project aims to leverage multivariate neuroimaging and machine learning techniques to develop an objective, neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability that can be used to assess individual differences in treatment responsivity. The knowledge and research training gained from this project will prepare the trainee to build and refine interventions to reduce unhealthy eating that will ultimately reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity, and risk for diet-related cancers.",Cancer Prevention through Dietary Change: Training in translational neuroimaging,9756118,F31CA232357,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'adult obesity', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenicity', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'control trial', 'cost', 'craving', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'food craving', 'increased appetite', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'open source', 'parent grant', 'post intervention', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2019,39535,-0.01144617710909371
"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief. These findings may advance understanding of the process of grief, facilitate early identification of high-risk grievers and potentially form the basis for targeted treatment of complicated grief.",Predicting complicated grief from grief processing,9686793,K23MH114021,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Down-Regulation', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Guilt', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Reaction Time', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Stimulus', 'Suicide', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Trauma', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intense pain', 'loved ones', 'neural patterning', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'sustained attention', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K23,2019,199800,-0.019237528082636932
"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics.

"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes Project Summary Motor vehicle crashes lead causes of adolescent mortality, making this a major health threat facing US adolescents. Given that 95.6% of novice driver crashes are due to driver error, improved skill should reduce crash incidence. Research supports this: novice driver crash rates peak immediately following licensure and decline steeply with experience gained over the months following licensure. However, it is not known which critical driving skill deficits present at licensure predict crashes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop interventions prior to licensure that can lead to the safest independent driving post licensure. With this R21 project, we will identify deficits in driving skills that are (a) associated with major predictors of early crash risk (age at licensure and sex) and that (b) can predict differences in crash rates within the first year of independent licensure. We will leverage our exclusive access to an innovative, newly available data source for young driver research. To enable study of safety critical driving skill deficits in novice drivers, results from a new (as of July 2017) virtual driving test (VDT) - developed by the PI, adopted by the State of Ohio and delivered immediately prior to the on-road licensing examination - will be linked to Ohio licensing and crash data. We propose these aims: Aim 1: identify skill clusters using multivariate clustering, regression and machine learning techniques to test the hypothesis that these clusters are related to age at licensure, sex, and time spent in the learner period; Aim 2a: use data on driving skills linked with reported crash data in Ohio to determine whether the skill clusters identified in Aim 1 are associated with crash risk; and Aim 2b: determine if those skill clusters from Aim1 are predictive of crashes in rural teen drivers. With a large sample of new driver applicants (>25,000), this study will examine, for the first time, differences in skill, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will create a normative dataset of novice driver skills; classify skill deficits by age, sex and time in learner period; and quantify the relationship between skill deficits and crash rates during the first 2 months of licensure (when crash rates are highest for young drivers) and the following 10 months as experience accumulates. If the use of the VDT proves successful in predicting crash risk, we will be able to identify novice drivers with elevated crash risk before granting a license. This R21 will enable the following lines of research: (1) Develop new interventions that address skill deficits through training, individualized to the needs of the novice driver (in partnership with Ohio). (2) Develop or adapt advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or self-driving vehicle technology to mitigate identified skill deficits (as part of Dr. Winston’s National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center). (3) Conduct a prospective study (R01) of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk. Narrative We will identify safety-critical driving skill deficits immediately prior to licensure that predict crashes, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will leverage exclusive access to newly available data on >25,000 novice drivers: state licensing and crash data linked to results from a new (as of July 2017), well-validated virtual driving test that identifies driving skill deficits (adopted by Ohio). If this R21 finds the VDT successful in predicting crash risk, we plan to: (1) conduct a future study of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk and (2) develop new interventions (training and vehicle technology) to address this risk.","Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes",9808966,R21HD099635,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industry', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Licensure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Police', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vehicle crash', 'Young driver', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'design', 'driving skills', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prospective', 'safety study', 'sex', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suburb', 'virtual']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2019,294653,-0.011774970135345595
"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",9661385,R01CA227122,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Breast', 'Cause of Death', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leisures', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Longevity', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'adjudicate', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sex', 'vigorous intensity', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,200000,-0.04384208585406599
"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,9703882,R01AI135115,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladeshi', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholera', 'Cholera Vaccine', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Haiti', 'Haitian', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sanitation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Standardization', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Vibrio cholerae O1', 'Vibrio cholerae infection', 'Water', 'age related', 'base', 'cohort', 'diarrheal disease', 'disorder risk', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,687902,-0.012318087064427309
"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,9724645,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2019,190538,-0.01793541589917295
"Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary/Abstract At least 40% of children will experience a traumatic event. Of those who experience a trauma, 15-40% will develop Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and other adverse psychiatric, health, and functional outcomes (herein called Child Traumatic Stress - CTS). Despite decades of research on risk factors for CTS, the field has not arrived at specific risk factor models that can accurately predict the likelihood of CTS outcomes or identify factors that – if changed – would change their likelihood. Knowledge about changes in factors that result in changes in outcomes is, by definition, causal. The vast majority of findings in the literature on risk for CTS cannot provide such causal knowledge because such findings were based on the application of correlational methods to observational data. Experimental research cannot – for all practical purposes - be conducted for human research on risk for CTS. Thus, the field is left with correlational observational research as the near exclusive generator of empirical knowledge on risk for CTS, and such knowledge is unsuitable to guide the actions (i.e. interventions) that must be taken to change children's likelihood of acquiring CTS outcomes. We propose to address this considerable barrier to progress by applying methods that can enable confident causal inference with large observational data sets containing a broad diversity of risk variables for CTS. Machine Learning (ML) predictive and causal modeling methods will be applied to discover causal relationships among measured variables from observational data: and from such determined causal relationships, to estimate the effect on a CTS outcome when a causal variable is manipulated (i.e. intervention simulation). We will build models for outcomes associated with childhood trauma in the literature and that entail significant burden to children's well-being, functioning, and development: PTSD, Depression, Substance Abuse, Health, and Educational Performance. Project Narrative This application proposes research to apply an array of powerful and innovative computational methods – well validated in other fields – to advance the capacity to predict and prevent traumatic stress in children and adolescents. These methods will be applied to several highly relevant, existing data sets that cover diverse populations of traumatized youth and with diverse data collection designs. The data sets and the analytic methodologies have been carefully selected to advance knowledge related to prediction, discovery of causal mechanisms, and the identification of promising preventative interventions for child traumatic stress.",Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1,9885086,R01MH119114,"['18 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Child Welfare', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Stress', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Youth', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'social', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'traumatized children']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,781926,-0.02859500308182848
"Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality Project Summary/Abstract  While exposure to high ambient temperature (i.e., heat) has long been recognized as a threat to public health, the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat- related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecasted extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and government officials. However, it is largely unknown: (1) what are the optimal metrics of heat stress to inform when to issue heat alerts, (2) how effective are heat alerts in protecting the public’s health and (3) what factors make heat alerts comparatively more or less effective in some places or in some people versus others. In the absence of such information, we will fail to maximize the public health benefits of heat alerts.  The goals of this proposal are to identify the optimal health-based and location-specific metrics for issuing heat alerts, to estimate the causal benefits of heat alerts, and to identify characteristics of individuals or communities associated with the greatest reductions in morbidity or mortality following heat alerts. Specifically, using national claims data on deaths and hospital admissions among the large, geographically diverse population of >60 million US Medicare beneficiaries age ≥65 years enrolled between 2001 and 2015, and on emergency department visits among >130 million participants of all ages from one of the nation’s largest health insurers, we propose to: (Aim 1) Use novel machine learning methods to identify the heat metric(s) (e.g., heat index, ambient temperature, spatial synoptic classification, wet bulb globe temperature, absolute humidity) that best predict excess heat-related deaths, emergency hospitalizations, and emergency departments visits in each location, (Aim 2) estimate the causal effects of NWS heat alerts on rates of mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits across the country and within groups stratified by health outcome, sex, and age group, and (Aim 3) assess how the benefits of heat alerts vary across characteristics of communities.  Key innovations of this proposal include a very large sample size, geographic diversity encompassing the entire US, the assessment across multiple health endpoints and age groups, and the use of sophisticated methods in statistical learning and causal inference. Collectively, the findings from this proposal will provide meteorologists, public health and emergency management officials, and local policy-makers with critical information to better protect public health during extreme heat events and guide more targeted future research on strategies to mitigate the adverse health effects of heat. Project Narrative Extreme heat is recognized as an important threat to public health, and the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat-related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecast extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and local government officials, although it remains largely unknown whether such alerts are effective in protecting people. We propose to provide forecasters and public health officials across the country with location-specific, health-based evidence as to the effectiveness of heat alerts and insights into how to improve them to better protect the public’s health.",Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality,9638880,R01ES029950,"['Age', 'Air Conditioning', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Government Officials', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Hospitalization', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Local Government', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'United States', 'Weather', 'age group', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'burden of illness', 'comparative', 'evidence base', 'extreme heat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health emergency', 'response', 'sex']",NIEHS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,662969,-0.003816624910478841
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,9658873,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,317858,-0.005305382398479351
"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development,9681837,F31ES030263,"['Address', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flame Retardants', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenols', 'Placenta', 'Plastics', 'Policy Maker', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'consumer product', 'data management', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fundamental research', 'health of the mother', 'high dimensionality', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'pollutant', 'polybrominated diphenyl ether', 'prenatal exposure', 'public health intervention', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2019,31591,-0.008874039746769327
"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality. Rates of depression begin to rise rapidly in early-mid adolescence and peak in early adulthood. This project seeks to identify early antecedents and risk factors for the onset of depressive disorders and to understand the processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically signficant psychopathology.

"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9903905,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Appalachia', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'sociodemographics', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2019,418818,-0.01409187974680741
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control. The proposed project relies on synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to test two such JITAIs driven by the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), a device that automatically detects and characterize eating behavior in real-time. The information provided by the AIM will be used to implement and test personalized, adaptable behavioral interventions aimed at the reduction of energy intake.",Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior,9818246,R01DK122473,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Eating Disorders', 'Elderly', 'Energy Intake', 'Feedback', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthy Eating', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mastication', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'healthy weight', 'increased appetite', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'nutrition', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'success', 'sucking', 'synergism', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'weight maintenance']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2019,663683,-0.01018979139474103
"A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets Abstract A considerable proportion of outdoor physical activity is done on sidewalk/streets. For example, we found that ~70% of adults who walked during the previous week used the sidewalks/streets around their homes. Interventions conducted at geographical levels (e.g., community) and studies examining relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., traffic) and walking/biking, necessitate a reliable measure of physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The Block Walk Method (BWM) is one of the more common approaches available for this purpose. Although it utilizes reliable observation techniques and displays criterion validity, it remains relatively unchanged since its introduction in 2006. It is a non-technical, labor-intensive, first generation method. Advancing the BWM would contribute significantly to our understanding of physical activity behavior. Therefore, the objective of the proposed study is to develop and test a new BWM that utilizes a wearable video device (WVD) and computer video analysis to assess physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The following aims will be completed to accomplish this objective. Aim 1: Improve the BWM by incorporating a WVD into the methodology. The WVD is a pair of eyeglasses with a high definition video camera embedded into the frames. We expect the WVD to be a viable option for improving the acquisition and accuracy of data collected using the BWM. Aim 2: Advance the WVD-enhanced BWM by applying machine learning and recognition software to automatically extract information on physical activities occurring on the sidewalks/streets from the videos. Methods: Trained observers (one wearing and one not wearing the WVD) will walk together at a set pace along predetermined, 1000 ft. sidewalk/street segments representing low, medium, and high walkable areas. During the walks, the non-WVD observer will use the traditional BWM to record the number of individuals standing/sitting, walking, biking, and running along the segments. The WVD observer will only record a video while walking. Later, two investigators will view the videos to determine the numbers of individuals performing physical activities along the segments. For aim 2, the video data will be analyzed automatically using multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the number of humans in a segment as well as the type of physical activities being performed. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees) will be assessed using moderator analyses. We expect the new approach will enhance measurement accuracy while reducing the burden of data collection. In the future, we will expand the capabilities of the WVD-CNNs system to allow for the determination of other characteristics captured by the videos such as caloric expenditure and environmental conditions. Our long-term goal is to substantially improve the assessment of physical activity and our understanding of physical activity behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sidewalks and streets are public spaces where a considerable amount of physical activity occurs. As such, accurate and feasible methods are important for understanding the role these areas play in facilitating physical activity and improving public health. In the proposed study, we will develop and test a state-of-the-art, observation approach using a wearable video device and computer technology to measure physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. Findings have the potential to significantly impact research in this area and inform the further development of technology-enhanced observation methods for widespread, practical applications that promote healthy lifestyles and reduce chronic disease risks across the age spectrum.",A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets,9755242,R21HL143553,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Error Sources', 'Expenditure', 'Eyeglasses', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Social Environment', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Trees', 'Walking', 'advanced system', 'convolutional neural network', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'healthy lifestyle', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'national surveillance', 'novel strategies', 'physical inactivity', 'physical science', 'practical application', 'success', 'technology development', 'walkability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R21,2019,193160,-0.0034233693830264937
"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",9746883,R01HL121226,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dobutamine', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family suidae', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Ischemia', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'feedforward neural network', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'radio frequency', 'spatiotemporal', 'synthetic construct', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,824785,-0.016271158139341005
"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,9813026,R01AG064589,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Calendar', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research Design', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'To specify', 'Venous', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'cohort', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'design', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'population health', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'simulation', 'time use', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'trend analysis']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,531144,-0.020803143686059088
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988.

"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma.

"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,9778822,R01DK114945,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Patterning', 'Body fat', 'Calibration', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population Group', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age group', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'older women', 'performance tests', 'response', 'scale up', 'sedentary', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,660041,-0.04701747759028169
"Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology Project Summary/Abstract The candidate’s long-term goal is to become an independent investigator focused on the neurophysiological pathways that link psychological stress with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individual differences in biological responses to acute psychological stress have been shown to predict risk for subclinical and clinical markers of CVD, indicating that variation in the stress response relates to measurable health outcomes. The proposed research and career development program will position the candidate to definitively address open and mechanistic questions on cardiovascular stress physiology with a multi-dimensional approach. The overall objective of the current project is to identify the ‘brain–cardiovascular’ pathways of metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress. The central hypothesis is that metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress are caused by increased brain activation in areas associated with cardiovascular and autonomic control. In extension, the candidate will test whether altering brain function via neuromodulation will regulate downstream cardiovascular responses. Proposed are two independent studies. In Aim 1, we will newly examine the relationship between metabolically excessive cardiovascular and neural responses using a cross-sectional approach. In Aim 2, we will measure stressor-evoked metabolic and cardiovascular responses before and after neuromodulation in an experimental approach. Participants will engage in a novel, non-invasive neuromodulation technique, transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS), known to alter the brain by increasing oxygenation, and will be compared to an established control. This research plan will help the candidate develop essential skills for career development including cardiovascular and metabolic testing, machine learning and cross-validation methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses, and utilizing a neuromodulation technique, TILS. The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide 5 years of training through a combination of research, classroom experiences, and mentoring to further the candidate in preparation for scientific independence. Specifically, the candidate will gain expertise in measuring metabolic activity, advance her computational neuroimaging analysis skills, become proficient in experimentally manipulating brain function, and develop necessary statistical skills. The project brings together a mentoring team of experts in their respective areas to provide the candidate with the necessary skills to continue on the trajectory to make a transformative contribution to the field of Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine. This project will provide vital information regarding the pathways between psychological stress and CVD risk while at the same time providing training and mentoring for the candidate’s further career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exaggerated physiological responses to psychological stress are commonly regarded as contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD), nonetheless, we lack an understanding of the mechanisms by which psychological responses to threat are translated into cardiovascular responses that are excessive to the immediate physiological needs of the individual. The project will use both cross-sectional and experimental approaches to examine how the brain and cardiovascular system interact during psychological stress and will provide a a more comprehensive understanding of the role the brain plays in metabolically-excessive responses to stress. This research is relevant to public health because it is a crucial step in understanding how psychological stress relates to a risk factor for CVD and is necessary to develop appropriate brain- based approaches to CVD risk prevention and stratification.",Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology,9821766,K01HL145021,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Markers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Limbic System', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic stress', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Professional Competence', 'Program Development', 'Psychological Stress', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'experience', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'stressor', 'time use']",NHLBI,BAYLOR UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,152227,-0.016537955150666712
"Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water PROJECT SUMMARY Detrimental health impacts of lead are largely attributed to long-term exposures to undetected lead, which are particularly troublesome and problematic because of the neurological damage to children, a situation that should not be tolerated by an advanced society like the U.S. The Flint Water Crisis and many other water catastrophes could have been avoided if early warning can be made possible through timely detection of lead in drinking water at the point of use. Our extensive customer interviews unambiguously suggest that current options for lead detection are unsatisfactory for on-site testing, as they represent two extremes: one being accurate but expensive, slow, and hard to use; and the other being low-cost, fast, and easy to use but inaccurate. NanoAffix Science LLC (NAFX) proposes to address the above unmet need and niche market product gap by empowering water users (particularly those in economically disadvantaged communities) and water service providers with a low-cost, easy-to-use, and accurate handheld tester for rapid detection of total lead in the tap water, right from the kitchen sink. The handheld lead tester combines a novel proprietary micro-sized sensor chip embedded in a proprietary test cell with a portable digital meter for direct readout of testing results. The Phase I project has successfully established the feasibility for detection of soluble lead in the tap water using an earlier version of the prototype handheld tester. The Phase II project will continue to develop the handheld tester toward total lead detection, better device uniformity, pilot scale-up manufacturing, and accurate calibration. At the end of the Phase II project, NAFX plans to produce 20 beta units of the handheld lead tester meeting all performance specifications for field validation by 10 initial customers (e.g., schools/daycares, end water users, and well water drillers). Major innovations of the proposed approach include accurate prediction of the particulate lead through partial digestion based on lead digestion kinetics, and strategic and synergistic improvement of the ultimate sensor prediction accuracy by (1) improving the physical sensor device uniformity (both intra-wafer and inter-wafer) through innovative device configuration and rigorous quality control; and (2) improving the calibration accuracy through innovative theoretical equilibrium chemistry modeling and machine learning data analytics. The NAFX handheld lead tester is the first of its kind to (1) offer all three features sought by customers: accurate, cheap, and fast; and (2) to simultaneously report all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead), which thus can not only alert customers to the lead hazard in their drinking water but also enable customers to identify possible causes and most effective solutions to mitigate the lead contamination. Therefore, the project will result in not only considerable economic impact but also immense societal impact. The regular use of NAFX handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NanoAffix Phase II project aims to continue the development of a handheld lead tester for accurate and low- cost onsite detection of total lead in tap water by untrained users, based on the success of the Phase I project. The project will contribute to enhancing the public health by offering an accessible tool for quantitative monitoring of all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead) in tap water. The regular use of NanoAffix handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk.","Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water",9847052,R44ES028656,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Calibration', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Disinfection', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'International', 'Interview', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lead Poisoning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Paper', 'Particulate', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'Wireless Technology', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'drinking water', 'economic impact', 'empowered', 'graphene', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lead concentration', 'lead contamination', 'manufacturing scale-up', 'meetings', 'meter', 'nanosensors', 'novel', 'operation', 'portability', 'prototype', 'rapid detection', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'water quality', 'well water']",NIEHS,"NANOAFFIX SCIENCE, LLC",R44,2019,565059,-0.01301662410352071
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9764378,K99ES028743,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2019,81281,-0.016637539751452407
"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This large-scale study will advance the field by studying these different outcomes at their most basic functional level, and by identifying the biological mechanisms through which these specific types of distress and dysfunction develop.",Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes,9756462,U01MH110925,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Department evaluation', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychophysics', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'biobehavior', 'clinical decision support', 'design', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'molecular marker', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'success', 'tool', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2019,5432897,-0.029619085310614534
"TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS ABSTRACT There is a growing interest in dietary patterns that capture the overall quality of diet as well as its constituent foods and nutrients. Commonly used dietary patterns are a priori diet score/index based on a set of dietary recommendations for a healthy diet (e.g., Mediterranean diet, Healthy Eating Index) or data-driven dietary patterns (e.g., prudent diet, western diet). Numerous studies have shown that those dietary patterns were related to the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. However, none of these dietary patterns incorporates eating behavior such as when we eat (i.e., eating time) and how often we eat (i.e. eating frequency) during a day. Since the amount of foods and nutrients consumed at one eating occasion influences the food consumption at the subsequent eating occasion and overall intake of the day, eating time and frequency are integral parts of dietary patterns. Furthermore, several lines of evidence consistently suggest that eating time and frequency as well as a meal composition play roles in body weight regulation and metabolic health and also regulate circadian rhythms, all of which may lead to metabolic dysfunctions and ultimately chronic diseases. Given a clear need to expand the dietary patterns framework and close a gap in dietary patterns methodological work, we propose to 1) develop a “temporal” dietary patterns based on temporal distribution of eating time and frequency during a day; and 2) evaluate if the identified temporal dietary patterns are associated with i) overall diet quality and nutrient intakes, ii) adiposity (e.g., BMI, waist circumference), and iii) metabolic biomarkers (e.g., insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL-cholesterol, c-reactive protein). To overcome a limitation that a conventional statistical method cannot capture multidimensional aspects of temporal dietary patterns (e.g., 24-dimensional feature vectors, multivariate dietary intake time-series data), we will use a novel approach combining nutrition and systems science—machine learning method. The Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP (IDATA) study that repeatedly collected diet, anthropometry, and blood samples from 1,021 men and women, 50-74 years old will be used. During one year, the IDATA study collected 24-hour recalls with clock time for each eating occasion, every other month (total six 24-hour recalls); measured anthropometry three times (baseline and at month 6 and 12); and collected blood twice, 6-month apart. Successful completion of our proposed study will identify temporal dietary patterns that are related to diet quality and metabolic health and validate the utility of temporal dietary patterns as a new tool for future research on diet-health relations and prevention of chronic diseases. NARRATIVE Eating behaviors and its impact on health are complex and multidimensional. The proposed study provides an excellent opportunity to develop new dietary patterns that capture eating behaviors such as when we eat and how often we eat during a day. The findings of the study about healthy eating patterns will also improve dietary recommendations by adding messages on when and how often to eat during a day.",TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS,9659103,R01CA226937,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anthropometry', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calories', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Evaluation', 'Fasting', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Intake', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Macronutrients Nutrition', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'dietary guidelines', 'doubly-labeled water', 'epidemiology study', 'food consumption', 'good diet', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'prudent diet', 'tool', 'vector', 'waist circumference', 'western diet']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,347716,0.0013372491543946303
"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9644557,R01MH059929,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Exposure to', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'clinical imaging', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'information processing', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'pre-clinical', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'symptomatology', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,638179,-0.008834772455466159
"Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury Abstract  My career and research interests have centered on the science of movement and factors that maximize mobility. Whether this is through injury prevention, assistive technology, or biomechanical optimization, it is critical to clinical practice that these processes be well understood so that we can provide the most informed patient treatments. In order to carry out more effective clinically-based studies that inform patient care, it is my desire to continue my training through practical experiences with both formal coursework and a oversight by a strong mentoring team in the following domains: (1) activity-based data collection and analysis and (2) use of advanced statistical methods to investigate multiple factors. Through the K23, I will also gain experience specifically focused on my transition to independence; this will include grantsmanship and lab management, leading the design and implementation of clinical and translational studies, management of personnel and meetings, and pursuit of tenure and an R01. This continued training will be completed in the context of a research study that characterizes activity patterns in functional mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI).  Aim 1 of this study is to predict mobility at discharge and at 1-year post-discharge, based upon patient characteristics and activity during IPR. Mobility outcomes can be challenging to predict, particularly for individuals with moderate strength and sensory impairments. Selecting appropriate training is increasingly important with shrinking lengths of stay and there are potential opportunity costs and adverse consequences on quality of life and participation for individuals who do not receive appropriate interventions. Additional activity measures that we can collect early in the IPR stay, by utilizing low-cost sensors, have the potential to provide rich data sets that we can examine to garner insight into outcomes with little administrative burden. Using a machine learning approach, we will investigate patient characteristics and activity-monitoring data to improve predictive models of patient mobility based on data acquired early in the rehab stay. Achieving these aims will improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI to appropriately target expectations and interventions to maximize functional outcomes.  Aim 2 of this proposal is to quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes (i.e., wheeling walking or changes in activity within mode) in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation. There are factors following discharge that challenge or enhance the sustainability of walking for functional mobility including energy costs, neurologic recovery and biopsychosocial factors such as resilience, self-efficacy, environment, and caregiver support. The association between these factors and post-discharge changes in mobility are not well understood. Using wearable sensors we will quantify time spent walking and wheeling to identify transitions between walking and wheeling, identify factors that contribute to these transitions and investigate their impact on participation. Project Narrative In the context of steadily decreasing lengths of stay for inpatient rehabilitation, and in conjunction with therapy caps in outpatient therapy settings that have led to an overall decrease in patient time spent within a clinical context, it is becoming ever more critical that rehabilitation interventions appropriately target functional mobility (walking or wheeling). Unfortunately, the needed data on how mobility changes following discharge and those factors that most accurately predict patient outcomes is lacking. This proposal seeks to improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI so that expectations and interventions can be appropriately targeted to maximize functional outcomes through the following aims: (1) predict mobility at 1 year post-discharge based on patient characteristics, biopyschosocial factors, and activity during inpatient rehabilitation and (2) quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation.",Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury,9821055,K23HD096134,"['Address', 'Biomechanics', 'Caregiver support', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Coin', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exertion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinesiology', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personnel Management', 'Physical activity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Secondary to', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'community setting', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'gait rehabilitation', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'injury prevention', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'muscle strength', 'neurological recovery', 'opportunity cost', 'patient mobility', 'person centered', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'research study', 'resilience', 'sensor', 'translational study', 'wearable device']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,136420,-0.002950855094337813
"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches",9661259,R01HL141823,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronary heart disease', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Decision Analysis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Policy', 'Hepatocyte', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Low Prevalence', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proxy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic evaluation', 'economic value', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'pediatric patients', 'population based', 'population health', 'premature', 'premature atherosclerosis', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,894544,-0.030023164901215496
"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",9806002,K08MH120341,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Partnership Practice', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Services', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'chatbot', 'computer program', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health service use', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'service delivery', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'success', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web site']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2019,179096,-0.03070063679283706
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9701190,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2019,139614,0.0061643922574316475
"Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis Dr. Hwanhee Hong is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development. Dr. Hong will also use all available resources from other Departments including biostatistics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. This environment maximizes the potential for Dr. Hong to obtain the necessary training and perform the research to establish herself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program. This project will help mental health researchers generalize, apply, and implement findings from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials to target populations. Traditional meta-analyses enable us to borrow strength across multiple studies to gain more power, resulting in reliable and precise effect estimates; however they do not consider how well the trials represent target populations of interest.

"Neural Correlates of Familial and Non-familial ADHD SUMMARY Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent and heritable neurodevelopmental disorder. Neuroimaging studies have found that ADHD is associated with decreased volume of cortical and subcortical structures, delayed posterior to anterior cortical maturation, and dysfunction of fronto-striatal and thalamo- cortical networks. However, findings from these existing studies are highly inconsistent in terms of the structural and functional abnormality patterns. Beyond possible demographic and developmental factors, etiological heterogeneity of the disorder can be a significant component that contributes to the inconsistence of these findings. Among the complicated biological and environmental elements, familial heredity is the most significant factor for the emergence of ADHD. Relative to that in non-familial ADHD (ADHD-n), familial ADHD (ADHD-f) showed more severe executive dysfunction and much higher rate for persisting ADHD symptoms into adulthood. These findings suggest that ADHD-f may represent a biologically more homogeneous subgroup. However, neural substrates of familial vs. non-familial ADHD have not yet been well investigated. By utilizing advanced neuroimaging and analytic techniques, this research will assess the [parental history- related] familial risk influences on functional and structural brain organizations in children with ADHD. Two groups of ADHD (ADHD-f and ADHD-n)) and group-matched control children (TDC) will be involved. Based on extensive findings from existing neuroimaging and clinical studies conducted in our group and other groups, our general hypothesis is that compared to the TDC, both ADHD groups will show significant functional and structural alterations in frontal lobe and thalamus; while relative to ADHD-n, the ADHD-f group will show more severe functional and structural aberrance in frontal lobe and related circuitry. Our ultimate goal is to translate hypothesis-driven neurobiological correlates of the risk factors into clinically applicable biomarkers for guiding individualized interventions in ADHD. The findings of this research represent an important first step in the development of novel and refined intervention strategies for biologically homogeneous subgroups of ADHD. [This project will significantly enhance the research infrastructure and student education at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), by providing biomedical and behavioral science-related training and research experiences to undergraduate and graduate students, especially underrepresented minorities and females. This would allow them to acquire a broad spectrum of fundamental and advanced knowledge and skills in all clinical and technical aspects involved in human subject clinical and neuroimaging research, and develop a vast network of collaborations through the active biomedical and clinical scientists involved in this project. This AREA project thus has significant positive impact on academics and research at NJIT.] NARRATIVE Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent in the general population, with significant cognitive impairments that can exist throughout the lifespan. This project aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms of ADHD with vs. without positive [parental] history.

"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,9685220,K01HL141637,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perceived quality of life', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Professional Organizations', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health data', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'patient expectation', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'skills', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'working group']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,166704,-0.005357044378153627
"MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (COD) are common in the United States and providers have been challenged to provide effective treatments. As a consequence, their clients with COD may experience poor treatment engagement, symptom exacerbation and cycle in and out of emergency services. This is particularly true for underrepresented populations with a COD including individuals whom are homeless and involved in the criminally justice system. Research shows that integrated and coordinated community- based services for COD can improve client outcomes. However, healthcare workforce has a gap in training staff on such treatment techniques, which we aim to close via this Phase II STTR project.  Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is a unique evidence-based, trans-disciplinary treatment designed to address the complex needs of individuals with CODs and includes manuals for high risk populations of civilian and veteran homeless individuals as well as those involved in the criminally justice system. Listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration-Registry for Evidence Based Practices (NREPP), MISSION has had substantial impact. The Veterans Health Administration has deployed it in their national plan to end Veteran Homelessness. Massachusetts has used it in its Statewide Plan to End Homelessness and written it into Public Law for delivery alongside Veterans Treatment courts. While MISSION is a manualized treatment, a recent multisite implementation study identified the need for more comprehensive training tools. With NIAAA support, the University of Massachusetts Medical School (MISSION developers) partnered with Praxis on a Phase I STTR to (1) develop the MISSION University online training platform, (2) show proof of concept by implementing two training modules and an e-simulation case study, and (3) conduct a pilot randomized trial which demonstrated that training-as-usual Distance Learning (DL) + Technical Assistance (TA) outperformed TA alone.  In Phase II, we will complete MISSION U by developing and testing five new MISSION modules and companion e-simulations tools that test knowledge acquisition and application. We will first do a formative evaluation with 20 learners who will provide feedback on MISSION U modules. This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial similar to Phase I in which 60 learners will be randomized to the DL or the DL+TA conditions. In preparation for future scalability, we will uniquely conduct a qualitative process evaluation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework with 42 MISSION U participants to look at facilitators and barriers to implementation. Lastly, we will pilot test machine learning techniques with our 60 individuals who participated in the randomized trial in an effort to help personalize the MISSION U training experience for commercialization. !1 “MISSION U: A Multimedia Training Tool for Treatment of Individuals with Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders” is aimed at training providers of services for these individuals. MISSION U challenges prevailing provider training methodology that relies mainly on on-site provider training and/or online training using typical classroom-type materials. This project not only addresses the growing need for new provider training methodologies, but also offers the promise of improving clinical efficacy and reducing training costs and medical expenditures overall.! !",MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS,9774983,R42AA026751,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Assertiveness', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Community Outreach', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distance Learning', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency medical service', 'England', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based program', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laws', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Multimedia', 'National Health Services', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pre-Post Tests', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Videoconferences', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical efficacy', 'commercialization', 'community based service', 'computer science', 'cost', 'court', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'field study', 'formative assessment', 'health administration', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'outreach', 'peer', 'peer support', 'phase I trial', 'programs', 'prototype', 'provider networks', 'randomized trial', 'satisfaction', 'service providers', 'simulation', 'skills', 'sobriety', 'suicidal risk', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIAAA,"PRAXIS, INC.",R42,2019,751223,-0.016064322960236067
"Using Wearable and Mobile Data to Diagnose and Monitor Movement Disorders The long-term goal of the proposed work is to develop a tool to help diagnose and monitor movement disorders. Due to increasing and aging world population, more people are living with these disorders. As there is already a shortage of neurologists, and more specifically, movement disorder specialists that have the training to adequately diagnose and manage these disorders, there is a large number of patients that are not receiving optimal treatment. We propose to use a smartphone-based platform to assess the severity of symptoms that are common across different movement disorders in order to achieve our long-term goal. To that end, the current study proposes to tackle 4 specific aims. The first aim will be to develop a mobile application to quantify common symptoms of movement disorders. We will develop a new mobile application that will enable the quantification of symptom severity; namely rest tremor, postural tremor, intention tremor, kinetic tremor, upper-limb coordination, bradykinesia, balance, gait, and cognitive impairments. The data collected from the smartphone-embedded sensors will be transmitted to a secure server where data can be visualized and analyzed. The second aim will be to collect data using the mobile application from healthy individuals as well as individuals with different movement disorders. We will collect data from 30 healthy controls, 30 individuals with Essential tremor (ET), 30 individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), 30 individuals with Huntington's disease (HD), 30 individuals with primary focal dystonia (PFD) of the upper-limb, 30 individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA, and 30 individuals with functional movement disorder (FMD). This dataset will enable us to develop algorithms (Aim 3) that will be used to assess symptom severity and differentiate the movement disorders according to the smartphone data. The third aim will be to develop algorithms to estimate symptom severity and distinguish the different movement disorders from one another. Using the data from the smartphone-embedded sensors, we will utilize machine learning approaches to estimate symptom severity (i.e. tremor, bradykinesia, gait impairment, etc.). Then, based on the symptom severity estimation as well as from features extracted from the sensor data, we will classify the subjects in groups according to their clinical diagnosis. This will enable us to differentiate the selected movement disorders. Finally, the fourth aim will be to assess the usability of the smartphone platform for long-term monitoring of patients. Subjects of patients recruited for Aim 2 will be asked to use the smartphone application at home for 8 weeks in order to determine compliance with its use and its stability over time. This study will provide a novel tool to assess motor and non-motor symptoms that could be used in other areas of research. It will provide a large database of movement, cognitive, demographic, and medical history data of individuals with different movement disorders. Most importantly, it will help in the differentiation and monitoring of movement disorders to improve the clinical management of individuals with these disorders. The prevalence of movement disorders is on the rise due to the expanding and aging world population while there is a lack of trained specialists in, and especially outside, of developed urban centers to adequately diagnose and manage those individuals. We propose that the ubiquity of smartphones could be leveraged to help non- specialists in the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of movement disorders that often exhibit overlapping symptoms such as Essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, primary focal dystonia, spinocerebllar ataxia, and functional movement disorders. We will develop a smartphone application that will collect data during different tasks to help differentiate these disorders and monitor them over time.",Using Wearable and Mobile Data to Diagnose and Monitor Movement Disorders,9655625,R15NS109741,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Bradykinesia', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dystonia', 'Economics', 'Equilibrium', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exhibits', 'Eye Movements', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Gait', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention Tremor', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical History', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Dystonias', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Rest Tremor', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Spinocerebellar Ataxias', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'common symptom', 'equilibration disorder', 'functional disability', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'motor symptom', 'non-motor symptom', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'progressive neurodegeneration', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NINDS,RBHS-SCHOOL/ HEALTH RELATED PROFESSIONS,R15,2019,399532,-0.01048332782495862
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9751223,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental arm', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'weight loss program', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2019,571889,-0.017066100011731485
"LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sober Grid™ has developed a smartphone-based mobile application currently in use by over 120,000 individuals worldwide who are in, or seeking, recovery from drug and alcohol addiction. The “Grid”, as it is known, is a mobile-based, social recovery community providing rapid context- specific peer support, efficient help seeking, motivational enhancement exercises, and member ratings of support content – all aimed to prevent relapse. The overarching goal of this phase II project is to extend the current capabilities of the Sober Grid app to achieve a comprehensive social recovery support app featuring intelligent, context appropriate resource matching and 24/7 rapid response peer-coaching that is effective in reducing disordered substance use and is cost effective. We hypothesize that providing this functionality to high-risk members will be acceptable, feasible, increase access to and engagement with resources, and have a positive effect in increasing time to relapse and days of consecutive abstinence. The company’s priority commercial goal is to leverage the insights gained from its large database of information and behaviors recorded in its existing addiction recovery-focused social network, combined with its recently completed SBIR phase I work, to identify users at risk for relapse and deliver tailored lay and professional peer support, telehealth, and provider interventions prompted by near real-time automated risk indicators built into an Enhanced Sober Grid (ESG) solution. The specific goals of this proposed phase II project include: (1) implementing the relapse risk scoring algorithm successfully developed in phase I in a production environment, (2) developing a ML resource relevancy matching algorithm, and (3) using this system to pilot test the feasibility and acceptability as well as to estimate the effect on abstinence of providing peer-coaching and resource information to a national sample of Sober Grid members in recovery from non- alcohol/nicotine substances who are predicted to be at high risk for relapse. We will accomplish our objectives by: (Aim 1) Implementing an accurate, near real-time production risk prediction system; (Aim 2) Developing an enhanced, in-app substance-addiction recovery resource locator; and, (Aim 3) Determining the feasibility, acceptability and estimating the effect size of the proposed ESG among high relapse-risk participants in recovery from opioid, stimulant, or cannabis use. The expected impact of this project is to substantially enhance Sober Grid's ability to deliver effective and timely interventions to the right individuals, at the right time – including those high-need and underserved populations that would otherwise lack access to care and draw considerable resources from the healthcare system. This capability holds the promise to reduce drug and alcohol relapse and the associated negative health impacts at both an individual and societal level while reducing the total cost of providing treatment services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sober Grid is combining near real-time risk prediction with automated phone-app messaging, peer-coaching, and resource visibility and transparency in order to dramatically improve support for recovery from substance abuse. The strategy is to provide continuously available responsive connection and support with simple and familiar ways to search, filter, sort, identify, and review/rate resource options in order to lower overall relapse rates within the population, enabling Sober Grid users to achieve improved health outcomes and institutional payers to reduce the total cost of achieving those outcomes. Over time, the innovations resulting from this project will significantly reduce costs for individuals, public and private payers, the healthcare system, and society at large.",LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION,9681118,R44DA044062,"['Abstinence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug usage', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Traits', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Published Comment', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Stream', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Underserved Population', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'alcohol relapse', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'drug relapse', 'effective therapy', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'marijuana use', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'member', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'phase 2 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'provider intervention', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sobriety', 'social', 'social media', 'stimulant use', 'success', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2019,499907,-0.03818833593847098
"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life.

"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation.

"Phase II - HazPrep Worker Training - Community Risk Profile PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A worker's personal hazard profile (PHP) is a function of hazards present and his/her exposure level to those hazards. Workers with an elevated level of risk are those who can be engaged in activities related to - or working around - hazardous materials, waste generation, removal, containment, transportation, and emergency response. inXsol’s Phase I feasibility study verified appeal and effectiveness of a new form of crowdsourced social learning platform. Our approach using cloud technology creates a dynamically growing library of incidents/scenarios, highly personalized (occupation/task/geo) risk profile and generates learning activities to train on risk awareness and mitigation techniques. The Phase II proposal includes implementation of an innovative use of big data algorithms for community profiles and fusion with PHP allowing for targeted and personalized training completing the HazPrep prototype developed and exercised by our beta test team in Phase I. PROJECT NARRATIVE HazPrep is a new form of a social learning platform which includes crowdsourcing and machine learning AI to formulate personalized learning activities at risk workers with an elevated level of risk such as those who can be engaged in activities related to - or working around - hazardous materials, waste generation, removal, containment, transportation, and emergency response.

"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9884859,R00ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'social vulnerability', 'tool']",NIEHS,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,249000,-0.05798738846657969
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,9974957,K99HD096125,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Childbirth', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Ductal Epithelial Cell', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Excretory function', 'Failure', 'Fetal Mortality Statistics', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Nephrons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Organ', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'associated symptom', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'early onset', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney dysfunction', 'maternal serum', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pregnancy disorder', 'premature', 'prevent', 'response', 'stillbirth', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'uptake', 'urinary']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2019,104534,-0.04535874275961073
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8.

We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9920544,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2019,86955,-0.010557571419380575

"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features.

"Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) are at increased risk for numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, substance use, HIV/AIDS, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Despite clear documentation and replication of these health disparities, relatively little is known about their development from adolescence into adulthood. Two theories primarily dominate the literature. Minority stress models describe unique life stressors experienced only by sexual minorities (e.g., victimization and discrimination based on sexual orientation) as primary contributors to health disparities. Other models implicate both minority stress and normative psychosocial processes together as contributors to health disparities. Some such normative processes include (1) psychological adjustment and characteristics (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, substance use expectancies), (2) disrupted social systems (e.g., family, peers, school), and (3) individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, temperament). To date, most studies of both minority stress and normative processes are limited by use of cross-sectional samples of primarily Caucasian adults. Although much has been learned from these studies, they do not permit analysis of emerging health disparities across development. Existing research is therefore limited in terms of both generalizability to diverse populations, and validity of directionality inferences between observed ‘predictors’ and ‘outcomes’. My long-term career goals are to identify mechanisms leading to disparities among sexual minorities, with the goal of improving treatments for these disparities, and to develop screening tools to identify high-risk youth who would benefit from prevention programs. To reach this goal, in this project, I address existing limitations to the literature using a prospective sample of individuals who were 14-19 years old at baseline and followed for over 4 years. My goal is to describe developmental trajectories and mechanisms of health disparity development for sexual minority youth compared with heterosexual youth across a 10-year developmental window spanning ages 14- 23 years. Longitudinal outcomes include depression/anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, sleep, general physical health, disordered eating and substance use. Developmental trajectories for these outcomes will be charted by gender and sexual orientation. Confirmatory analyses based on existing literature will be conducted to examine relations between minority stress and adverse outcomes. Then, I will use machine learning to identify as-yet unknown predictors of adverse outcomes and health disparities and characterize any changes in prediction across time. Finally, I will use state-of-the art intervening variable analyses (mediation, moderation) to evaluate longitudinal mechanisms through which health disparities emerge. Findings should provide insight into mechanisms of disparity development and maintenance, informing prevention and intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) experience wide-ranging disparities in mental and physical health that often persist into adulthood, yet little is known about development of these disparities. This research (1) examines developmental trajectories in mental and physical health outcomes from adolescence to young adulthood among sexual minority and matched heterosexual youth, (2) uses advanced statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to identify hypothesized and currently unknown factors that predict disparities over time, and (3) elucidates pathways to adversity and resilience. Experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual youth and young adults will be compared to uncover possible differences in developmental experiences that lead to health disparities, with possible implications for prevention and intervention among a highly vulnerable population.",Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing,9760277,F31MD014052,"['19 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Asthma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Documentation', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expectancy', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterosexuals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spirituality', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Victimization', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'emerging adult', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'non-heterosexual', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer victimization', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'resilience', 'sexual identity', 'sexual minority', 'sexual risk behavior', 'social', 'stressor', 'substance misuse', 'theories', 'treatment disparity', 'young adult']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,33183,-0.002612342632569532
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9671858,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2019,613264,0.0021632436928388675
"Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the “Alcoa Study” remains the development of increasingly rich models to explain the disparate health and work-capacity trajectories demonstrated in this universally insured, geographically, socially and economically diverse cohort of 200,000+ men and women as they progress from work-life into retirement. Outcomes of focus remain incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to 1) early life social context via Census data; 2) personal and family work experience and income across the life span via IRS and SSA; 3) post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI) and 4) contextual social environment from lifetime residential geocoding. Consequently, we propose in the next cycle to embrace a life course approach to study the social, environmental and behavioral determinants of the outcomes listed above The specific aims of this grant are: Aim 1: Link Alcoa workers to individual census records to examine how early life environment influences later life health outcomes; Aim 2: Assess the impact on health and function of adverse working environment as it accrues during work-life, with an emphasis on ubiquitous physical hazards; Aim 3: Identify antecedents of short-term and long-term disability across working life as candidates for subsequent hypothesis testing; Aim 4: Assess the impact disability benefits have on employee work function and health; Aim 5: Examine how injuries and health shocks affect retirement savings and subsequent health trajectories; Aim 6: To address generalizability across studies and populations, compare the Alcoa population to relevant complementary datasets, administrative and survey. Viewed altogether, continuation of the Alcoa study with the assembled team of investigators provides an unparalleled opportunity to address a host of critical empiric and methodologic issues previously unapproachable. In addition to understanding better which occupational exposures contribute to chronic disease and disability, these data will allow us to control for economic and other contextual factors to an extraordinary degree. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Alcoa research infrastructure—linking quantitative exposure measures to myriad hazards of active workers whose behavior, social environment and health status from pre-employment through retirement to death are fully observed—provides a unique opportunity to extend our work on the outcomes of focus including incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to early life social context, personal and family work experience and income and post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI).","Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce",9724298,R01AG026291,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Disability Insurance', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Occupational Health', 'Outcome', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Price', 'Privatization', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Shock', 'Social Environment', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disability impact', 'experience', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'study population', 'uptake']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,706675,-0.0355640497419798
"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9750800,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2019,118352,-0.010733440330279611
"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,9732337,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Imagery', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Regimen', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'distraction', 'evidence base', 'haptics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'training opportunity', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,318886,-0.012337664829312207
"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because individualized early detection of lifestyles supporting health or linked with disease may be attainable through the development of analytical techniques integrating multiple layers of data. Such strategies could be applied to utilize the increasing information from personal electronic monitoring devices and to detect patterns associated with positive and negative health outcomes.",Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes,9702773,R21CA224764,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic Disease', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Exercise', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data reduction', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'expectation', 'health data', 'healthy lifestyle', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'modifiable behavior', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'prevent', 'speech processing', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'waist circumference']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,156798,0.006349001516087275
"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics.

"Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach Project Summary Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern, yet it is not clear why individuals and populations differ in their protection against influenza infection. The factors underlying protection can act at multiple scales, and thus building a more complete understanding of protection requires an approach that integrates data at the population, individual, and molecular levels. What factors influence population and individual risk of influenza infection? How different are the antibody responses of individuals against influenza and what factors drive those differences? Here, I propose to identify the relative influence of past infection, vaccination, and antigenic evolution on determining both individual and population susceptibility by quantitatively modeling high-resolution epidemiological and immunological data. In particular, I aim to determine the role of past influenza infection in shaping the susceptibility of different age groups, identify the specific targets of the human antibody response against influenza, and infer the relative importance of infection history, vaccination, and epitope immunogenicity on antibody specificity. This work will have a significant impact on our ability to predict future influenza infection and allow us to target interventions toward the most at-risk populations. Success of this project requires training in advanced computational and statistical methods and state-of-the-art immunological techniques by members of the Departments of Ecology & Evolution and Medicine at the University of Chicago. This interdisciplinary and collaborative training environment will provide a strong foundation for gaining more complete understanding of the interactions between influenza and the human immune system. Project Narrative Influenza infection is a significant public health concern resulting in thousands of deaths annually. Here, I propose to systematically identify how exposure history, vaccination, and other factors affect individual susceptibility to influenza infection. These insights will improve our ability to identify populations most at-risk for infection as well as allow us to tailor intervention and prevention efforts to more effectively combat seasonal influenza.",Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach,9760507,F32AI145177,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Avidity', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Binding', 'Birth', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glycoproteins', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neuraminidase', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive measure', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seasons', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface Antigens', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'age group', 'base', 'cohort', 'combat', 'design', 'immunogenicity', 'imprint', 'improved', 'individual response', 'infection risk', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'seasonal influenza', 'success', 'universal influenza vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F32,2019,65304,-0.027500297522619767
"Institutional Research Collaboration between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Centers for Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Project summary This is the 3rd, 5-year collaborative agreement between CDC's Malaria Branch and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). The proposed research strategy follows the objectives outlined in the FOA and involves 4 themes: a) Operational research (OR) related to malaria transmission reduction, b) OR to identify novel or improved interventions for children with severe malarial anaemia and pregnant women, c) Maximising the public health impact by supporting translation of global policies for the control of malaria in pregnancy to country level policies through information exchange (3.1), and d) Strengthening research capacity of the overseas partners in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia by provision of individual level PhD and post-doctoral studentships and group courses (5.1). Malaria transmission reduction OR activities take place under the umbrella of the long-term collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and CDC in Kenya. LSTM will work with CDC to provide technical support to KEMRI to build the information infrastructure needed to track malaria transmission intensity and progress towards malaria control targets, including the rational development of large-scale entomological monitoring systems in situations with declining vector densities, increased outdoor biting and vector resistance to the commonly used insecticides (1.1), support the development of enhanced semi-automated routine surveillance systems with scannable registers, and conduct continuous malaria indicator surveys for real- time monitoring of the case-burden and infection prevalence (4.1). LSTM will support CDC to develop the concept and seek funding for proof-of-principle studies that determine the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of mass-drug administration with antimalarials when combined with indoor residual spraying (2.1). It will support dose finding studies with primaquine and ivermectin that aim to identify adjunct therapies to enhance the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) (2.2), and support the economic evaluation of different interventions and surveillance methods as part of the transmission reduction activities (2.3). Studies in high risk groups includes research to improve adherence to malaria case-management guidelines in pregnancy in western Kenya (1.2) and three large multi-centre trials including one on the prevention of rebound admissions and deaths with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in children with severe anaemia in Kenya (2.4) and two on the control of malaria in pregnancy: STOPMiP-Indonesia (2.6), STOPMIP2 in Kenya and Malawi (2.5) evaluating the safety and efficacy of intermittent preventive therapy with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Project Narrative The aim of the proposed collaboration is to improve the use of existing interventions and to explore new ways to reduce the burden of malaria in high risk groups such as young children and pregnant women. In addition it aims to explore the effect of different combinations of area-wide interventions to reduce malaria transmission and to evaluate surveillance tools that can measure the beneficial impact on populations in terms of health, household level wealth and quality of health service delivery. These are high priority objectives of the partner institutions in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia and align with the objective of CDC's Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria of the Center for Global Health to refine malaria interventions and develop new tools to stay ahead of the curve and ensure its global investments continue to be successful.",Institutional Research Collaboration between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Centers for Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,9787224,U01GH001646,[' '],CGH,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2019,100000,-0.011052813980574262
"Neighborhood Looking Glass: 360 Degree Automated Characterization of the Built Environment for Neighborhood Effects Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal represents a vertical advancement in neighborhood effects research, producing for the first time, national neighborhood indicators of the built environment. Thus far, only local studies have been conducted due to the resource-intensive nature of site visits to conduct assessments of community features and also manual annotations of street images. With the recent advancement of computer vision and the emergence of massive sources of image data, we will leverage our team’s abilities to develop a data collection strategy utilizing geographic information systems to assemble a national collection of Google Street View images of all road intersections and street segments in the United States. We will utilize this data bank, and develop informatics algorithms to produce neighborhood summaries of built environment that have been theoretically and empirically identified to be important for health outcomes. After the creation of Neighborhood Looking Glass, we will conduct investigations into the impact of neighborhood environments on health utilizing medical records from hundreds of thousands of patients and accounting for predisposing characteristics in analyses. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, computer vision, bioinformatics, and computer science—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Develop informatics techniques to produce neighborhood quality indicators; 2) Measure the accuracy of data algorithms and construct an interactive geoportal for neighborhood data visualization and data sharing, 3) Utilize Neighborhood Looking Glass and a large collection of medical records from Intermountain Healthcare to investigate neighborhood influences on the risk of obesity and substance abuse. The epidemic rise in chronic health conditions is recent and as such suggests its cause is social, cultural, and constructed rather than purely biological. Thus, we have the possibility of intervening on the environment to better support health. Recent studies suggest that the current cohort of young adults may face historically high cardiovascular disease risk and chronic disease burden. Our substantive investigation of the impact of neighborhood factors on chronic conditions will contribute further to the understanding of contextual influences on the health of this cohort at the forefront of a chronic disease epidemic. Moreover, the dramatic rise in overdoses, accidental poisonings, and mental health issues contributing to premature mortality warrants further investigation into risk-inducing environmental factors for substance abuse. Neighborhood Looking Glass will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of street image data to capture built environment characteristics. Results can be utilized to inform population-based strategies to reduce health disparities and improve health. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health The epidemic rise in obesity, related chronic diseases, and substance abuse in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. The development of the Neighborhood Looking Glass will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of street image data to capture built environment characteristics with potential impact on health.

"Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders PROJECT SUMMARY Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a leading cause of injury and psychological distress among middle school-aged adolescents, and occurs at higher rates in youth exposed to harsh parenting. Tradi- tional intervention programs that target those at risk for perpetrating aggression due to harsh parenting have had only limited success. This lack of success may be due to the fact that aggression is the product of complex decision-making processes that are influenced by current states of attention, arousal, and affect. A different approach is to prevent aggression before it happens by interceding when nonverbal indices signal a shift in these critical states. An essential first step towards establishing this prevention-based approach is to isolate nonverbal behavior that reliably predicts forthcoming aggression in high-risk adolescents. Eye gaze, pupillary dilation, and facial expressions are strong nonverbal behavioral candidates given that they are well-established indices of attention, arousal, and affective states. The current proposal uses computational modeling to test the predictive link between these nonverbal behaviors elicited during an ecologically valid social rejection paradigm and subsequent expression of peer-based aggression in adolescents (11-14 years; N=80) with high and low exposure to harsh parenting. Results will lay the groundwork for our long-term objective, to develop next gen- eration interventions aimed at preventing aggression the moment its behavioral precursors are detected. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a costly public health problem that is inadequately addressed by existing interventions. The goal of this project is to implement computational modeling to predict aggression in low and high-risk youth using nonverbal behavior elicited during social rejection and aggression- related decision-making. Next generation interventions can then be designed to prevent aggression when these nonverbal indices are detected.",Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders,9755465,R21HD093912,"['14 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Anger', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eyelid structure', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical aggression', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Testing', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aggression prevention', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'boys', 'bullying', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'high risk', 'high-risk adolescents', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'junior high school', 'male', 'next generation', 'novel', 'peer', 'physical model', 'predictive test', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'success', 'virtual']",NICHD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R21,2019,192906,-0.026832418830955666
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9780580,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2019,7702,-0.05501101987414363
"Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population Project Summary This project will enhance and develop the only source of data that provides core information about work, education, income, and migration for the entire U.S. population. This unique resource allows us to observe today's late-life population when they were young. This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years.

"Infrared Eyes(iREyes) Infrared Eyes Abstract Eden Medical, Inc. is pleased to resubmit this Phase 2 SBIR proposal to develop the “Infrared Eyes” (iREyes) imager system, an affordable and powerful mobile health (mHealth) tool for healthcare. The hand-held iREyes system will acquire both thermal and visible spectrum imagery to quantify healing via thermal indexing methodology. The iREyes will offer a user-friendly product with automated categorization. Diabetic foot wounds are common, complex and costly. Foot areas that are likely to ulcerate are associated with increased local skin temperature due to inflammation and enzymatic autolysis of tissue. Inflammation is characterized by the cardinal signs including redness, swelling, and heat. In addition to identifying inflammation associated with healing, the iREyes will also identify hot spots associated with repetitive stress to reduce ulceration and re-ulceration risk for people in diabetic foot remission. The iREyes will directly quantify inflammation pathophysiology implementing a powerful revised two-part strategy: wound healing via regional foot index analysis and ulcer reoccurrence risk through temperature asymmetry threshold analysis. The combined thermal indexing for healing existing wounds and asymmetry predictive analysis represents a significant breakthrough over current practice.

"Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies Project Summary  To address the burden of mental illness, National institute of Mental Health encourages development of computational approaches that provide novel ways to understand relationships among complex, large datasets to further the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of mental diseases. These datasets are multi- dimensional, including clinical assessments, behavioral symptoms, biological measurements such as neu- roimaging and psychophysiological data. The overall objective of this grant is to advance methodology for analyzing such data to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease, to improve the understanding of individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes, and to provide the capac- ity to handle both cross-sectional and longitudinal data.  Our proposal will leverage two civilian trauma cohorts recruited through the Grady Trauma Project and the Grady Emergency Department Study, and an external validation cohort from the Hill Center study with a similar distribution of trauma exposure. We propose to develop statistically principled, computationally efﬁ- cient statistical learning methods for addressing key challenges in analyzing these large datasets. Challenges include multi-type outcomes, high dimensional data with sparse signals and high noise levels, spatial and tem- poral dependence of neuroimaging data, and heterogeneous effects across patient population. The scientiﬁc premise of this computational psychiatry research is that analytical methods integrating information from brain, behavior, and symptoms will provide much-needed data driven platforms for improving diagnosis and prediction of PTSD and other mental disorders.  In this application, we propose: (1) to develop partial generalized tensor regression methods and partial tensor quantile regression methods that can simultaneously achieve accurate prediction of clinical outcomes and efﬁcient feature extraction from high dimensional neuroimaging biomarkers; (2) to develop tensor response quantile regression methods and global inference that can achieve comprehensive and robust understanding of the heterogeneity in high-dimensional neuroimaging phenotypes in terms of environmental factors such as trauma exposure; and (3) to develop and extend methods in Aims 1 and 2 for longitudinal multi-dimensional data that will enable prediction of future post-trauma symptom severity trajectories in terms of neuroimaging biomarkers and robustify the evaluation of the impact of psychophysiological factors on neuroimaging phe- notypes. The proposed methods will be applied to the two Grady studies to address scientiﬁc hypotheses relevant to PTSD research. We will use the Hill Center study as an independent validation cohort to evaluate the reproducibility and generalizability of the ﬁndings. User-friendly software will be developed. The proposed methodology is generally applicable to many other mental health studies with complex multi-dimensional data. Narrative We propose to develop statistical methods for analyzing large-scale and multi-dimensional data in mental health studies to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease and to help understand individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes. The applications of the proposed methods will generate new knowledge to further the understanding of the mechanism and progression of the PTSD that will lead to improved disease management strategies.","Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies",9839143,R01MH118771,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child Sexual Abuse', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'burden of illness', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predict clinical outcome', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'user friendly software', 'vector']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,614061,-0.017272455310674457
"Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic disabling psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction to the exposure to severe psychological stress, including trauma re-experiencing, hypervigilance, and hyperarousal. Our group has conducted seminal work to establish PTSD as a risk factor for coronary heart disease and autonomic dysfunction. A major concern, based on these findings, is that PTSD could increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) through autonomic dysregulation. This has important clinical implications on management of cardiovascular risk in PTSD. Two important metrics that are potentially useful for risk stratification are T-wave alternans (TWA) and Morphological Beat Variability (MVB). We have found in preliminary investigations that TWA may be linked to acute stress and PTSD, but additional study is needed. In this R03 application, we seek to collaborate with Dr. Gari Clifford in Biomedical Informatics to create a custom program that measures TWA and MVB with state-of- the-art signal processing in a recently recruited cohort of male veteran twins with high-resolution ECG data. We will also study for genetic influences with twin modeling and the effects of acute stress with laboratory- based trauma reminder challenges. Our aims are to 1) Examine the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA a) over 24 hours, and b) during trauma recall challenge; 2) Evaluate the potential role for familial and genetic factors by comparing the within-pair difference in MVB and TWA between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD. We hypothesize that MVB and TWA will be higher, on average, during a 24 hour period, and will increase during trauma recall challenge in PTSD subjects compared to those without PTSD. In addition, we hypothesize that the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA will be stronger within DZ pairs than MZ pairs, implying that there is a common genetic pathway linking PTSD and SCD risk. The development of methods to measure these factors, as well as the study of these important mechanisms, will accelerate Dr. Shah’s progress towards research independence, and help to establish him as an expert in the field of mental stress and SCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Posttraumatic stress disorder is a common and debilitating psychiatric condition that is associated with increased heart disease risk. Whether or not this means that it increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia is not known, but important for clinical management. To study this, we aim to examine the risk of PTSD and its symptoms on electrocardiographic markers of sudden cardiac death.",Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study,9723857,R03HL146879,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Arrhythmia', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional Stress', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Tachyarrhythmias', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Veterans', 'Viola', 'Visit', 'War', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'heart disease risk', 'heart rate variability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'male', 'method development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'programs', 'recruit', 'signal processing', 'sudden cardiac death', 'traumatic event', 'vector']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,78000,-0.006600922829440282
"Environmental Modifications in sub-Saharan Africa: Changing Epidemiology, Transmission and Pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria Environmental Modifications in sub-Saharan Africa: Changing Epidemiology, Transmission and Pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria Supplement Application PROGRAM SUMMARY The current Supplement application is developed under an NIH ICEMR award entitled “Environmental Modifications in Sub-Saharan Africa: Changing Epidemiology, Transmission and Pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria” (U19 AI129326). The overarching objective of this Supplement application is to facilitate malaria control and elimination efforts in Kenya and Ethiopia, the two study countries of our ICEMR, by obtaining entomological and socio-behavioral data needed for introducing new vector control tools and by identifying optimal combinations of vector interventions to achieve the maximum impact in reducing malaria burden. The Supplement application has three projects, each with multiple specific objectives. Project 1 will evaluate the impact of spatial repellents on pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors in MalariaSpheres, a contained semi-natural Anopheles ecosystem for studying mosquito behaviors in Kenya and Ethiopia. Project 2 will examine the social behavioral aspect of malaria vector control, especially the gaps between knowledge and mosquito control practice in the community and the underlying mechanisms for such gaps. Project 3 aims to develop an optimal malaria intervention strategy adaptive to local malaria risk, changing vector ecology, and supply chains, using a cluster randomized sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design. The research proposed in the Supplement application leverages the baseline data, infrastructure, and capacity established by the parent ICEMR and extends it to malaria control goal by generating data critically needed for future field trials of new mosquito control products, identifying new approaches to improve community engagement, and developing new strategies to improve the effectiveness of malaria vector control programs. As insecticide resistance is widespread in Africa and the effectiveness of the current first-line malaria vector control tools need to be improved, knowledge gained from this Supplement application will be valuable to malaria control, not only for the two countries studied under this ICEMR but also for other regions in Africa and potentially elsewhere. Project Narrative This Supplement application will determine the impact of new mosquito repellents on insecticide resistant malaria vectors, bridge the gap between community knowledge on malaria and actual practice in the field, and develop new vector control strategies to maximize the cost-effectiveness on malaria incidence reduction. The knowledge and results from this project will greatly facilitate the malaria control and elimination efforts in Kenya and Ethiopia.","Environmental Modifications in sub-Saharan Africa: Changing Epidemiology, Transmission and Pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria",9706616,U19AI129326,"['Address', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Agriculture', 'Anopheles Genus', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Controlled Environment', 'Country', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Entomology', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethiopia', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Humoral Immunities', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'Insecticides', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Irrigation', 'Kenya', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mosquito Control', 'Parasites', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Perception', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Predisposition', 'Primaquine', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Resource Development', 'Risk', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Behavior', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vivax Malaria', 'Water', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'effective intervention', 'environmental change', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'human migration', 'improved', 'knowledge of results', 'malaria transmission', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'randomized trial', 'social', 'social media', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'uptake', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,U19,2019,722400,-0.004199289842524158
"Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary This National Research Service Award (F32) is designed to promote the development of Stephanie Goldstein as an independent, clinical research scientist focused on developing and evaluating strategies for measuring and intervening on health behaviors that capitalize on digital health technology. Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and health benefits for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes and most experience gradual weight regain, thus negating the benefits over time. Lapses (i.e., self- reported eating instances that deviate from the BOT prescribed diet) could explain poor outcomes, but the behavior is understudied because it is difficult to assess in-lab and via self-report. We therefore propose to study lapses using a multimethod approach with the following tools: ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device), a wrist-worn device that automatically detects eating behavior and various eating characteristics (frequency, rate, and duration of eating episodes), and 24-hour dietary recalls. We will recruit participants (n=40) with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor to enroll in a 12-week BOT program and follow them through an additional 12-week period of weight loss maintenance. Participants will complete a biweekly 7-day EMA protocol to self-report on eating behavior, including the occurrence of dietary lapse. Participants will continuously wear the wrist-worn ActiGraph Link to characterize eating behavior. Lastly, participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls via structured interview (split between days with and without lapses) at 6-week intervals to measure the composition of all food and beverages consumed. The proposed study approach is consistent with priorities of NHLBI to optimize clinical research and diagnostic strategies to improve CVD and related risk factors. This project will be conducted in combination with an individualized training program including a curriculum designed to facilitate the acquisition of key skills and experience to move the applicant towards her career goals. This includes didactic and experiential training related to the use of passive sensing technology and related analytic strategies in research, factors that can impede weight maintenance and dietary adherence in BOT, and administration and interpretation of validated nutritional assessment. The applicant will work closely with her primary sponsor, Dr. J. Graham Thomas, her co-sponsors Dr. Rena Wing (renowned expert in weight maintenance), Dr. Adam Hoover (electrical and computer scientist), and Dr. Whitney Evans (nutritional epidemiologist and registered dietician). This mentorship team, in combination with the infrastructure and resources available through the Miriam Hospital Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center and Alpert Brown Medical School, represent the ideal environment to accomplish the applicant's training goals, foster professional development and increase the applicant's autonomy as an independent clinical obesity researcher. Project Narrative The current project is evaluating the utility of a wrist-worn passive sensing device for detecting dietary lapses (i.e., discrete eating instances that deviate from a prescribed diet) and evaluating the behavior's association with weight loss outcomes. Participants, with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor, will wear wrist-worn devices, complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device) on dietary lapses, and provide information on dietary composition via semi-regular 24-hour food recalls throughout the duration of a 12-week behavioral weight loss program and 12-week weight maintenance period. This study aims to 1) identifying characteristics of lapse behavior by measuring passively-sensed timing, duration, frequency, and rate of eating amongst known lapse episodes, 2) test the association between dietary lapse frequency and weight change, and 3) estimate nutrition composition of dietary lapses.",Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9771304,F32HL143954,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Beverages', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary intake', 'Dietetics', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Energy Intake', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Healthy Eating', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Wing', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'dietary adherence', 'digital', 'experience', 'falls', 'food consumption', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity treatment', 'prevent', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'sleep pattern', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment program', 'weight loss program', 'weight maintenance', 'willingness']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,F32,2019,60552,-0.03327374798027443
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9780348,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2019,41136,-0.0031223552953587716
"VIP:Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition for Local-National Trials PROJECT SUMMARY  Chronic diseases and conditions such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems in the United States. A healthy dietary pattern is paramount in disease risk reduction. Since 2010, the dietary pattern approach has been recommended to examine the relation of the totality of diet and health outcomes by U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees; meanwhile longitudinal dietary data have become increasingly available. Yet, methods are underdeveloped for characterizing longitudinal diet-quality variations and even rudimentary for validating diet- quality patterns that describe these dynamic variations, therefore, leading to unclear evidence for assessing diet-health/disease relationships and formulating dietary guidelines. A noticeable gap exists between dietary pattern literature and the fast-growing statistical learning field. We propose to develop an innovative statistical learning tool for diet-quality trajectory pattern-recognition based on rich and highly-comparable longitudinal dietary datasets from randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies (OS) pertaining to a variety of individuals, race/ethnicities, and geographical locations, and spanning up to 30 years, collected across 4 NIH- funded RCTs in Massachusetts, and 2 large-scale multi-site national RCT and OS studies as well as simulated dietary data based on these trials. Our project builds on PI Fang’s NIH-funded behavioral trajectory pattern-recognition tool (Multiple-Imputation based Fuzzy Clustering, MIFuzzy) which processes longitudinal trial data with missing and zero-inflated values, and identifies latent trajectory patterns that characterize patients’ complex engagement and cognitive response variations during multi-component RCTs and better explains the heterogeneity of treatment effects. This project will enhance and expand MIFuzzy to a Visual- Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition tool (VIP), adapted to diet-quality trajectory pattern analyses and chronic disease risk assessment. Our goal is to provide a new multi-view of diet-quality trajectory patterns and associated outcomes from longitudinal studies. Based upon high-quality and comparable RCT and OS longitudinal dietary data from NIDDK-, NHLBI-, and NIMH-funded studies, this VIP project will help grow more valid evidence for developing dietary guidelines and clarify our understanding of diet-disease relationships for a range of patient/individual types, potentially enabling better personalized, adaptive dietary strategies. Developing this evidence-based VIP tool will also contribute to the infrastructure for diet-related studies, advance pattern- recognition methods, help scientific communities and the lay public compare with local and national diet-quality guidelines, and assess dietary health risks. In the long run, this VIP project will contribute to creating a data management platform that support near-real-time pattern analyses and adaptive interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Evaluating diet quality and encouraging healthful dietary change is paramount for preventing, or managing, many chronic conditions and diseases, including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our innovative Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern-recognition (VIP) method will identify clusters of distinct diet-quality patterns in multiple longitudinal dietary datasets from local and national NIH-funded randomized controlled trials and observational studies. This work will help formulate stronger evidence for national dietary guidelines, deepen our understanding of diet quality trajectory patterns, and elucidate relationships between these patterns and chronic diseases for a range of patient/individual types; it can potentially enable personalized, adaptive dietary strategies. Open-access dissemination of our diet quality pattern recognition tool will contribute to the infrastructure of dietary-intervention studies, advance pattern recognition methodology, and help the scientific community and the public to compare individual dietary behaviors with local and national diet-quality patterns and associated health risks.",VIP:Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition for Local-National Trials,9907572,R56DK114514,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Eating', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Reduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'dietary guidelines', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'field study', 'good diet', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'simulation', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DARTMOUTH,R56,2019,452178,-0.010840035805843796
"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors.

"Concussion and Driving Skills in the Young Driver PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research Objectives. This prospective cohort study rigorously examines the neurocognitive impact of concussion on simulated and real-world driving performance among young drivers aged 16-24 years. Importance. Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving. Unlike new “Return to Learn” guidelines, there are no evidence-based “Return to Drive” guidelines for when individuals with concussion may be safe to return to driving. Objectives. Conduct a prospective matched cohort study to explore the risk of concussion in simulated and real-world driving conditions. We propose three specific aims and a fourth exploratory aim:  (i) Examine whether concussion negatively impacts simulated driving performance among young  drivers, relative to a cohort of young drivers without concussion.  (ii) Determine whether simulated driving task performance correlates with recovery from  concussion symptoms and signs in the month following concussion, relative to young drivers  without recent concussion.  (iii) Measure the impact of concussion and recovery on real-world driving exposure and performance.  (iv) [Exploratory] Examine whether concussion symptoms and neuropsychometric impairment are  associated with higher rates of driving citations or reported crashes. Study design. Prospective controlled matched cohort study. Setting/participants. 50 drivers with recent concussion; 50 age/gender matched controls aged 16-25 years. Study protocol. Concussion participants will be recruited within two weeks of concussion. Case and control participants will complete 1) driving risk survey; 2) neuropsychological testing an 3) simulated driving tasks at baseline and 1 month. Commercially available monitoring technology will record risky driving for 3 months Outcome measures. (i) simulated driving risk scores; (ii) real world driving risk scores (rapid braking, rapid acceleration, speeding); (iii) reported citations and crash rates. Impact. This study will have a significant population health impact in elucidating the neurocognitive sequelae of recent concussion on driving. Results will inform return to safe driving among young drivers with concussion. PROJECT NARRATIVE Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving. This prospective matched cohort study explores the cognitive impact of concussion on simulated and real-world driving performance.

"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9729825,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,173441,-0.0014970321830391502
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Environment, Metabolomics, and PD Project Abstract Our PEG study is among the largest Parkinson's disease (PD) population-based study with exceptional high-quality disease characterization and in-depth exposure assessment. Patients are diagnosed and examined (multiple times) by a UCLA movement disorder specialist. We developed a longitudinal geographic information system (GIS) based assessment for pesticide exposures that links state-mandated information on type, date, and location of all agricultural pesticide applications in California recorded since 1974 to land use maps and study participants' residences and work places. Here we propose to combine a powerful new metabolomics tool and system biology analytic methods to identify signatures for toxic exposures that evoke long-term biologic responses. The metabolomics data we will generate will help us identify metabolic profiles for chronic environmental exposures for both PD patients and population controls. This will generate a first understanding of the metabolic consequences of chronic low dose pesticide exposure in PD. However, biologic processes, including biologic responses to chronic toxicant exposures and those involved in disease development, are highly dynamic and interactive systems. The PEG study is uniquely capable to begin investigating these multidimensional networks linking exposure and disease. We have already generated genome and epigenome profiles for 550 PD patients and 250 controls. Here we newly propose to generate and analyze serum based metabolome profiles (targeted and untargeted) for these same 800 study participants characterizing environmental pesticide exposures via metabolome wide association analyses. We aim to develop a metabolite signature of environmental exposure using supervised machine learning methods, and also determine if these are disease specific or found in both exposed cases and controls. Furthermore, incorporating our genome and epigenome information, we propose to use biological systems analysis to identify multi-omics network patterns that distinguish environmental exposures that contribute to PD onset and progression. We expect this to show a chronic response pattern across different molecular layers and are influenced by many environmental factors. Combining multi-omic measures based on multidimensional network and system analyses will address the gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD. Project Narrative Here we propose to build upon a unique resource - the PEG population-based Parkinson's disease (PD) study - to identify metabolic signatures of chronic environmental exposures and disease in 550 PD patients and 250 population controls. Importantly, we plan to integrate exposure and effect markers across multiple molecular layers (genome, epigenome, metabolome), with the goal to obtain a more holistic understanding of molecular changes due to chronic environmental exposures. Our approach incorporates multi-omics measures and multidimensional network and system analyses to address gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD.","Environment, Metabolomics, and PD",9652630,R21ES030175,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anions', 'Archives', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Caffeine', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatography', 'Chronic', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier Transform', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Policy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specialist', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'agricultural pesticide', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biological systems', 'brain health', 'case control', 'cell type', 'disorder control', 'disorder risk', 'environmental pesticide exposure', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'learning strategy', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pesticide exposure', 'population based', 'residence', 'response', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,209000,-0.010400901180008056
"Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform Background. Research has identified a wide range of evidence-based interventions for key behavioral health risks such as poor diet, smoking, unhealthy alcohol use, or a sedentary lifestyle. However, to be truly successful, behavioral intervention science should fulfill at least three key criteria: (1) demonstration of cumulative increases in intervention efficacy; (2) provision of interventions that reach a high proportion of those in need; and (3) demonstration of a meaningful population impact/reduction in disease burden. It currently meets none of these. Some reasons for this include (1) over-reliance on an imprecise delivery mechanism (people; usually therapists or coaches of some kind) that is difficult to train to fidelity on a large scale, and that cannot be manipulated with precision; (2) use of sample sizes that may be far below what is needed to accurately characterize heterogeneity of response; and (3) cross-study variability in therapist characteristics, sample characteristics, and measurement strategy. All of this combines to create a science that lacks evidence of cumulative improvements upon prior benchmarks. Proposed solution. Mobile technology shows significant promise as an intervention delivery mechanism that is replicable, transparent, modular, and precise. However, progress in the development and implementation of mobile interventions has been slowed by factors such as the tremendous time and money needed to develop an intervention; limitations in cross-platform compatibility and interoperability; and lack of a consistent system around which to collaborate. To address these needs, the PI developed the Computerized Intervention Authoring System (CIAS), which facilitates behavioral intervention science by allowing investigators to directly develop sophisticated and interactive mobile applications without programming. CIAS is already being used by investigators outside of the PI’s own lab, a process that has revealed significant interest in this software from a wide range of NIH-funded investigators, as well as significant limitations. Current aims. The proposed application will address these limitations, making CIAS into a significant, open-source, and virtually unique non-commercial research resource. In Aim 1, we will engage in sustained user experience testing designed to make the tool far more intuitive to use. This process is expected to result in a dramatic reorganization of the investigator interface, as well as in a complete set of evidence-based user training and support materials. In Aim 2, we will add a range of features and capabilities to make CIAS more powerful, flexible, and interoperable (e.g., by building to SMART Health IT standards, as well as FHIR open specifications to facilitate integration with Electronic Health Records). In Aim 3, we will engage in focused efforts to promote the use of CIAS as part of multi-lab collaborations using open science practices (e.g., via integration with the Open Science Framework). Importantly, we will engage in all of the above with the assistance of a highly accomplished panel of advisors who will help ensure that the final product is broadly relevant, future-facing, and usable to a broad range of behavioral scientists. Technology-delivered interventions are showing great potential to help people modify unhealthy behaviors like substance use, poor diet, and poor medication adherence. However, designing these interventions is time- consuming and expensive, which is slowing down research in this area as well as the rate at which such technology can help people. This project will take existing research software and significantly enhance it so it can allow scientists to easily and quickly collaborate to develop powerful interventions for mobile devices.","Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform",9882671,U24EB028990,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Apple', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Budgets', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SMART health', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoking', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'alcohol misuse', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brief intervention', 'burden of illness', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'good diet', 'handheld mobile device', 'healthy weight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'open data', 'open source', 'prevent', 'reduced substance use', 'repository', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'software development', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIBIB,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,399297,-0.020511231710865087
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years.

By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9951760,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,366168,-0.023927017851148636
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9697234,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'circadian', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social deficits', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,1273593,-0.04695202770140751
"Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal responds to RFA-MH-17-612, “Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34).” We have shown in several randomized trials that family-focused therapy (FFT) for symptomatic youth at high-risk for bipolar disorder - consisting of psychoeducation and family communication and problem solving skills training - is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in hastening symptomatic recovery. However, between 50%-60% of high-risk youth still have residual mood symptoms and functional impairment after 18 weeks of FFT. In our prior studies, two constructs have emerged as predictors of lack of response to treatment: mood instability in the child and expressed emotion (EE) in parents (i.e., frequent critical comments or hostility). In adolescents (ages 12-18) with a parent with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, we hypothesize that augmenting FFT with frequent and targeted interventions in the home setting through a Smartphone app (MyCoachConnect, or MCC) will (a) have a greater and more rapid impact than standard FFT on the targeted mechanisms of mood instability in adolescents and EE in parents, and (b) as a result, enhance symptom resolution and functioning in adolescents. To be eligible, adolescents must score high on parent-rated measures of mood instability, and have at least one parent who is high-EE by speech sample coding criteria. The MCC app will record weekly open speech samples from parents and children and daily and weekly mood ratings from adolescents. The app assessments will be fed back to the FFT clinician, who will use this information to “push” recommendations for mood regulation, communication, and problem-solving strategies (linked to the FFT modules) for parents and youth. In year 1, we will conduct an open trial (n=25) to determine (a) the feasibility and acceptability of FFT with mobile coaching (FFT-MCC), as given by clinicians in community settings, and (b) associations between online/speech feature proxies of the targets (mood instability and EE as measured weekly by MCC) and standard measures of the targets. In years 2 and 3 we will conduct a 75- case RCT in which families are assigned to FFT with MCC skills coaching, FFT with MCC assessments only, with no coaching; or FFT Only, without MCC. We hypothesize that FFT-MCC will be acceptable to parents, adolescents and clinicians, and more effective than FFT without MCC coaching or FFT-Only in engaging the targets of mood instability and EE and promoting improvements in adolescents' mood symptoms and quality of life over 27 weeks. The study will facilitate the translation of a technological augmentation to an evidence-based family intervention, with the goal of increasing treatment access among families with mood disorders. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a 12-session evidence- based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC “real time” assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills. We hypothesize that the augmented version of FFT (FFT-MCC) will be more effective than FFT without coaching/informational alerts in altering treatment targets and in stabilizing youths' mood symptoms and quality of life.",Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders,9933291,R34MH117200,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Back', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Family', 'Family Relationship', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Hostility', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'community clinic', 'community setting', 'effectiveness trial', 'emerging adult', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'girls', 'high risk', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'mobile application', 'mood regulation', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'psychoeducation', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'skills training', 'smartphone Application', 'standard measure', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy design', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'usability', 'volunteer']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R34,2019,231498,-0.026322155048244165
"ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Gestational diabetes (GDM) rates are on the rise in the US, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. GDM is associated with higher rates of large for gestational age (LGA) infants, C-section, and serious perinatal complications, and increased long-term risks of Type 2 diabetes and morbidity in both mothers and infants. Women who get treatment for GDM are less likely to experience perinatal complications and give birth to LGA infants than those who do not; therefore, rapid detection of GDM may be critical to reducing perinatal complications and disparities in birth outcomes. GDM is normally diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks gestation, but clinically important insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction may be missed by not testing earlier. A metabolically unhealthy uterine environment in early pregnancy may lead to long-term negative impacts on mother and child, but how and when to test for insulin resistance and associated metabolic dysfunction in pregnancy is poorly defined. More data are needed on how glucose levels and other metabolic measures change across pregnancy to better evaluate women's metabolic risks and how those risks relate to perinatal and long-term outcomes. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and metabolic biomarker assays, we will describe detailed metabolic phenotype profiles over the course of pregnancy and examine how they are associated with perinatal and postpartum outcomes. We propose to recruit a diverse sample of 400 women in their first trimester from Kaiser Permanente Northwest and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii and to perform CGM, OGTT, and obtain biomarkers at 12 weeks, 20 weeks, and 28 weeks of gestation to examine how these measures relate to each other and to perinatal outcomes. Aim 1 and Aim 3 will assess the effects of CGM variables (Aim 1) and OGTT and other biomarkers (Aim 3) at each time point on the risk of LGA, other perinatal outcomes, and postpartum diabetes. Aim 2 will assess the relationship between CGM variables and diagnosis of GDM by OGTT, as well as the relationship between CGM variables and other metabolic biomarkers. We hypothesize that dysglycemia is just one marker of a much larger metabolic dysregulation that can be characterized through the work of this consortium. Characterizing a broader spectrum of metabolic dysregulation and its association with adverse perinatal outcomes will lead to improved screening regimens and treatments for pregnant women and better outcomes for both mothers and babies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy that increases the risk of pregnancy and birth complications. New tests may allow doctors to identify women with GDM earlier and more accurately than the tests currently being used, but we need to understand them better. We will recruit 400 pregnant women and screen them using both traditional and new GDM screening tools at 12, 20, and 28 weeks of pregnancy to determine how well these tools identify women who are at risk of complications and need treatment.","ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae",9900630,U01DK123791,"['Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'C-Peptide', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cesarean section', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dystocia', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fasting', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fracture', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'OGTT', 'Oral Diagnosis', 'Organogenesis', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Shoulder', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'Uterus', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomarker identification', 'delivery complications', 'early pregnancy', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fetal', 'glucose monitor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'mortality', 'neonatal death', 'obesogenic', 'offspring', 'perinatal complications', 'perinatal outcomes', 'polypeptide C', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'primary outcome', 'racial minority', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'stillbirth', 'tool']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2019,800511,-0.00046180795183729817

"Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health PROJECT SUMMARY Nearly 10% of Americans practice meditation to improve health. Randomized controlled trials support this practice and show that mindfulness training is effective in improving a broad range of health outcomes. In particular, mindfulness training has been shown to reduce biomarkers of systemic inflammation that contribute to the pathophysiology of disease and predict risk for all-cause mortality. Still, little is known about the biological processes linking mindfulness training with inflammation. This proposal tests the hypothesis that mindfulness training aids the regulation of inflammation by mitigating glucocorticoid resistance (GCR). GCR is a leading candidate mechanism linking psychosocial threat with systemic inflammation. Whereas cortisol released in response to threat normally binds to glucocorticoid receptors and down-regulates inflammation, chronic perceptions of threat lead to a state of GCR, in which glucocorticoid receptors become insensitive to the anti-inflammatory effects of circulating cortisol. Mindfulness training is proposed to diminish perceptions of threat in ways that restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. To test this biological pathway, this study assesses functional GCR and biomarkers of inflammation before and after a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or control Health Enhancement Program (HEP) in a sample of lonely older adults (N=188). Loneliness is a form of chronic psychosocial threat, and is consistently associated with GCR and systemic inflammation, yet MBSR is one of very few interventions successful in reducing loneliness. MBSR is expected to decrease GCR (and restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity) compared to HEP from pre- to post- intervention. Moreover, these decreases in GCR are expected to mediate the effects of MBSR (vs. HEP) on lowering systemic inflammation (CRP and IL-6) from pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up. In sum, this proposal investigates decreased GCR as a biological mechanism through which mindfulness training reduces inflammatory disease risk. It addresses NCCIH's call for research on understanding the biological mechanisms of action underlying mind-body intervention approaches and complements NCCIH's special interest in alleviating inflammatory processes. The knowledge gained from this research will contribute to a better understanding of the basic biological pathways underlying mindfulness practices, which may help to identify and target populations likely to benefit from mindfulness training. The research and training plan described in this application provide opportunities for the applicant to develop a knowledge base and methodology in psychoneuroimmunology, learn statistical techniques for analyzing complex mechanistic pathways, and develop the professional skills necessary for a successful career testing biological and psychological mechanisms underlying mind-body interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mindfulness meditation practices are widely used to alleviate physical symptoms, and growing evidence suggests that mindfulness training may reduce systemic inflammation, but less is known about the biological pathways linking mindfulness training with inflammatory processes. The proposed project investigates a biological mechanism, glucocorticoid sensitivity, to explain how mindfulness training lowers inflammation among lonely older adults who are at risk for multiple inflammatory diseases. From a public health perspective, clarifying this mechanistic pathway will help to identify who is likely to show health benefits from mindfulness training.",Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health,9688917,F32AT009508,"['Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood Circulation', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Dexamethasone', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Feeling', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Immune', 'Immunology procedure', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meditation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Mind-Body Intervention', 'Mindfulness Training', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychoneuroimmunology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy trial', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'falls', 'feasibility trial', 'follow-up', 'health training', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mindfulness meditation', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'physical symptom', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'receptor function', 'receptor sensitivity', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'successful intervention', 'training aid', 'training opportunity']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2019,66110,-0.034991119792995067
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child gut inflammation, growth, and development PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Lin is a research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley in Professor John (Jack) Colford's group. She completed her PhD in Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University in 2012. Since 2010, she has worked as the coordinating microbiologist for the WASH Benefits study, a large-scale, multi- country cluster randomized trial evaluating the impact of water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutritional interventions on child health, with a focus on gut inflammation. This research and training plan builds on her strong interdisciplinary background at the nexus of microbiology, immunology, and global health. Gaining experience in epidemiology and biostatistics will facilitate her transition to a `bench to population' independent investigator at UC Berkeley and will ultimately enable her to achieve her long-term career goal to become a global health leader in the evaluation of antenatal and early life interventions to improve child health. Environment: UC Berkeley has a long history of conducting innovative and groundbreaking research advancing epidemiological and biostatistical theory and application in international health. To achieve her career goal, Dr. Lin seeks training in (1) epidemiology, with a focus on causal inference methods (in particular, marginal structural models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation) (2) biostatistics and (3) child stress and development. To achieve these goals, Dr. Lin has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team based at UC Berkeley. Jack Colford (primary mentor) will guide her training in epidemiological theory and application. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor) will guide her training in biostatistics and causal inference methods including models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Lia Fernald (co-mentor) will guide her training in child development and stress. Research Project: Early life linear growth faltering is associated with impaired development, but its underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood. Subclinical intestinal inflammation and damage affects children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment. In Aim 1, Dr. Lin will determine the association between maternal stress and inflammation during pregnancy and subsequent measures of child gut inflammation and permeability. In Aim 2, she will evaluate the relationship between antenatal stress and inflammation and future child linear growth and development. She proposes to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate the potential pathways from antenatal stress and inflammation to child gut inflammation, linear growth faltering, and poor development. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare Dr. Lin for a successful R01-level application to investigate potential downstream effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child stress, inflammation, and susceptibility to infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Widely pervasive subclinical inflammation and damage of the small intestine is observed in children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and permeability and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment in infants from low-income countries. Understanding these critical pathways will be an important contribution to public health because it will enable the identification of key biological markers to identify prospectively at-risk children, to evaluate the efficacy of interventions, and to suggest potential intervention targets to improve child linear growth and development trajectories; we propose to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate these critical pathways in children living in rural Bangladesh.","A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child gut inflammation, growth, and development",9662744,K01AI136885,"['5 year old', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'C-reactive protein', 'California', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Country', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hygiene', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Mannitol', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neopterin', 'Nutritional', 'Observational Study', 'Orosomucoid', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peroxidases', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Small Intestines', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Villous Atrophy', 'Water', 'Work', 'absorption', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'antenatal', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'cytokine', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'global health', 'improved', 'innovation', 'low income country', 'maternal stress', 'neurodevelopment', 'oral vaccine', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prospective', 'repository', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'therapy development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2019,138842,-0.02673532985266509
"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9722280,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2019,129089,-0.005093232519546422
"Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood traumatic stress (CTS), resulting from experiences such as abuse and neglect, is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences effecting overall health across the lifespan. Growing evidence shows that the negative effects of CTS are not limited to a single individual and may be transmitted across generations, increasing the risk for behavioral and psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Psychological stress during pregnancy is associated with heightened stress responses, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral problems in infancy and early childhood potentially making it a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The majority of studies examining maternal psychological stress (MPS) during pregnancy consider the magnitude of stress as the `risk factor' for alterations in offspring development; however, psychological stress, particularly during the prenatal period, is dynamic and variable. Infant neurodevelopment occurs sequentially and is sensitive to environmental influences, meaning that the effect of any insult is likely as much about the timing, as it is the magnitude. As a result, it remains unclear which aspects of stress most strongly impact offspring development – is it simply the magnitude as previously suggested, or does the trajectory matter as well? Understanding the variability of prenatal factors and their influence on infant neurobiological and psychosocial development is critical to targeting preventive interventions. The goal of this proposal is to explore maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress. The overall hypothesis is that a history of maternal CTS will increase the amplitude and velocity of MPS trajectories compared to a low-risk group, will predict increased offspring limbic system connectivity and negative affect expression, and that an intervention to reduce MPS in a high-risk sample will alter the observed trajectories. These hypotheses will be tested using a novel methodology that characterizes the longitudinal heterogeneity of psychological symptom data to create MPS trajectories. These trajectories will be used to explore the role of timing and rate of change of MPS on offspring neurobiological and affective development and, further, to test whether these trajectories mediate the effects of CTS on infant development. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To characterize the longitudinal heterogeneity of MPS in a sample of women with and without a history of CTS; (2) To examine the effects of heterogeneous longitudinal trajectories in MPS on offspring limbic system and negative affect development in mothers with and without childhood trauma; and (3) (Exploratory) To determine whether an intervention designed to reduce MPS will alter MPS trajectories in a high-risk sample. This study aims to elucidate the importance of trajectories of MPS for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS. Achieving these goals will provide insight into the best timing for targeted screening and interventions to alter MPS during pregnancy for women with a history of CTS and, thereby, reduce the risk of offspring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood traumatic stress is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences for psychological well-being, such as increased stress reactivity and increased risk for perinatal psychopathology. The proposed research will integrate tools from developmental neuroscience, clinical science, and computer science to: (1) examine the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a potential mediator of childhood traumatic stress on infant brain and negative affect development; and (2) evaluate whether an intervention designed to reduce maternal psychological stress will alter the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal prenatal stress. By identifying the importance of trajectories of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS, this work stands to improve the targeting and timing of prenatal interventions for women with a history of childhood traumatic stress.",Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress,9794014,F30MH118762,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Limbic System', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'maternal stress', 'mindfulness based cognitive therapy', 'negative affect', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatric trauma', 'prenatal', 'prenatal intervention', 'prenatal stress', 'psychological symptom', 'psychosocial development', 'random forest', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'stress reactivity', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,3.126990955394809e-05
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis,9676982,K23MH116130,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Israel', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'computational basis', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'economic cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal course', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'responsible research conduct', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'smart watch', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIMH,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2019,190676,0.00023161027222236714
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9765987,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,646285,-0.0006481804335007303
"A preconception cohort study of environmental chemicals, fertility, and miscarriage ABSTRACT Infertility and spontaneous abortion (SAB) are significant public health problems, affecting up to 25% of reproductive age couples in the United States. Health care costs attributable to infertility and SAB exceed $5 billion per year, and several studies have shown an association between infertility treatments and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors for subfertility and SAB is an important public health goal. The potential effects of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on risk of subfertility and SAB are understudied. The few existing human studies have limitations including small sample size, enrollment after conception, retrospective study design, suboptimal assessment of exposure and outcome, inadequate control for potential confounding variables, and limited generalizability. The proposed study will prospectively assess the relation of exposure to selected EDCs, including phenols, phthalates, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), to risk of subfertility and SAB in a preconception subcohort of 950 pregnancy planners. We will use data from two NICHD-supported prospective cohorts of pregnancy planners in North America and Denmark. With web-based recruitment and data collection, we have enrolled over 17,000 women attempting pregnancy into these cohorts. In a subset of 200 participants, we have successfully pilot tested in-person collection of urine and blood specimens during the preconception and early pregnancy periods. In this application, we propose to expand in-person biospecimen collection, increasing the number of women with preconception and early pregnancy urine and blood samples from 200 to 950. At each of our three biospecimen collection sites (Boston, Detroit, and Aarhus), we will enroll 250 women and collect three urine samples and one blood sample (in preconception) and three urine samples and one blood sample (in early pregnancy). We will ship the samples to the CDC for the analysis of urinary phthalates, urinary phenols, and serum PFAS. To increase cost efficiency, we will pool three urine samples in each exposure window before assaying for phthalates and phenols; and we will assay one preconception blood specimen for PFAS, a persistent chemical, in analyses of subfertility and SAB. Finally, we will conduct a pilot study among 100 U.S. participants to assess the feasibility of collecting urine by mail, which would allow us to take advantage of our full geographically-diverse cohort in the future. Strengths of this application include the prospective design, preconception enrollment of pregnancy planners, repeated measurement of exposure during preconception and early pregnancy, excellent control for confounding via bimonthly prospective data collection on a wide range of covariates, and use of the latest analytic methods for mixtures modeling. We have generated compelling preliminary data to support our aims. The present grant is cost-effective in leveraging already-established cohort studies with data collection and follow-up supported by other grants. The results generated will be translatable by directly informing future regulatory decisions about EDC standards in a manner that could reduce rates of infertility and SAB. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nearly 15% of all couples have difficulty becoming pregnant and up to 25% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. Infertility and miscarriage can cause profound psychological and financial hardship for those affected, and they account for more than 5 billion dollars in U.S. health care costs each year.

"Improving the Pelvic Health of Women and Girls Through the Use of a Digital Coaching Platform ABSTRACT More than 50 million women suffer from pelvic health disorders (PHDs) in the United States, a number that is projected to nearly double by 2050. These conditions cost the healthcare system billions annually and negatively affect educational and employment opportunities, quality of life, and fertility of patients. While studies suggest that PHDs can be managed and improved with education, practitioners are often confronted with patients who delay seeking treatment until their symptoms and conditions are advanced. Below Your Belt (BYB) is developing a platform that disrupts the costly, painful, and stigmatizing cycle of poor pelvic health in the U.S. The platform is a mobile, web based, a consumer-facing chatbot, with a working name of CeCe, that delivers pelvic health information in a familiar, accessible manner. CeCe will engage Mom with interactive and medically accurate content, positioning her to become the central source of information for her family and her social network. BYB has developed and tested a functional prototype of CeCe, which is based on feedback received from hundreds of women surveyed. In Phase I, BYB, together with Northwestern University and a highly qualified team of consultants will optimize CeCe and test the feasibility and acceptability of a chatbot to deliver pelvic health information. In Aim 1, The current prototype will be examined and enhanced to a web-based platform. Simultaneously, verified conversational and educational material will be added to the existing content to make it more robust. Then, a round of usability testing will be conducted. Updates to content and functionality will be completed based on initial usability results, and if any issues are uncovered, they will be addressed before the start of Aim 2. In Aim 2, Northwestern University will conduct a larger usability and knowledge-gained study with 36 women (recruitment target of 30% low income women). Questionnaires will be used to ascertain whether participants had measurable increase in knowledge after completing the two-week interaction with CeCe and to assess ease of use/acceptance. Exit interviews will be conducted to gain qualitative data around ease of use, interest in CeCe, content preferences, perceptions of achievement in relation to increased awareness of pelvic health and confidence or comfort sharing pelvic health information. At the conclusion of Phase I, BYB will have successfully demonstrated that CeCe’s final prototype is an acceptable and feasible model for increasing pelvic health knowledge. In addition, BYB will have a complete assessment of CeCe’s acceptability and insight into participants’ 14-day experience with the chatbot, and an understanding of whether a mom might feel confident or comfortable sharing any information she has learned.

"Place-level discrimination and birth outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability. In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination partially contributes to this disparity. Most of research on discrimination and birth outcomes relies on self-reported experiences of discrimination, and there have been few studies examining discrimination at the U.S. national level. Social contexts in which greater hostility towards minorities is manifested may cause psychological stress and increase risk of adverse birth outcomes. The scientific objective of this research plan is to develop a new county-level indicator of discriminatory attitudes from social media data as well as make use hate crimes data and measures of explicit and implicit racial bias to provide a detailed and nuanced investigation of the impact of discrimination on birth outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities in birth outcomes. Another strength of this research plan is the longitudinal study design with multiple years of data for both measures of discrimination and birth outcomes, which allows us to control for temporal trends and stable characteristics of the counties. Furthermore, the influence of discrimination on birth outcomes may begin prior to pregnancy. There is increasing recognition of maternal health prior to conception influencing fetal development and birth outcomes. The project will empirically evaluate whether place-level discrimination is associated with biomarkers of chronic stress among young women of child-bearing age. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in: 1) developing expertise in Big Data, 2) measurement of discrimination, and 3) stress physiology and birth outcomes. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career evaluating how discrimination impact minority health and health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability. In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination partially contributes to this disparity.

"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations. With this study we propose to adapt a wildly popular method used in computer vision applications, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and develop flexible extensions for many epidemiologic settings. We propose to assess the performance of this method, compare with existing methods and employ in real-life applications, as well as develop and share software so other research can also use this novel, robust and flexible tool.",Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies,9617736,R01ES028805,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Situation', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Poison', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Work', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'pollutant', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,600285,0.004967781734068891
"Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of both existing physical mannequin-based training and virtual media to support clinical learning using Augmented Reality (AR). Significance: Education in clinical settings is often challenging, infeasible, risky, difficult to organize, time-consuming, and expensive. Due to these barriers, the value of mannequin-based simulation is well recognized and is incorporated extensively into medical education. In general, the purpose of mannequin use in education is to simulate a physical ""patient"" on which to learn, demonstrate, and test skill without fear of harming patients prior to entering clinical environments. Despite their substantial benefits, physical mannequins have several fundamental limitations that do not allow them to demonstrate the many unique phases and expressions of a disease or person-to-person differences in anatomy and physiology. This limits the ability for a learner to view dynamic changes over time and to explore disease progression and consequences of interventions. Hypothesis: This research hypothesizes that existing, current mannequins can be enhanced through an innovative and practical Augmented Reality solution. In the Phase I effort a prototype system and sample educational material covering Pressure Ulcer care was developed and analyzed through pilot studies with Nursing educators, Doctoral Degree in Nursing (DNP) students, and pre-licensure students. The pilot results of the technology demonstrated a high degree of positivity and exceptional enthusiasm and all Phase I metrics of success were met or exceeded. Specific Aims: In Phase II the following aims are proposed: 1) Design a comprehensive suite of course content and design the technology's integration into a College of Nursing course, 2) Develop a production-ready system, and 3) Validate the system utility through human subject testing and expert evaluation of the system. Project Narrative Over the past decade, medical simulation has been experiencing explosive growth and widespread adoption. There are now over 800 medical simulation centers in the US alone, located in medical schools, nursing schools, hospitals, military simulation centers, and schools of allied health professions. The global market for Mannequin-Based Simulation is projected to reach $1 Billion by 2020. It is hypothesized that the combination of existing physical mannequin-based training with virtual media will open new possibilities for exploration and enhanced learning interactions for medical education. 3T",Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults,9778054,R44AG057257,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Allied Health Profession', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Augmented Reality', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Course Content', 'Decubitus ulcer', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Materials', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Focus Groups', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Licensure', 'Location', 'Manikins', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Military Personnel', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Nursing Schools', 'Nursing Students', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Skin', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'animation', 'base', 'caregiver education', 'college', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'impression', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'miniaturize', 'person centered', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'teacher', 'virtual']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2019,779815,-0.044679014849754846
"Developing Computational Methods for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistant Agents PROJECT ABSTRACT  Antimicrobial resistance is a critical public health issue. Infections with drug resistant pathogens are estimated to cause an additional eight million hospitalization days annually over the hospitalizations that would be seen for infections with susceptible agents. The use of antibiotics (in both clinical and agricultural settings) is being viewed as precursor for these infections and thus, is a major public health concern—particularly as outbreaks become more frequent and severe. However, scientiﬁc evidence describing the hazards associated with antibiotic use is lacking due to inability to quantify the risk of these practices. One promising avenue to elucidate this risk is to use shotgun metagenomics to identify the AMR genes in samples taken through systematic spatiotemporal surveillance. The goal of this proposed work is to develop algorithms that will provide such a means for analysis. The algorithms need to be scalable to very large datasets and thus, will require the development and use succinct data structures.  In order to achieve this goal, the investigative team will develop the theoretical foundations and applied meth- ods needed to study AMR through the use of shotgun metagenomics. A major focus of the proposed work is developing algorithms that can handle very large datasets. To achieve this scalability, we will create novel means to create, compress, reconstruct and update very large de Bruijn graphs that metagenomics data in a manner needed to study AMR. In addition, we will pioneer the study of AMR through long read data by proposing new algorithmic problems and solutions that use data. For example, identifying the location of speciﬁc genes in a metagenomics sample using long read data has not been proposed or studied. Thus, the algorithmic ideas and techniques developed in this project will not only advance the study of AMR, but contribute to the growing domain of big data analysis and pan-genomics.  Lastly, we plan to apply our methods to samples collected from both agricultural and clinical settings in Florida. Analysis of preliminary and new data will allow us to conclude about (1) the public risk associated with antimicro- bial use in agriculture; (2) the effectiveness of interventions used to reduce resistant bacteria, and lastly, (3) the factors that allow resistant bacteria to grow, thrive and evolve. A–1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Antibiotic use in agriculture is a major public health concern that is receiving a lot of media attention, par- ticularly as antibiotic-resistant infections in become more frequent and severe. This research will build a novel bioinformatics framework for determining how antimicrobial resistant genes evolve, grow, and persist in a system that has been affected by antibiotic use. This will, in turn, facilitate the development of effective intervention methods that reduce resistant pathogens in clinical and agricultural settings.

"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of what children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well. This is relevant to the part of NIH's mission which focuses on the prevention of disease by supporting research in the diagnosis of human diseases.",Shape up!

"Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System Project Summary Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems offer substantial opportunities for helping people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve glucose control and lower HbA1c. However, the AID has only shown a benefit during the nighttime when meals, exercise, and stress do not significantly challenge the AID. Furthermore, hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) remains a common occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes and continues to occur even in the setting of AID, particularly with exercise. Integrating context awareness into an AID has the potential to improve glycemic time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during the daytime and reduce and possibly eliminate hypoglycemia. Contextual information can include inferred food intake, insulin dosing, inferred exercise type and duration, as well as movement patterns. An AID can be designed to recognize contextual patterns that relate to poor glycemic responses to meals and hypoglycemia and then adjust insulin dosing in response to these patterns in advance and help mitigate these problems. In this grant, we will explore how contextual information may be used within an AID to help (1) avoid hypoglycemia and (2) reduce postprandial dysglycemia. We will first conduct a data gathering study whereby we will collect a rich data set from people with T1D who will use sensor augmented pump therapy to manage their glucose. Data will be collected from these 30 patients over 28 days; data will include multivariable contextual information including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin data, food data, physical activity data (heart rate and accelerometry), as well as indoor/outdoor contextual movement patterns gathered using a novel beacon-based context-aware sensing system called MotioWear developed by our group in collaboration with our industry partner MotioSens. Next, we will utilize this contextual data set to construct a Bayesian glucose prediction algorithm. This will include a clustering algorithm that will group contextual sequences that are similar with each other and which lead to similar glycemic outcomes. This context-aware glucose prediction algorithm will be integrated into an adaptive, personalized, smartwatch-based context-aware AID (CA-AID) system. Contextual patterns that have a high likelihood of leading to hypoglycemia or postprandial dysglycemia will inform an insulin dosing aggressiveness factor to be adjusted for similar contextual sequences observed in the future (i.e. the CA-AID will reduce insulin for contextual sequences with high likelihood of hypoglycemia such as aerobic exercise). We expect that integrating context awareness into an AID will lead to significant improvements in time in target range during the day and will help reduce time in hypoglycemia. The CA-AID will be evaluated for safety in a small pilot study. We will then evaluate the CA-AID within a 6 week clinical study in 40 adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Twenty will receive the CA-AID while the other 20 will receive a standard (non-context-aware) AID. The primary outcome measures of this study is the percent time in range. We hypothesize that the CA-AID will increase time in range by 10% as compared with a non-context aware AID. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. While automated insulin delivery systems can help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their glucose levels during the night, improved glycemic control during the day has not been demonstrated and hypoglycemia continues to be a problem, especially during exercise. We propose to develop and evaluate in a clinical study a context-aware automated insulin delivery system that learns patterns of daily living, meal patterns, glucose patterns, insulin dosing patterns, and physical activity patterns that relate to dysglycemia and adapts the gains within the AID to improve postprandial time in target range (70-180 mg/dL) and reduce hypoglycemia.",Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System,9832864,R01DK122583,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pump', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'design', 'expectation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose sensor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'two-arm study', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,669616,-0.006765175718634597
"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes.

"Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents. PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Children and adolescents often grow up in the face of substantial developmental stress (i.e. trauma). While for some, this shifts the developmental trajectory to that of mental and general health disorders, others are resilient. Most research on developmental psychopathology is focused on risk while little is known on the mechanisms that confer resilience. The current study aims to identify biological (genomic, immune), psychological and cognitive mechanisms that underpin resilience in youth as defined by having low mood- anxiety and suicidal outcomes in youth with substantial developmental stress exposure (i.e. trauma and family history of depression). Elucidating resilience mechanisms has huge clinical implications as it will improve stratification of risk to develop depression and/or suicidal behavior, and could identify biological, psychological and cognitive targets that can inform development of future preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience, reducing the mental and general health adverse outcomes associated with childhood adversity. The study capitalizes on a large dataset of genotyped youths from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that have been comprehensively phenotyped for cognitive performance and psychopathology, and that reported substantial trauma exposure. The proposed research integrates genomic and cognitive data with clinical measures used to define resilience in cross sectional analysis of ~9500 PNC youths (Aim 1); incorporates longitudinal data of depression and suicide measures, pulled from electronic medical record in a subset of ~750 PNC youths (Aim 2); and relies on prospective data collection that includes immune profiling of selected PNC individuals to allow identification of immune signature of resilience (Aim 3). Integration of genomic with clinical, cognitive and immune data will allow predictive modeling, and Big Data driven analysis will allow identification of resilience mechanisms. The candidate is a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist physician scientist who is committed to translational research in youth at risk for psychiatric conditions. His overarching career goal is to develop methods for early identification of subclinical phenotypes before the onset of major psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression and suicide attempts) and, through neuroscience informed interventions, divert the developmental trajectory from that of risk to that of resilience. The career development plan capitalizes on a multidisciplinary mentorship team. It involves one-on one mentoring with the primary “clinical research” mentor as well as the genomic, biostatistical, neurocognitive and immune system expert co- mentors, integrated with hands on research supervision in data collection and statistical analysis, and didactic coursework and workshops. The program is tailored to meet research and training aims. The project will be conducted in the fostering environment of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, that will provide the academic mentorship and the required resources to execute the research and training aims, allowing the candidate to launch an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood adversities impose risk to general and mental health development, including youth depression and suicidal behavior, still most children are resilient. Through integration of genetic, clinical, cognitive and demographic data from research data and medical records, this study will identify mechanisms that underpin resilience in a generalizable large sample of community youth with substantial exposure to adversity. Understanding resilience mechanisms is a critical milestone on the mission to develop neuroscience informed preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience and reducing the health burden of early life adversity.",Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents.,9806213,K23MH120437,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Suicide attempt', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'child depression', 'childhood adversity', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'early life adversity', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'hands on research', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'research clinical testing', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'stress related disorder', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K23,2019,193644,-0.049319506388278915
"Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants PROJECT SUMMARY Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening, gastrointestinal (GI) emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. ""Leaky gut"", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal permeability (IP), is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC in preterm neonates. Early detection of leaky gut is essential to identify infants at risk for NEC to prevent and reduce disease severity. No clinical factor, routine laboratory test or biomarker alone or in combination have been described that identify preterm neonates with impaired intestinal barrier function who at increased risk for NEC. The goal of this study is to develop a rapid, non-invasive screening tool to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. We recently revealed rapid maturation of the intestinal barrier is strongly associated with clinical factors such as early breastmilk feeding, less antibiotic exposure and later post-menstrual age, and significantly higher abundance and metabolic activities of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Although the butyrate producing Clostridiales have been implicated in strengthening the intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing intestinal inflammation, it is unknown whether butyrate and potentially other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with neonatal intestinal barrier maturation. Our preliminary data revealed butyrate production pathways, in particular Pyruvate/Acetyl-CoA pathway are significantly more abundant in low IP subjects. In this study, we propose to validate a substantiated measure of fecal microbial and/or metabolic biomarkers combined with associated neonatal factors for a rapid, non-invasive screening test. We postulate that the level(s) of metabolic activities, particularly butyrate production and potentially other SCFAs via increased colonization of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium, are associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates. To address our hypothesis, we will leverage existed stool samples collected from a cohort of ~200 preterms (<33 weeks), for whom both microbiota (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and IP (urine non-metabolized sugar probes lactulose and rhamnose) are available, and propose 2 aims: 1) to determine fecal metabolic activities associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestation; and 2) to identify and characterize butyrate-producing bacteria associated with intestinal permeability in preterm neonates during the first 7-10 days of life. At the completion of the study, we will determine the biomarkers associated with healthy intestinal barrier functions and the discriminatory scheme for accurate classification of high or low IP group. Our long-term goal is to conduct a randomize clinical trial of rationally designed intervention for NEC early prevention. Refinement of the screening tool will identify infants with aberrant leaky gut, an essential prerequisite for subsequent rational design of novel strategies such as clinical trials of probiotics to promote healthy intestinal barrier functions to reduce NEC incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE ""Leaky gut"", is the proximate cause of susceptibility to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening, gastrointestinal emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. This proposal will develop and validate a rapid, non-invasive screening test incorporating microbiome-based markers and associated neonatal factors, to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. The results of this study will support clinical trials aimed to optimize intestinal maturation and to reduce the burden of NEC complications. This study will address major knowledge gaps of the intestinal microenvironment in preterm infants, and ultimately lead to improved strategies to manage neonatal gastrointestinal health, improve children’s health and quality of life, all which are within the mission of NIDDK.",Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants,9872417,R21DK123674,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Butyrates', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epithelial', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Milk', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Leaky Gut', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Necrosis', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Pyruvate', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Urine', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'early screening', 'feeding', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sex', 'stool sample', 'sugar', 'supervised learning', 'therapy design']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2019,231750,-0.010909577254842007
"Optimism and Exceptional Longevity Project Abstract Studies across a range of organisms establish that significant increases in longevity are often accompanied by delayed morbidity; thus research to evaluate risk factors and mechanisms underlying longevity may yield new insights for interventions to improve the public’s health with aging. In particular, African Americans experience higher mortality, and greater morbidity for many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, the most common cause of death in the U.S. Identifying new factors linked to longevity in Blacks could therefore be especially meaningful. This competing revision supplement to “Optimism and Exceptional Longevity” (R01 AG53273), is designed to enhance our research on optimism, longevity, and underlying mechanisms, by extending work on predominantly Caucasian men and women in the Nurses’ Health Study and Normative Aging Study to African Americans. Growing evidence consistently links positive psychological attributes such as optimism to favorable health outcomes, suggesting they may be powerful health assets. In our current R01 we have already found strong relations of higher optimism to lower mortality, after control for confounders including depression. Preliminary data indicate similar associations of optimism to health for White and for Black women in the Nurses’ Health Study; but, the small sample of Blacks precludes substantive research and motivates the current application. Specifically, consistent with our parent R01, we propose to conduct novel, important investigations of optimism and longevity focusing on African Americans. We will leverage existing data from the Jackson Heart Study of 5000 Black men and women, and the Women’s Health Initiative of 14,000 Black (and 135,000 White) women. In Aim 1, we will examine if optimism is related to increased likelihood of healthy behaviors (e.g., physical activity) and longevity in Blacks, as well as test health behaviors as mediators of the optimism-longevity relation. In Aim 2, we will investigate the association of optimism with slower biologic aging (e.g., leukocyte telomere length and epigenetic age, a validated score based on DNA methylation) in Blacks. We also include an exploratory Aim 3 to expand research on optimism by combining insights from natural language processing, machine learning and psychology to develop an unobtrusive measure of optimism, utilizing Facebook posts. We will develop an algorithm to measure optimism with social media data and compare it to traditional optimism scales, consider possible biases in using social media for health-related research, and begin to test the optimism algorithm against individual health outcomes. In summary, the proposed research will provide an in-depth assessment of optimism, longevity, and an array of behavioral and biological factors in African Americans, that are important in their own right and relevant to many health endpoints – suggesting novel ways to improve health. We will also begin to expand tools for measuring optimism with the goal of enabling substantial new research opportunities for studying health assets. Project Narrative Building on prior work suggesting that optimism leads to more favorable health outcomes, we propose to examine the relationship of optimism to greater longevity and to evaluate biological and behavioral mechanisms that can explain the health enhancing effects of optimism, focusing on populations including large numbers of African Americans in whom there has been limited research. In addition, we will explore development of novel, unobtrusive measures of optimism derived from social media for use in population- based research. Our proposed work has the potential to advance understanding of novel ways to increase longevity in African Americans who have higher mortality than Caucasians, and also to advance the study of health assets and health by exploring new methods of assessing optimism, a potentially potent health asset.",Optimism and Exceptional Longevity,9448464,R01AG053273,"['African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caucasians', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic Disease', 'Consent', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Length', 'Leukocytes', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Research', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'SF-36', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'health data', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimism', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'social media', 'telomere', 'tool']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2018,444351,-0.025276628923856934
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9464374,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2018,470142,0.001516153445174404
"Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping ABSTRACT  Symptom-based classification approaches based on the DSM 5 are often not supported by epidemiological, genetic, and clinical neuroimaging research and may impede the advancement of interventions that target the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health disorders. A novel alternative to classifying psychopathology based on presenting clinical symptoms is to identify neurobiologically-informed biotypes. Individuals are clustered according to shared patterns of brain dysfunction using data-driven machine learning techniques to reveal the heterogeneous biological mechanisms that underlie comorbid disorders. Internalizing symptoms often first begin during development, suggesting that this is a critical period of vulnerability. Additionally, strong sex differences are found in anxiety and depressive symptoms, starting in adolescence. Thus, studies are needed that examine sex differences in the neurobiological mechanisms associated with internalizing symptoms during development. The purpose of the current study is to uncover the neurobiological heterogeneity associated with internalizing symptoms in youth. During the K99 phase, Aim 1 will use machine-learning techniques to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity among youth with anxiety and depressive disorders using multimodal neuroimaging data from a large community-based sample of over 1,200 youth studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; Training phase). We will test these heterogeneous patterns on a hold-out sample from the same cohort to examine the model’s validity (Validation phase). While the PNC provides an ideal dataset for developing a model, it does not have paradigms relevant to fear and anxiety that would allow us to identify important phenotypic differences between biotypes. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the generalizability of this model in an independent sample collected during the R00 phase, and further characterize these biotypes using pertinent measures related to error and reward processing. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate how sex differences in brain development associate with heterogeneous neural patterns in internalizing symptoms. Dr. Kaczkurkin’s long-term goal is to establish an independent research program where she will use advanced multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to study the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders in youth. This study will provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on the PNC database at the University of Pennsylvania to develop a well-validated model while also collecting a refined independent dataset, which will provide Dr. Kaczkurkin with the training and experience needed to transition to an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will provide critical knowledge regarding the neurobiological heterogeneity in youth with mood and anxiety disorders. A greater comprehension of how abnormalities in brain function give rise to these symptoms in adolescence is critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. Such knowledge would benefit public health by reducing the costs and burden of internalizing symptoms on the society at large. !",Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping,9583383,K99MH117274,"['Adolescence', 'Affective', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Atrophic', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Comprehension', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Phobias', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Societies', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'critical period', 'depressive symptoms', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'male', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'programs', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'reward processing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2018,109900,-0.015072779718470111
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9453227,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'computer science', 'craving', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2018,166481,0.0055587465795541025
"Strengthening Families Program Online Web Version for Teens ABSTRACT  This SBIR Phase I project uses formative evaluation strategies to develop, test, refine, and evaluate an alpha prototype of the 10-session, evidence-based Strengthening Families Program 7-17 and SFP Home-Use DVD as a web-assisted platform. The Specific Aim of the new “SFP Online!” program is to increase family accessibility and engagement by transitioning from costly group-based, facilitator-led, parenting and family skills training to low cost web-delivery. SFP draws heavily on theories that integrate family dynamics (monitoring, bonding, and communication), parenting skills, youth drug etiology (risk and protective factors), and social learning. Substantial empirical evidence from 14 RCTs with diverse families and locations shows that SFP works with large program effect sizes to reduce behavioral health risks and substance abuse. Phase I will determine whether the adapted online version can reproduce outcomes of the facilitator-led family group version with minimal loss of fidelity, efficacy, and vitality. Five integrated formative evaluation strategies involving 380 participants including ten focus groups with potential end users (100 parents and 100 youth) from SFP providers nationwide will explore adaptations, usability, feasibility and barriers to use. Consumer preference surveys tapping both recent SFP DVD users and agency service providers will explore factors that may mitigate or enhance delivery of SFP Online. This approach based on input from both parents and youth and providers will ensure that SFP Online is culturally and developmentally appropriate. We will also rely on key informant interviews with 50 family service providers and community stakeholders to address barriers to implementation and the eventual integration of SFP Online into existing prevention and treatment strategies. We will include interviews with prevention scientists and e-learning experts to review the architectural plan and ensure fidelity to current prevention and technology initiatives. These consumer surveys will inform a product specification plan supporting a “wireframe technology” to make SFP Online a viable web-assisted program. To create the alpha prototype in Phase I SFP LLC will collaborate with 3C Institute, a leading software development company with extensive expertise building interactive multimedia technology for behavioral health interventions. 3C Institute will employ its proprietary Dynamic e-Learning Platform (DeLP), a customizable technology that integrates the latest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. LARS Research Institute, a leading behavioral technology transfer company will assist in the evaluation of the program’s adherence to the standards of evidence. We will also draw on extensive community support based on 30 years of administering SFP products to family service agencies nationwide and other CBOs that emphasize parent training, and drug and child maltreatment prevention. The proposed formative evaluation strategies and collaboration with ten national prevention and e-learning experts should ensure timely and successful completion of the Phase I research activities and produce an effortless transition to the Phase II build-and-test stage. Project Narrative – SFP Online! This Phase I SBIR study seeks to adapt the Strengthening Families Program, an evidence-based facilitator-led family skills training and youth drug prevention program with family classes and entertaining video clips, to a web-based platform. Providing parenting training and drug prevention via the web offers tremendous cost savings and provides an efficient conduit for mass dissemination. The proposal utilizes five formative evaluation strategies to examine the steps required for technological adaptation and which will retain program and implementation fidelity.",Strengthening Families Program Online Web Version for Teens,9557402,R43DA046238,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Consumer Preferences', 'Cost Savings', 'Cultural Sensitivity', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Prevention Program', 'E-learning', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Evidence based program', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Family Relationship', 'Family dynamics', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Location', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Program Evaluation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Sexuality', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Problems', 'Speed', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vehicle crash', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral health intervention', 'child protection', 'child protective service', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'court', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'formative assessment', 'foster care', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'informant', 'innovation', 'interactive multimedia', 'mindfulness', 'preference', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'rehearsal', 'satisfaction', 'scaffold', 'service providers', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social learning', 'social media', 'social skills', 'software development', 'theories', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIDA,"STRENGTHENING FAMILIES PROGRAM, LLC",R43,2018,150054,-0.016205330969333454
"Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior  Using a Smart Wearable Device  Lifestyle and behavioral factors, such as diet, physical activity, and sedentary behavior, play important roles in human health. A recent report in Lancet has found that, globally, among the top-17 risk factors of human diseases, “diet risks”, “child and maternal malnutrition” and “low physical activity” ranked No.1, No. 3 and No. 14, respectively. Due to the increased adoption of unhealthy lifestyle, such as high-calorie, low-nutrient diet and decreased physical activity, chronic diseases are rising rapidly. For example, from 1980 to 2014, worldwide diabetic cases increased from 108 million to 422 million, and Americans’ life expectancy declined in 2015 for the first time since 1993. In order to assist the research community to study people’s lifestyle and develop effective interventional strategies, especially for chronic diseases such as diabetes to control their diet and increase physical activity, we have developed the eButton. The eButton is a miniature wearable computer pinned on the chest region to assess diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior. After several generations of redesigns, the eButton has now been shrunk to the size of an Oreo cookie while its functionality has greatly increased. We have conducted several studies evaluating the eButton with both adults and children. Our studies have shown that this device is well accepted by human subjects, and is suitable for collecting passively and conveniently large amounts of lifestyle data in real-life. However, post processing of field-collected data has been time-consuming, mainly due to required manual procedures to review thousands of images for identification of eating and other events of research interest. Privacy concerns were also expressed by some participants on recording images in their living and working environments and manual review of the recorded images. These significant problems must be solved before this important tool is utilized for large-scale clinical studies.  Powerful solution to solve these problems can be found in the most recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). By equipping the eButton with the AI capacity, we can effectively transform this passive data collection device to a mini-robot that travels with the human subject, observes the world around it, takes quick notes (in English text) at an astonishing speed, stores these notes in a compact form within the eButton, and discards raw images immediately except for food images which may need a dietitian to analyze. If this new concept can be successfully implemented, there will be no need to review thousands of images, and the risk of privacy breach is avoided because sensitive images are no longer stored within the device. Since the eButton will only be taught to recognize a limited number of dietary activities, physical activity and sedentary behaviors, this device will produce the desired information of research interest, but will never cross the privacy intrusion boundary.  In this application, our team of experienced engineers and lifestyle scientists proposes to implement this new concept. We will develop an efficient human activity recognition algorithm personalized for each human subject. This algorithm utilizes both the subject’s daily routine information and the information extracted from selected sensors. The data from these sensors will be examined sequentially to test the validity of a number of candidate activities. We will develop miniature electronic circuits to implement a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) within the eButton. This field- programmable gate array (FPGA) based implementation will enable real-time robotic reading of images and integrate the textual notes produced by the CNN with the personalized human activity recognition algorithm. Finally, we will perform a thorough evaluation study using human subjects to determine the accuracy of our activity recognition approach. This application aims to develop a personalized human activity recognition algorithm and to implement this algorithm using electronic hardware within a wearable device for the assessment of diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Automatic Recognition of Diet, Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Using a Smart Wearable Device",9717583,R56DK113819,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calories', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Descriptor', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietitian', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Malnutrition', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Wearable Computer', 'Weight', 'Workplace', 'base', 'blind', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diabetic', 'digital', 'digital models', 'disorder risk', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'healthy lifestyle', 'human disease', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lifestyle data', 'lifestyle factors', 'mathematical model', 'negative affect', 'programs', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'theories', 'tool', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R56,2018,489821,-0.015216479199263378
"Assess and Model the Health Effects, Population, and Infrastructural Vulnerabilities of Power Outage PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Climate change will lead to more intense and longer-lasting extreme weather events, such as floods, hurricanes, and severe storms, which will lead to more frequent power outage (PO). Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the impact of PO on human health: most previous studies were based on self-reported survey data, which is subject to reporting bias. In addition to weather factors that directly affect human health, other concurrent factors such as PO may also mediate with extreme weather on health, for which research is also lacking. Few studies assessed both power infrastructures and population vulnerabilities, and compared the effects of different PO causes. Furthermore, no health prediction models have been developed for PO. To fill these knowledge gaps, the proposed study will build upon multiple ongoing/ completed studies to: 1) assess the effects and mediating pathways of PO on electricity-dependent health outcomes, co-morbidities, and nursing home transfers; 2) identify infrastructure, environmental, and population vulnerabilities (individual and community); and 3) develop a vulnerability index and prediction model. We will effectively link the accessible New York statewide hospital admission and emergency department (ED) visit data with the existing data on PO, weather, air pollution, census, and nursing home transfer data. The associations between PO causes, frequency, duration, or area coverage of PO and electricity-dependent hospitalizations or ED visits due to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dialysis, water-/food-borne diseases, injury, and carbon monoxide poisoning will be assessed through Bayesian spatial-temporal model. This advanced technique will be able to control for both socio-demographic differences by regions and multiple temporal variables simultaneously. To improve scientific rigor, we will use control days (without PO and extreme weather) to separate PO from weather effects, and control diseases (e.g. appendicitis) to examine temporal changes of disease reporting. To understand PO’s natural direct and indirect effects, causal mediation analysis will be used. Furthermore, new variable selection methods, including Sure Independence Screening and Generalized Additive Model Selection will be used to screen and select predictors highly associated with outcomes. A composite vulnerability index weighed by risk factors identified and vulnerability maps will be developed. We will establish PO and PO-related health predictive models using the state-of-the-art data mining techniques, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Tree, and Ensemble Learning Decision Tree model. The excellent team with multidisciplinary and experienced investigators, numerous already collected and geocoded datasets, innovative data mining and analysis methods, continuation of student training, and successful prior partnerships with government agencies will maximize the probability of our success and feasibility. This project will also significantly enhance our institute’s environment and students’ involvement in research, and our findings will identify evidence-based strategies for emergency management and public health preparedness. NARRATIVE The proposed study will evaluate whether frequency, duration, coverage, and certain causes of power outage (PO) are associated with increased risks of electricity-dependent diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dialysis, water-/food-borne diseases, injury, and carbon monoxide poisoning. This may be the first study to assess whether people with certain demographic characteristics (e.g. elderly or different sex), living in a neighborhood with certain vulnerabilities (e.g. high land coverage or low hospital density), in certain seasons, degree of urbanicity, or specific causes of PO are more vulnerable to the impact of PO. The findings, vulnerability index and maps, and the forecast models derived from this study will help guide the state or federal environmental and health agencies to plan interventions and climate adaptation programs.","Assess and Model the Health Effects, Population, and Infrastructural Vulnerabilities of Power Outage",9440510,R15ES028000,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Appendicitis', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Carbon Monoxide Poisoning', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Climate', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electricity', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Equipment Failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Floods', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Geographic Factor', 'Government Agencies', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hurricane', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neighborhoods', 'New York', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'climate change', 'climate impact', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder control', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'extreme heat', 'foodborne', 'forest', 'health data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'screening', 'sex', 'student training', 'success']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT ALBANY,R15,2018,443750,-0.059432097517845554
"Wireless Movement Sensing System for People with Severe Disabilities Abstract The ability of people with severe physical impairment to participate in family life, communication, work, or recreation is severely restricted without access to assistive technology (AT). Yet, as disability severity increases, so does the challenge to finding (1) an access movement that a person can perform to control AT and (2) an access technology that can detect the access movement. We propose to create a wireless movement sensing system that can learn a user’s access movement and then recognize that movement in order to wirelessly control assistive devices. Once we complete the technology development, we will measure the sensitivity and specificity of our wireless movement sensing system using the movements of ten people with SPI. We will present our results to AT experts during a focus group session and determine the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the technology. This Phase 1 research is proposed by a multidisciplinary research team consisting of AT engineers, AT clinicians, and a machine learning expert.

"DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease Project Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous: it has many subtypes and the disease progresses at different rates in different subtypes. Disease progression in early-stage PD is observed as signal changes in SPECT imaging with 123I-FP-CIT, which is called DaTscan imaging, or simply DaTscan. The goal of the research proposed here is to create accurate models of heterogeneous PD progression using DaTscan images. Such models will not only provide additional insight into PD, but they are also critically important in assessing the effect of neuro-protective therapy. A new set of models called mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) are proposed to model early-state PD progression as it manifests in DaTscans. MLDS models combine machine-learning methods with linear dynamical system theory. They capture many features of early-stage PD progression: laterality, non-linear progression, as well as PD heterogeneity. Preliminary results show that, MLDS is accurate, finds progression subtypes, relates well to clinical data (MDS-UPDRS motor scores), and gives genuinely new insights about PD progression. The proposed research aims to develop the MLDS methodology in region-of-interest as well as voxel-based frameworks. A detailed discussion of the MLDS theory, model fitting, and the relation to clinical data is included. Longitudinal DaTscan images as well as MDS-UPDRS motor scores are available for over 440 subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), and this data set will be used along with MLDS to create the PD progression models. Project Narrative How Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses is poorly understood. This research proposes to develop precise disease progression models for PD using machine-learning. These models will give greater insight into PD progression and also help assess PD therapy.",DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease,9574626,R01NS107328,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Glean', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Theory', 'Work', 'base', 'disease heterogeneity', 'dopamine transporter', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'model design', 'neuron loss', 'presynaptic', 'progression marker', 'putamen', 'research clinical testing', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'uptake']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,345666,-0.022768578843672716
"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9544317,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Self-Administered', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'salivary assay', 'secondary analysis', 'self reported behavior', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),K01,2018,164330,-0.015249836432469995
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9612862,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,547853,-0.020254871208012303
"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief. These findings may advance understanding of the process of grief, facilitate early identification of high-risk grievers and potentially form the basis for targeted treatment of complicated grief.",Predicting complicated grief from grief processing,9527376,K23MH114021,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Down-Regulation', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Guilt', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Reaction Time', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Stimulus', 'Suicide', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Trauma', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intense pain', 'loved ones', 'neural patterning', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'sustained attention', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K23,2018,199797,-0.019237528082636932
"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,9595726,R01AI135115,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladeshi', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholera', 'Cholera Vaccine', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Haiti', 'Haitian', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sanitation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Standardization', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Vibrio cholerae O1', 'Water', 'age related', 'base', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,750105,-0.012318087064427309
"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,9539584,R01HD092331,"['Academia', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Crime', 'Criminology', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Family', 'Firearms', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Security', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'behavioral outcome', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'convict', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'developmental psychology', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'repeat offender', 'social', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2018,708752,-0.005300488734580428
"A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets Abstract A considerable proportion of outdoor physical activity is done on sidewalk/streets. For example, we found that ~70% of adults who walked during the previous week used the sidewalks/streets around their homes. Interventions conducted at geographical levels (e.g., community) and studies examining relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., traffic) and walking/biking, necessitate a reliable measure of physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The Block Walk Method (BWM) is one of the more common approaches available for this purpose. Although it utilizes reliable observation techniques and displays criterion validity, it remains relatively unchanged since its introduction in 2006. It is a non-technical, labor-intensive, first generation method. Advancing the BWM would contribute significantly to our understanding of physical activity behavior. Therefore, the objective of the proposed study is to develop and test a new BWM that utilizes a wearable video device (WVD) and computer video analysis to assess physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The following aims will be completed to accomplish this objective. Aim 1: Improve the BWM by incorporating a WVD into the methodology. The WVD is a pair of eyeglasses with a high definition video camera embedded into the frames. We expect the WVD to be a viable option for improving the acquisition and accuracy of data collected using the BWM. Aim 2: Advance the WVD-enhanced BWM by applying machine learning and recognition software to automatically extract information on physical activities occurring on the sidewalks/streets from the videos. Methods: Trained observers (one wearing and one not wearing the WVD) will walk together at a set pace along predetermined, 1000 ft. sidewalk/street segments representing low, medium, and high walkable areas. During the walks, the non-WVD observer will use the traditional BWM to record the number of individuals standing/sitting, walking, biking, and running along the segments. The WVD observer will only record a video while walking. Later, two investigators will view the videos to determine the numbers of individuals performing physical activities along the segments. For aim 2, the video data will be analyzed automatically using multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the number of humans in a segment as well as the type of physical activities being performed. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees) will be assessed using moderator analyses. We expect the new approach will enhance measurement accuracy while reducing the burden of data collection. In the future, we will expand the capabilities of the WVD-CNNs system to allow for the determination of other characteristics captured by the videos such as caloric expenditure and environmental conditions. Our long-term goal is to substantially improve the assessment of physical activity and our understanding of physical activity behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sidewalks and streets are public spaces where a considerable amount of physical activity occurs. As such, accurate and feasible methods are important for understanding the role these areas play in facilitating physical activity and improving public health. In the proposed study, we will develop and test a state-of-the-art, observation approach using a wearable video device and computer technology to measure physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. Findings have the potential to significantly impact research in this area and inform the further development of technology-enhanced observation methods for widespread, practical applications that promote healthy lifestyles and reduce chronic disease risks across the age spectrum.",A cutting edge approach to assessing physical activities occurring on sidewalks/streets,9586309,R21HL143553,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Error Sources', 'Expenditure', 'Eyeglasses', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Social Environment', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Trees', 'Walking', 'advanced system', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'healthy lifestyle', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'national surveillance', 'novel strategies', 'physical inactivity', 'physical science', 'practical application', 'success', 'technology development', 'walkability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R21,2018,232214,-0.0034233693830264937
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,9520444,R01NS086885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'Amnesia', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iraq', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'concussive symptom', 'executive function', 'gray matter', 'inattention', 'interest', 'mechanical force', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood symptom', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'persistent symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,347813,-0.017444267696380942
"Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) includes serious threats to maternal health and survival that occur at delivery or postpartum. SMM, which includes postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, sepsis, and other serious conditions, can be life-threatening and have long-term effects on a woman’s health as well as adversely impact her infant’s health and well-being. Over the past 15 years, the prevalence of SMM has doubled in the U.S., currently affecting more than 65,000 women each year. Additionally, the prevalence of SMM is highest in women of minority races and ethnicities, particularly women who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. However, the most important risk factors for SMM are not established and it is unknown what is contributing to racial/ethnic disparities and increasing trends in SMM. Our goal is to improve the understanding of SMM and its risk factors to provide evidence that supports efforts to reduce the prevalence of SMM and racial/ethnic disparities in SMM. The proposed project will use linked vital statistics, patient discharge, and U.S. Census data for over 4 million births in California from 2007 to 2014. We will test trends in SMM prevalence and calculate the population attributable risks for three key potential risk factors—advanced maternal age, prepregnancy obesity, and cesarean delivery—and their combination across the years of study (Aim 1). Additionally, we will examine a wide range of potential risk factors to identify those that are most important using a machine-learning/data-adaptive approach (Aim 2). Both study aims will be done in the overall sample and separately in racial/ethnic groups. Understanding SMM trends and determining the strongest predictors of SMM are critical steps to launch forward research of this pressing and understudied public health problem. Many factors may present crucial opportunities to prevent the development severe maternal morbidity—saving the lives of mothers and helping ensure a healthy future for their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year, more and more new mothers are diagnosed with serious pregnancy-related medical conditions, particularly mothers who identify as racial/ethnic minorities. Research is urgently needed to understand what is driving this alarming problem and what puts women most at risk so future research can be conducted to guide interventions and clinical care for childbearing women.","Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities",9485199,F32HD091945,"['Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Age', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patient Discharge', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Population Study', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Vital Statistics', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'advanced maternal age', 'base', 'child bearing', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'improved', 'indexing', 'maternal morbidity', 'outcome prediction', 'prepregnancy', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'social', 'trend']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,58392,-0.012661806123187434
"Adolescent Personality and the Incidence of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Related Dementias in Later Life. Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s related dementias (ADRD) are now regarded as a public health problem of pressing importance. While the race for disease-altering treatments continues, another strand of work has focused on identifying social and psychological precursors of these conditions. Such biopsychosocial risks often can be traced back to phases of life that predate symptom onset by years or decades. Therefore, a robust social and life course epidemiology of ADRD requires study designs that feature a) broad and deep psychosocial characterization of b) a large, population-relevant cohort c) during early phases of life, with d) medically-documented outcome data. Parent project R01AG053155 features a) through c), specifically in 90,000 members of the Project Talent cohort assessed in 1960 and again in 1970-74. The current supplement expands its scope to all members of Project Talent baseline (roughly 340,000) from 1960, and focuses on two scientific aims. The first seeks to estimate the relative risk of ADRD by the early 70s arising from adolescent personality traits, as documented in Medicare data linked to the cohort. One key feature of this aim is to determine if aspects of personality in adolescence are associated with ADRD incidence in later life independently of adolescent IQ, which is a known predictor. The second key aspect of this aim is to use the size and population representativeness of the sample to derive reasonably precise population-relevant effect size estimates of personality relative risks, and compare these effect sizes to benchmark risk estimates of adolescent IQ and socioeconomic status, which are considered to have policy and public health significance. The second aim also leverages the size and scope of the sample to identify personality traits which may moderate the ADRD risk of low adolescent IQ, in more complex and realistic patterns than can be studied in smaller or less representative data sets. This is accomplished via machine learning methods focused on identifying non-linear interactions via intensive cross-validation, another scientific question that takes full advantage of the size and scope of this unique cohort. Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s related dementias are on the rise, due to both increasing life spans and the size of the Baby Boom generation as it reaches these later years. While scientists have yet to develop cures for dementias, it may be possible to learn how to prevent or delay their onset by studying life circumstances that give rise to these conditions. The goal of this project is to determine how personality traits in adolescence may compensate for the dementia risk posed by low adolescence IQ scores.",Adolescent Personality and the Incidence of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Related Dementias in Later Life.,9688395,R01AG053155,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Baby Booms', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deltastab', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biopsychosocial', 'cohort', 'epidemiologic data', 'exhaustion', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'parent project', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'public health priorities', 'social', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2018,287001,-0.05315404778927889
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project focuses on human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife, with an emphasis on factors that moderate and mediate brain-to- risk relationships.

"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,9524533,R01DK114945,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Patterning', 'Body fat', 'Calibration', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population Group', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age group', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'older women', 'performance tests', 'response', 'scale up', 'sedentary', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,712358,-0.04701747759028169
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9598047,K99ES028743,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2018,81281,-0.016637539751452407
"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9428459,R01MH059929,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Exposure to', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'clinical imaging', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'information processing', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'pre-clinical', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'symptomatology', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,643008,-0.008834772455466159
"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators).

"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9526588,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2018,141114,0.0061643922574316475

"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9682871,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2018,40644,-0.0031223552953587716
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9577994,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2018,755313,-0.010557571419380575
"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,9505590,K01HL141637,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perceived quality of life', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Professional Organizations', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health data', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'patient expectation', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'skills', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'working group']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,163291,-0.005357044378153627
"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms. Expertise in clinical, computational, and technology disciplines form the team to realize these goals. This is a study that focuses on the ability of technological methods to detect speech and behavioral patterns in patients with bipolar disorder across cultural boundaries to identify common features that predict mood states. The overall goal is to use computational methods for the early detection of affect and mood changes that will provide the opportunity to monitor mood disorders using common methods regardless of cultural differences.",MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures,9566306,R21MH114835,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'American', 'Arabs', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Immigrant', 'Immigration', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lebanon', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multilingualism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data management', 'design', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'health data', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'markov model', 'mobile computing', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2018,30000,-0.06208124923874538
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9501395,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,798023,-0.02359232504234224
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9513489,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental arm', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'weight loss program', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2018,705027,-0.017066100011731485
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9593182,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Generic Drugs', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,466099,-0.01409187974680741
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,9583334,K99HD096125,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Childbirth', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Ductal Epithelial Cell', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Excretory function', 'Failure', 'Fetal Mortality Statistics', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Nephrons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Organ', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'associated symptom', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'early onset', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'maternal serum', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pregnancy disorder', 'premature', 'prevent', 'response', 'stillbirth', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'uptake', 'urinary']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,K99,2018,104534,-0.04535874275961073
"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9540891,K99ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'tool']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2018,88012,-0.05798738846657969
"Advancing a novel portable detection method for cannabis intoxication Intoxication from marijuana (MJ) impairs psychomotor performance and at least doubles the risk of motor vehicle accidents. The ongoing wave of legalization of MJ has brought increasing prevalence of driving while intoxicated with MJ. However, there is no quantitative biologic test that can accurately determine whether an individual is acutely impaired from MJ intoxication. Assays of the primary intoxicating substance in MJ, THC, in body fluids has a high false negative rate as THC is cleared from blood within 15 minutes, long before impairment is resolved. And assays of THC metabolites yield a high false positive rate because clearance of these metabolites can take weeks. Thus there is now no nor is there likely to ever be a test of blood, breath or body fluids that can accurately detect MJ intoxication. In response to this significant knowledge gap, this project aims to develop an accurate, portable method for detection of impairment due to MJ intoxication using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS is a non-invasive, safe brain imaging technique that capitalizes on differences in the light absorption spectra of deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), that allows the measurement of relative changes in Hb concentration that reflect brain activity. fNIRS can be performed in natural environments at low cost, and thus can be used in real-world settings. In Phase I, we will develop an algorithm for individual-level detection of impairment from THC using fNIRS measurements. To do so, we will assess the effect of oral THC (or placebo) on fNIRS measurements, self-reported intoxication, and impairment as defined by the gold standard field sobriety test conducted by a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) in 40 healthy MJ users. fNIRS assessments will examine (1) the effect of THC exposure on resting state and task-based activation in the prefrontal cortex, (2) the extent to which impairment in psychomotor functioning with THC administration correlates with THC-induced change in hemodynamic responses detected with fNIRS, and (3) the sensitivity and specificity and area under the ROC curve of fNIRS measurements and field sobriety test determinants of impairment. Milestone: Should machine learning applications to the data generate an algorithm that predicts impairment with >80% accuracy compared with a gold standard field sobriety test, we will proceed to Phase II. In Phase II, we will conduct fNIRS testing in 150 individuals under THC/placebo as in Phase I and in 50 individuals in a THC plus alcohol/placebo condition in order to further refine the algorithm for MJ impairment detection such that fNIRS detection concurs with field sobriety testing with >90% specificity. It is anticipated that this level of specificity could be used in legal definitions of impairment. This will warrant commercialization, which will be followed by prototype development and field testing. An accurate, quantitative, biological test that is user-friendly and enables law enforcement to detect impairment from MJ has the potential to dramatically change practice of law enforcement across the country and the world and thus has enormous commercial potential, as outlined in the Commercialization Plan and in accompanying letters of support. The goal of this project is to develop, test, and refine a method to accurately and reliably detect marijuana (MJ) impairment using a portable, user-friendly, non-invasive, brain-based modality. MJ doubles the chance of motor vehicle accidents, yet, there now exists no valid, biologically based method to detect whether an individual is acutely impaired from MJ. The development of a reliable, quantitative biological marker that enables law enforcement officers to screen individuals whom they suspect are impaired from MJ will have highly significant public health importance and enormous commercial potential.",Advancing a novel portable detection method for cannabis intoxication,9541180,R42DA043977,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Body Fluids', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cannabis', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Country', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Driving While Intoxicated', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Legal', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Oral', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Psychomotor Impairments', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'System', 'THC exposure', 'Testing', 'Tetrahydrocannabinol', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Vendor', 'absorption', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'behavior test', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'density', 'detector', 'driving under influence', 'drug testing', 'field sobriety tests', 'field study', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'interest', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana user', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'response', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vehicular accident']",NIDA,"HIGHLIGHTI, INC",R42,2018,731789,-0.01759201688364537
"Understanding the impact of environmental disruption in biological timing systems through signal processing. Project Summary/Abstract.  Life on Earth evolved to take time cues from the Sun. Consequently, most or all cells in the mammalian body use genetic feedback loops to time their daily (circadian) rhythms. When a person or any mammal sees light, that winds an orchestrating circadian brain clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN in turn helps keep the myriad other tissue and endocrine rhythms in synchrony, enabling health. The modern environment is highly disruptive to this internal synchrony. Light at night from cell phones or urban light pollution, and social impositions like school start times or rotating work shifts all act as “temporal pollution,” causing loss of internal synchrony. The more severe the desynchrony, the higher the risk for a broad range of diseases, including obesity, cancer, infertility, depression and ultimately cognitive decline. Without knowing how these systems normally maintain synchrony or which systems are normally synchronized, it is hard to understand what happens in desynchrony to degrade health. This problem is complicated by the fact that some biological systems have ultradian (every few hours) and infradian (every few days) cycles in addition to circadian cycles. The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) generates ultradian rhythms through negative feedback, but also shows a strong circadian cycle; the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG) shows the same negative feedback ultradian activity, circadian rhythmicity, and also infradian rhythms of ovulation and spermatogenesis. These two axes are regulated by the SCN. Recent work indicates that there is cross-talk between these axes, and that their hormonal outputs - corticosterone, and estradiol (in females) and testosterone (in males), respectively – work to synchronize extra-SCN tissues and behavioral rhythms of feeding and drinking (FaD). Finally, the SCN, HPA, and HPG axes all affect core body temperature (CBT), so that high temporal resolution recordings of CBT contain information about the cycling and synchrony of these systems across time scales.  There are three aims to this proposal, using rats as a model system: 1) Test at high temporal resolution the effects of changes to the HPA axis, HPG axis, and SCN on CBT. 2) Use these relationships to build a model that can back-predict the state of the HPA axis, HPG axis, and SCN from a high temporal resolution CBT record of a given individual. 3) Expose rats to environmental temporal disruption in the form of a 6 h “jetlag” phase advance of the light cycle, and use the model to predict the response across these systems at 1-minute temporal resolution. This work will employ within-animal comparisons before and after surgical and pharmacological manipulations of rats whose FaD, activity, and CBT are captured continuously at 1-minute resolution. These data will be analyzed using signal-processing and machine learning to define patterns and relationships. The resulting model will allow minimally-invasive exploration of environmental disruption across physiological systems in real time. The model will be used to quantify synchrony as it is disrupted and re-emerges, identifying markers for risk or resilience, and generating hypotheses for future work into preventive strategies and treatments. Project Narrative. Artificial lights and social obligation cause people living with modern infrastructure to suffer a loss of synchrony across their organs, which evolved to track the stable day and year light cycles. We know about internal synchrony mostly by the diseases that arise from its loss – everything from cancer to obesity, depression, and infertility. This work will develop a system for tracking the cycles of many body-systems at the same time with minute-to-minute accuracy, allowing rapid detection of desynchrony, and a potential way to study how synchrony works normally, and why its disruption by the modern environment causes disease.",Understanding the impact of environmental disruption in biological timing systems through signal processing.,9567170,K99ES027509,"['Address', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Body Temperature', 'Body Temperature Changes', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Corticosterone', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dysmenorrhea', 'Dyspepsia', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Environment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Estradiol', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormonal Change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Jet Lag Syndrome', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Orphan', 'Output', 'Ovulation', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System', 'Planet Earth', 'Pollution', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Rattus', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Obligations', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'body system', 'comparative', 'drinking', 'feeding', 'high risk', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'minimally invasive', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid detection', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'response', 'shift work', 'signal processing', 'social', 'suprachiasmatic nucleus', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'time use']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2018,104094,-0.015860407062235963
"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features. The Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) will enable clinical staff with only minimal training to cost effectively implement General Movement Assessment (GMA) for Cramped Synchronous General Movements (CSGMs), with interpretive reporting performed automatically.

"Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the “Alcoa Study” remains the development of increasingly rich models to explain the disparate health and work-capacity trajectories demonstrated in this universally insured, geographically, socially and economically diverse cohort of 200,000+ men and women as they progress from work-life into retirement. Outcomes of focus remain incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to 1) early life social context via Census data; 2) personal and family work experience and income across the life span via IRS and SSA; 3) post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI) and 4) contextual social environment from lifetime residential geocoding. Consequently, we propose in the next cycle to embrace a life course approach to study the social, environmental and behavioral determinants of the outcomes listed above The specific aims of this grant are: Aim 1: Link Alcoa workers to individual census records to examine how early life environment influences later life health outcomes; Aim 2: Assess the impact on health and function of adverse working environment as it accrues during work-life, with an emphasis on ubiquitous physical hazards; Aim 3: Identify antecedents of short-term and long-term disability across working life as candidates for subsequent hypothesis testing; Aim 4: Assess the impact disability benefits have on employee work function and health; Aim 5: Examine how injuries and health shocks affect retirement savings and subsequent health trajectories; Aim 6: To address generalizability across studies and populations, compare the Alcoa population to relevant complementary datasets, administrative and survey. Viewed altogether, continuation of the Alcoa study with the assembled team of investigators provides an unparalleled opportunity to address a host of critical empiric and methodologic issues previously unapproachable. In addition to understanding better which occupational exposures contribute to chronic disease and disability, these data will allow us to control for economic and other contextual factors to an extraordinary degree. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Alcoa research infrastructure—linking quantitative exposure measures to myriad hazards of active workers whose behavior, social environment and health status from pre-employment through retirement to death are fully observed—provides a unique opportunity to extend our work on the outcomes of focus including incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to early life social context, personal and family work experience and income and post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI).","Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce",9534496,R01AG026291,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Disability Insurance', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Occupational Health', 'Outcome', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Price', 'Privatization', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Shock', 'Social Environment', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disability impact', 'experience', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'study population', 'uptake']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,715709,-0.0355640497419798
"Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions ABSTRACT Bullying is a preventable public health problem that can have long-lasting health, academic and social consequences. Bullying affects between 18% and 31% of adolescents and has been associated with serious negative consequences including depression, substance use, and academic failure for both the perpetrator and target. Over the past decade, bullying behavior has expanded into the digital realm and is known as cyberbullying. Cyberbullying stories have had frequent coverage by news organizations, including coverage of teens whose death from suicide was attributed to cyberbullying. Previous work illustrates the influence of news stories on individual’s attitudes and experiences. News organization coverage has been influential to readers in areas such as suicide, infectious disease outbreaks such as H1N1 flu, and tobacco use. Little is known whether and how adolescents and their families perceive or utilize news coverage of bullying or cyberbullying. News media may be an untapped resource to promote bullying prevention messages and strategies. Our long- term goal is to develop and test interventions to improve bullying prevention and intervention efforts working with media. Towards that goal, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news organization coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families. First, we will evaluate youth and parent perspectives on lay media coverage of bullying using qualitative interviews with 50 participants: 25 diverse adolescents age 15-18 years and 25 parent/guardians of these adolescents. Second, we will assess the current state of the narrative in news media coverage of bullying. We will identify a sample of 500 news articles from print/online media that cover bullying over the past 5 years and conduct content analysis using natural language processing. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software we will evaluate the proportion of words that represent fear-based reporting such as alarmist words (e.g. epidemic, tragic), as well as words that represent public health-oriented messages such as prevention. We will also compare news coverage of bullying to cyberbullying. After analyzing data from these two aims, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 journalists. Our third aim is to synthesize these findings and identify strategies for future interventions that are feasible and acceptable to journalists. We will work with 3 consultants from the fields of communication and journalism to identify and engage journalists (n=30) in qualitative interviews. When these interconnected study aims are successfully completed, outcomes will include a comprehensive understanding of how adolescents and their parents understand and utilize news coverage of bullying, the current state of bullying and cyberbullying news coverage narrative, and perspectives of journalists on intervention approaches that are feasible and acceptable. We will utilize these findings towards novel intervention approaches, such as to leverage news coverage towards enhancing prevention of bullying. PROJECT NARRATIVE Previous studies have shown that news media coverage of health issues can change attitudes and behaviors; for example, journalists’ approach to suicide can have significant impact on bereaved families and at-risk youth. News media can also complement public health efforts, such as through coverage of tobacco harms that have been shown to prevent smoking among adolescents. Bullying is a significant public health issues that can lead to short and long-term health effects and is frequently covered by news media; thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families towards developing future interventions.",Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions,9551054,R21HD090221,"['Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemic', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Priorities', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Influentials', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Journalism', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoking', 'Suicide', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'bullying', 'bullying prevention', 'contagion', 'cyberbullying', 'digital', 'experience', 'flu', 'health organization', 'improved', 'news', 'novel', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'sexual minority', 'social', 'social stigma', 'success', 'suicidal morbidity']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2018,184819,-0.04334787576735049
"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,9547897,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Imagery', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Regimen', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'distraction', 'evidence base', 'haptics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'training opportunity', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,317404,-0.012337664829312207
"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9545867,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2018,117680,-0.010733440330279611
"Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes ABSTRACT Patterns (e.g. frequency, amount, etc.) of dietary intake and daily physical activity have each been independently linked with an increasing prevalence of obesity. Yet, connecting these patterns to obesity and chronic disease through the integration of time has not been previously considered. Given the strong evidence for independent linkages between each of these patterns and obesity, there is a critical need to determine the potential synergistic correlation of these patterns of behavior within the framework of a relationship with health. In the absence of such insights, opportunities for early detection of behavioral patterns that predispose obesity and chronic disease will be missed, and our long-term research goal to create these early detection strategies will not be met. The central hypothesis of this project is based on the analytical framework and methodology that was previously developed by the investigators: that daily patterns of energy intake, when integrated with physical activity, will be associated with health in a representative sample of U.S. adults 20 to 65 y (NHANES 2003-2006). The objectives in this R21 application include the development of data patterning methodology that can be used to create distinct dietary intake and physical activity patterns and then successfully integrate these patterns to identify population temporal pattern clusters. Next, the investigators will evaluate the cluster relationships with obesity and health outcomes and compare the integrated clusters to the un-integrated dietary and activity pattern clusters. The working hypotheses are firstly, that novel distance measures based on dynamic time warping for the dietary and physical activity data can be integrated to produce meaningful clustering related to health, and secondly, that a population cluster which exhibits a pattern of evenly spaced eating occasions, moderate energy consumption and moderate physical activity patterns in a 24 hour day will be associated with normal weight and without chronic disease, and that relationships with health outcomes will be stronger for the integrated temporal pattern clusters compared with un-integrated temporal dietary clusters and physical activity clusters. The rationale for this research is that its successful completion is expected to create data reduction methods that classify temporal lifestyle patterns linked to disease, further, the expectation is that these analytical techniques will integrate multidimensional temporal dietary and physical activity data. These outcomes are expected to have a significant positive impact, not only in developing/evaluating new analytic methods but in laying the groundwork for data based preventative interventions. This proposed research is potentially significant because results will provide a starting point for understanding the importance of the timing of dietary and physical activity patterns to the prevention of obesity and disease with potentially broad translational  RELEVANCE TO NIH The proposed research is relevant to public health because preventative time-based dietary and physical activity patterns will be identified among the US population, which are expected to open new research horizons for evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. The project is relevant to NIH's mission because individualized early detection of lifestyles supporting health or linked with disease may be attainable through the development of analytical techniques integrating multiple layers of data. Such strategies could be applied to utilize the increasing information from personal electronic monitoring devices and to detect patterns associated with positive and negative health outcomes.",Temporal Dietary and Physical Activity Patterns Related to Health Outcomes,9601212,R21CA224764,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Factors', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Energy Intake', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Exercise', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'expectation', 'health data', 'healthy lifestyle', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'modifiable behavior', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'prevent', 'speech processing', 'unhealthy lifestyle', 'waist circumference']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,195600,0.006349001516087275
"How Does Automated Record Linkage Affect Inferences about Population Health? ABSTRACT  Our broad research objective is to create the Longitudinal Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-dataset (LIFE-M) spanning the late 19th and 20th century United States. Using automated record linkage technology, the LIFE-M project combines millions of vital records to reconstruct how and why individuals' health has changed across time. This multi-generational, longitudinal micro-database aims to transform research on health and longevity, on childbearing and family structure, and on the long-run health effects of early-life circumstances and exposures.  In creating LIFE-M, however, we have encountered serious deficits in knowledge about the performance of automated record linkage technology. The proposed project seeks to evaluate the performance of the most popular and cutting-edge automated linking techniques for the purposes of creating longitudinal health data. Our specific aims are to (1) produce systematic evidence regarding the performance of automated record linking algorithms in terms of match rates, representativeness of the linked sample, erroneous matches (type I errors), and systematic measurement error; (2) examine how phonetic name-cleaning methods affect quality metrics; and (3) examine how record quality metrics vary for different underrepresented subgroups (including women, racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrants) and to determine how linking methods affect representativeness and inferences. To achieve these aims, we have developed new partnerships with record linking experts allowing us to incorporate the most cutting-edge methods in record linking. We will also rely on new “ground truth” generated by LIFE-M project's independent, double-blind human review process.  This project will contribute significantly to existing knowledge about the use of automated linking methods for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health data. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in health studies. Both contributions should greatly enhance the quality of descriptive and causal inferences about population health and aging and disparities in these outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by advancing record linking methodology for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health datasets. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in public health and aging studies using linked records.

"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Neighborhood Looking Glass: 360 Degree Automated Characterization of the Built Environment for Neighborhood Effects Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal represents a vertical advancement in neighborhood effects research, producing for the first time, national neighborhood indicators of the built environment. Thus far, only local studies have been conducted due to the resource-intensive nature of site visits to conduct assessments of community features and also manual annotations of street images. With the recent advancement of computer vision and the emergence of massive sources of image data, we will leverage our team’s abilities to develop a data collection strategy utilizing geographic information systems to assemble a national collection of Google Street View images of all road intersections and street segments in the United States. We will utilize this data bank, and develop informatics algorithms to produce neighborhood summaries of built environment that have been theoretically and empirically identified to be important for health outcomes. After the creation of Neighborhood Looking Glass, we will conduct investigations into the impact of neighborhood environments on health utilizing medical records from hundreds of thousands of patients and accounting for predisposing characteristics in analyses. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, computer vision, bioinformatics, and computer science—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Develop informatics techniques to produce neighborhood quality indicators; 2) Measure the accuracy of data algorithms and construct an interactive geoportal for neighborhood data visualization and data sharing, 3) Utilize Neighborhood Looking Glass and a large collection of medical records from Intermountain Healthcare to investigate neighborhood influences on the risk of obesity and substance abuse. The epidemic rise in chronic health conditions is recent and as such suggests its cause is social, cultural, and constructed rather than purely biological. Thus, we have the possibility of intervening on the environment to better support health. Recent studies suggest that the current cohort of young adults may face historically high cardiovascular disease risk and chronic disease burden. Our substantive investigation of the impact of neighborhood factors on chronic conditions will contribute further to the understanding of contextual influences on the health of this cohort at the forefront of a chronic disease epidemic. Moreover, the dramatic rise in overdoses, accidental poisonings, and mental health issues contributing to premature mortality warrants further investigation into risk-inducing environmental factors for substance abuse. Neighborhood Looking Glass will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of street image data to capture built environment characteristics. Results can be utilized to inform population-based strategies to reduce health disparities and improve health. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health The epidemic rise in obesity, related chronic diseases, and substance abuse in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. The development of the Neighborhood Looking Glass will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of street image data to capture built environment characteristics with potential impact on health.

Studies in high risk groups includes research to improve adherence to malaria case-management guidelines in pregnancy in western Kenya (1.2) and three large multi-centre trials including one on the prevention of rebound admissions and deaths with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in children with severe anaemia in Kenya (2.4) and two on the control of malaria in pregnancy: STOPMiP-Indonesia (2.6), STOPMIP2 in Kenya and Malawi (2.5) evaluating the safety and efficacy of intermittent preventive therapy with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Project Narrative The aim of the proposed collaboration is to improve the use of existing interventions and to explore new ways to reduce the burden of malaria in high risk groups such as young children and pregnant women. In addition it aims to explore the effect of different combinations of area-wide interventions to reduce malaria transmission and to evaluate surveillance tools that can measure the beneficial impact on populations in terms of health, household level wealth and quality of health service delivery. These are high priority objectives of the partner institutions in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia and align with the objective of CDC's Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria of the Center for Global Health to refine malaria interventions and develop new tools to stay ahead of the curve and ensure its global investments continue to be successful.",Institutional Research Collaboration between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Centers for Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,9692304,U01GH001646,[' '],CGH,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2018,100000,-0.011052813980574262
"Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health Symptoms in Youth ABSTRACT Only slightly more than half (55%) of 4-17 year olds with significant mental health difficulties receive treatment. These are often not initiated until issues are significantly impacting the child and family. Nearly half of children with known mental health disorders and up to 80% of children with sub-clinical symptoms receive no treatment. This study aims to (a) develop methods based on electronic medical records data to identify early mental health needs in children 4-17 years of age and (b) conduct a pragmatic randomized trial in two non-academic health care systems to test a mental health family navigator model to promote early access to, engagement in, and coordination of needed mental health services for children and adolescence. Phase 1 of the study would focus on the development and refinement of a natural language processing (NLP) tool to identify symptomatic 4-17 year olds with no diagnosed mental health disorder(s). The tool would identify patients with documentation of mental health symptoms or complaints in the free text of a progress note from a recent primary care or urgent care visit. Phase 2 of the study would focus on conducting a pragmatic randomized trial comparing intervention and usual care arm patients enrolled from Kaiser Permanente (KP) Washington and KP Northern California. The trial will enroll 200 patients per arm (n=400). The navigator model to be implemented and tested will include three groups based on recent visits recorded in the electronic health record. Those with: (1) a new mental health diagnosis; (2) new mental health medication ordered, no mental health diagnosis; (3) no new mental health diagnosis or medication (symptoms identified by NLP tool). The study intervention will offer 6 months of support to the family by a mental health navigator (social worker). The navigator will perform an initial needs and barriers assessment with the family around mental health services, conduct ongoing motivational interviewing around mental health care, provide up to 4 bridging psychotherapy sessions (when appropriate) via clinic-to-home video visits, help the family find and schedule with appropriate mental health providers in the community, reach out ad hoc if mental health appointments or medication refills are missed, stay in contact with the family for 6 months. The primary outcome is percentage of youth with at least 4 psychotherapy visits in the 6 months following the initial visit. The secondary outcome is the percentage of youth with >=80% medication adherence over the 6 month follow up period. We hypothesize that the intervention arm will have higher rates of psychotherapy use and medication adherence compared to the control arm. We will also assess medication adjustments, initiation of psychotherapy or medications, and (intervention arm only) change in self-efficacy in navigating the mental health care system over 6 months. All primary analyses will follow an intent-to-treat approach. A waiver of consent will be obtained to include data for all individuals offered the intervention in the analysis, regardless of the amount of intervention (“dose” of navigation) received. NARRATIVE Mental illnesses often first appear in childhood and adolescence yet go mostly untreated until a serious disorder develops. This study will (a) develop ways to identify early mental health needs in children 4-17 years of age using free text notes entered into medical records, and (b) carry out a two-arm randomized trial to test if offering social worker support and video-based psychotherapy result in more mental health visits over a 6 month period of time.",Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health Symptoms in Youth,9752077,R56MH117767,"['17 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Appointment', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social Workers', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Videoconferencing', 'Visit', 'Wait Time', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'arm', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'burden of illness', 'care providers', 'child mental health service', 'electronic registry', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'outreach', 'peer', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'pragmatic trial', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'secondary outcome', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment services', 'trial comparing', 'trial design', 'urgent care', 'usual care arm', 'waiver']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R56,2018,741297,-0.014376212016886766
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9568354,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2018,58654,-0.05501101987414363
"Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population Project Summary This project will enhance and develop the only source of data that provides core information about work, education, income, and migration for the entire U.S. population. This unique resource allows us to observe today's late-life population when they were young. This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. Narrative This project will develop data for prospective analysis of the impact of early-life circumstances and environment on health outcomes in late life, including Alzheimer's disease. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years.

"Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders PROJECT SUMMARY Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a leading cause of injury and psychological distress among middle school-aged adolescents, and occurs at higher rates in youth exposed to harsh parenting. Tradi- tional intervention programs that target those at risk for perpetrating aggression due to harsh parenting have had only limited success. This lack of success may be due to the fact that aggression is the product of complex decision-making processes that are influenced by current states of attention, arousal, and affect. A different approach is to prevent aggression before it happens by interceding when nonverbal indices signal a shift in these critical states. An essential first step towards establishing this prevention-based approach is to isolate nonverbal behavior that reliably predicts forthcoming aggression in high-risk adolescents. Eye gaze, pupillary dilation, and facial expressions are strong nonverbal behavioral candidates given that they are well-established indices of attention, arousal, and affective states. The current proposal uses computational modeling to test the predictive link between these nonverbal behaviors elicited during an ecologically valid social rejection paradigm and subsequent expression of peer-based aggression in adolescents (11-14 years; N=80) with high and low exposure to harsh parenting. Results will lay the groundwork for our long-term objective, to develop next gen- eration interventions aimed at preventing aggression the moment its behavioral precursors are detected. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a costly public health problem that is inadequately addressed by existing interventions. The goal of this project is to implement computational modeling to predict aggression in low and high-risk youth using nonverbal behavior elicited during social rejection and aggression- related decision-making. Next generation interventions can then be designed to prevent aggression when these nonverbal indices are detected.",Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders,9791513,R21HD093912,"['14 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Anger', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eyelid structure', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical aggression', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Testing', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aggression prevention', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'boys', 'bullying', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'high risk', 'high-risk adolescents', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'junior high school', 'male', 'next generation', 'novel', 'peer', 'physical model', 'predictive test', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'success', 'virtual']",NICHD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R21,2018,232781,-0.026832418830955666
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9442751,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2018,673206,0.0021632436928388675
"Infrared Eyes(iREyes) Infrared Eyes Abstract Eden Medical, Inc. is pleased to resubmit this Phase 2 SBIR proposal to develop the “Infrared Eyes” (iREyes) imager system, an affordable and powerful mobile health (mHealth) tool for healthcare. The hand-held iREyes system will acquire both thermal and visible spectrum imagery to quantify healing via thermal indexing methodology. The iREyes will offer a user-friendly product with automated categorization. Diabetic foot wounds are common, complex and costly. Foot areas that are likely to ulcerate are associated with increased local skin temperature due to inflammation and enzymatic autolysis of tissue. Inflammation is characterized by the cardinal signs including redness, swelling, and heat. In addition to identifying inflammation associated with healing, the iREyes will also identify hot spots associated with repetitive stress to reduce ulceration and re-ulceration risk for people in diabetic foot remission. The iREyes will directly quantify inflammation pathophysiology implementing a powerful revised two-part strategy: wound healing via regional foot index analysis and ulcer reoccurrence risk through temperature asymmetry threshold analysis. The combined thermal indexing for healing existing wounds and asymmetry predictive analysis represents a significant breakthrough over current practice.

"Monitoring and Stabilizing Behavioral Rhythms to Improve Mental Health Abstract: HealthRhythms, Inc. Substantial evidence supports the idea that disruptions in the regularity of behavioral routines (or ‘social rhythms’) can lead to the onset of psychiatric symptoms and full blown episodes via their impact on endogenous circadian rhythms and, conversely that stable social routines protect against new mood episodes. Based on our conviction that monitoring, evaluating, and increasing the regularity of behavioral rhythms has broad applicability for improving mental health, we established HealthRhythms, Inc. (www.healthrhythms.com) with the goal of using mobile technology to add the layer of mental health care to all of healthcare. Our product model capitalizes on the ubiquity and intimacy of smartphones and their capacity to sense parameters of behavior that represent key indicators of mental health on a 24/7 basis captured in the user’s natural environment, opposed to the sporadic, in-clinic measurement that has characterized mental healthcare to date. The product we envision will ultimately have three pillars: Rhythm Sensing, Rhythm Trending, and Rhythm Stabilization. The first two of these pillars have been developed and thousands of licenses for our product have already been sold. Building on our accomplishments to date, this SBIR Phase II Direct proposal extends our work in three ways: 1) further validating our existing technology, 2) developing the next stage of our technology and 3) expanding and improving our prediction models and demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of our technology. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Enhance our Rhythm Trending capabilities through intensive examination and analysis of data from the 3,000+ patients with whom our product has already been deployed. Aim 2: Develop the envisioned Rhythm Stabilization pillar of our technology. Aim 3: Expand the nature of the data included in our prediction models and demonstrate their utility.

"Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary This National Research Service Award (F32) is designed to promote the development of Stephanie Goldstein as an independent, clinical research scientist focused on developing and evaluating strategies for measuring and intervening on health behaviors that capitalize on digital health technology. Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and health benefits for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes and most experience gradual weight regain, thus negating the benefits over time. Lapses (i.e., self- reported eating instances that deviate from the BOT prescribed diet) could explain poor outcomes, but the behavior is understudied because it is difficult to assess in-lab and via self-report. We therefore propose to study lapses using a multimethod approach with the following tools: ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device), a wrist-worn device that automatically detects eating behavior and various eating characteristics (frequency, rate, and duration of eating episodes), and 24-hour dietary recalls. We will recruit participants (n=40) with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor to enroll in a 12-week BOT program and follow them through an additional 12-week period of weight loss maintenance. Participants will complete a biweekly 7-day EMA protocol to self-report on eating behavior, including the occurrence of dietary lapse. Participants will continuously wear the wrist-worn ActiGraph Link to characterize eating behavior. Lastly, participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls via structured interview (split between days with and without lapses) at 6-week intervals to measure the composition of all food and beverages consumed. The proposed study approach is consistent with priorities of NHLBI to optimize clinical research and diagnostic strategies to improve CVD and related risk factors. This project will be conducted in combination with an individualized training program including a curriculum designed to facilitate the acquisition of key skills and experience to move the applicant towards her career goals. This includes didactic and experiential training related to the use of passive sensing technology and related analytic strategies in research, factors that can impede weight maintenance and dietary adherence in BOT, and administration and interpretation of validated nutritional assessment. The applicant will work closely with her primary sponsor, Dr. J. Graham Thomas, her co-sponsors Dr. Rena Wing (renowned expert in weight maintenance), Dr. Adam Hoover (electrical and computer scientist), and Dr. Whitney Evans (nutritional epidemiologist and registered dietician). This mentorship team, in combination with the infrastructure and resources available through the Miriam Hospital Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center and Alpert Brown Medical School, represent the ideal environment to accomplish the applicant's training goals, foster professional development and increase the applicant's autonomy as an independent clinical obesity researcher. Project Narrative The current project is evaluating the utility of a wrist-worn passive sensing device for detecting dietary lapses (i.e., discrete eating instances that deviate from a prescribed diet) and evaluating the behavior's association with weight loss outcomes. Participants, with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor, will wear wrist-worn devices, complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device) on dietary lapses, and provide information on dietary composition via semi-regular 24-hour food recalls throughout the duration of a 12-week behavioral weight loss program and 12-week weight maintenance period. This study aims to 1) identifying characteristics of lapse behavior by measuring passively-sensed timing, duration, frequency, and rate of eating amongst known lapse episodes, 2) test the association between dietary lapse frequency and weight change, and 3) estimate nutrition composition of dietary lapses.",Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9609565,F32HL143954,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Beverages', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary intake', 'Dietetics', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Energy Intake', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Healthy Eating', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Wing', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'falls', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity treatment', 'prevent', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment program', 'weight loss program', 'weight maintenance', 'willingness']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,F32,2018,58282,-0.03327374798027443
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,9470566,R01MH114028,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Paraphilias', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'aggression prevention', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data structure', 'early childhood', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'mental state', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'pediatric trauma', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2018,754642,-0.016265089435853915
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9514218,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,182298,-0.0014970321830391502
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9536156,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2018,563079,-0.023927017851148636
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9487760,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,1272933,-0.04695202770140751
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal responds to RFA-MH-17-612, “Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34).” We have shown in several randomized trials that family-focused therapy (FFT) for symptomatic youth at high-risk for bipolar disorder - consisting of psychoeducation and family communication and problem solving skills training - is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in hastening symptomatic recovery. However, between 50%-60% of high-risk youth still have residual mood symptoms and functional impairment after 18 weeks of FFT. In our prior studies, two constructs have emerged as predictors of lack of response to treatment: mood instability in the child and expressed emotion (EE) in parents (i.e., frequent critical comments or hostility). In adolescents (ages 12-18) with a parent with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, we hypothesize that augmenting FFT with frequent and targeted interventions in the home setting through a Smartphone app (MyCoachConnect, or MCC) will (a) have a greater and more rapid impact than standard FFT on the targeted mechanisms of mood instability in adolescents and EE in parents, and (b) as a result, enhance symptom resolution and functioning in adolescents. To be eligible, adolescents must score high on parent-rated measures of mood instability, and have at least one parent who is high-EE by speech sample coding criteria. The MCC app will record weekly open speech samples from parents and children and daily and weekly mood ratings from adolescents. The app assessments will be fed back to the FFT clinician, who will use this information to “push” recommendations for mood regulation, communication, and problem-solving strategies (linked to the FFT modules) for parents and youth. In year 1, we will conduct an open trial (n=25) to determine (a) the feasibility and acceptability of FFT with mobile coaching (FFT-MCC), as given by clinicians in community settings, and (b) associations between online/speech feature proxies of the targets (mood instability and EE as measured weekly by MCC) and standard measures of the targets. In years 2 and 3 we will conduct a 75- case RCT in which families are assigned to FFT with MCC skills coaching, FFT with MCC assessments only, with no coaching; or FFT Only, without MCC. We hypothesize that FFT-MCC will be acceptable to parents, adolescents and clinicians, and more effective than FFT without MCC coaching or FFT-Only in engaging the targets of mood instability and EE and promoting improvements in adolescents' mood symptoms and quality of life over 27 weeks. The study will facilitate the translation of a technological augmentation to an evidence-based family intervention, with the goal of increasing treatment access among families with mood disorders. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a 12-session evidence- based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC “real time” assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills. We hypothesize that the augmented version of FFT (FFT-MCC) will be more effective than FFT without coaching/informational alerts in altering treatment targets and in stabilizing youths' mood symptoms and quality of life.",Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders,9587465,R34MH117200,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Back', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Family', 'Family Relationship', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Hostility', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'community setting', 'effectiveness trial', 'emerging adult', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'girls', 'high risk', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'mobile application', 'mood regulation', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'psychoeducation', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'skills training', 'smartphone Application', 'standard measure', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy design', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'usability', 'volunteer']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R34,2018,195000,-0.026322155048244165
"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,9505946,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,387714,-0.019041114909115944
"Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health PROJECT SUMMARY Nearly 10% of Americans practice meditation to improve health. Randomized controlled trials support this practice and show that mindfulness training is effective in improving a broad range of health outcomes. In particular, mindfulness training has been shown to reduce biomarkers of systemic inflammation that contribute to the pathophysiology of disease and predict risk for all-cause mortality. Still, little is known about the biological processes linking mindfulness training with inflammation. This proposal tests the hypothesis that mindfulness training aids the regulation of inflammation by mitigating glucocorticoid resistance (GCR). GCR is a leading candidate mechanism linking psychosocial threat with systemic inflammation. Whereas cortisol released in response to threat normally binds to glucocorticoid receptors and down-regulates inflammation, chronic perceptions of threat lead to a state of GCR, in which glucocorticoid receptors become insensitive to the anti-inflammatory effects of circulating cortisol. Mindfulness training is proposed to diminish perceptions of threat in ways that restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. To test this biological pathway, this study assesses functional GCR and biomarkers of inflammation before and after a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or control Health Enhancement Program (HEP) in a sample of lonely older adults (N=188). Loneliness is a form of chronic psychosocial threat, and is consistently associated with GCR and systemic inflammation, yet MBSR is one of very few interventions successful in reducing loneliness. MBSR is expected to decrease GCR (and restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity) compared to HEP from pre- to post- intervention. Moreover, these decreases in GCR are expected to mediate the effects of MBSR (vs. HEP) on lowering systemic inflammation (CRP and IL-6) from pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up. In sum, this proposal investigates decreased GCR as a biological mechanism through which mindfulness training reduces inflammatory disease risk. It addresses NCCIH's call for research on understanding the biological mechanisms of action underlying mind-body intervention approaches and complements NCCIH's special interest in alleviating inflammatory processes. The knowledge gained from this research will contribute to a better understanding of the basic biological pathways underlying mindfulness practices, which may help to identify and target populations likely to benefit from mindfulness training. The research and training plan described in this application provide opportunities for the applicant to develop a knowledge base and methodology in psychoneuroimmunology, learn statistical techniques for analyzing complex mechanistic pathways, and develop the professional skills necessary for a successful career testing biological and psychological mechanisms underlying mind-body interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mindfulness meditation practices are widely used to alleviate physical symptoms, and growing evidence suggests that mindfulness training may reduce systemic inflammation, but less is known about the biological pathways linking mindfulness training with inflammatory processes. The proposed project investigates a biological mechanism, glucocorticoid sensitivity, to explain how mindfulness training lowers inflammation among lonely older adults who are at risk for multiple inflammatory diseases. From a public health perspective, clarifying this mechanistic pathway will help to identify who is likely to show health benefits from mindfulness training.",Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health,9561883,F32AT009508,"['Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood Circulation', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Dexamethasone', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Feeling', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Immune', 'Immunology procedure', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meditation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Mind-Body Intervention', 'Mindfulness Training', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychoneuroimmunology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy trial', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'falls', 'feasibility trial', 'follow-up', 'health training', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mindfulness meditation', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'physical symptom', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'receptor function', 'receptor sensitivity', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'successful intervention', 'training aid', 'training opportunity']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2018,63154,-0.034991119792995067
"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",9505972,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular Abnormalities', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'exercise intolerance', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,1319272,-0.01996860823493075
"A Direct Reading Video Assessment Instrument for Repetitive Motion Stress Project Summary/ Abstract This research studies if computer vision can more effectively evaluate worker exposure and assess the associated risk for work related injuries than conventional methods. Current methods involve either observations or measurements using instruments attached to a worker's hands or arms. Observation is often considered too subjective or inaccurate, and instruments too invasive or time consuming for routine applications in industry. Automated job analysis potentially offers a more objective, accurate, repeatable, and efficient exposure assessment tool than observational analysis. Computer vision uses less resources than instruments attached to workers and does not interfere with production; can quantify more exposure variables and interactions; is suitable for long-term, direct reading exposure assessment; and offers animated data visualizations synchronized with video for identifying aspects of jobs needing interventions. This research leverages the research from coordinated multi-institutional prospective studies of upper limb work related MSD conducted between 2001 and 2010 that studied production and service workers from a variety of US industries, and used rigorous case-criteria and individual-level exposure assessments prospectively, including recording detailed videos of the work. Our study partners from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Washington State Labor & Industries Safety & Health Assessment & Research for Prevention program and the University of California-San Francisco will provide task-level videos, associated exposure variable data, and prospective health outcomes for 1,649 workers. Exposure properties directly measured from videos of jobs and corresponding health outcomes from the prospective study database will establish dose-response relationships to translate into a prototype automated job analysis instrument. We build on our previous success in developing video marker-less hand motion algorithms for estimating the ACGIH hand activity level, and reliable video processing methods for hand tracking under challenging viewing conditions. This proposal will refine and develop additional video algorithms, and analyze the videos to extract exposure measures for repetition, posture, exertions, and their interactions. The video extracted exposure measures will be compared against conventional observational exposure measures made by our collaborators. Video and corresponding observational data will be merged with the prospective health outcomes data to evaluate dose-response and to develop and validate parsimonious exposure risk models for an automated direct reading repetitive motion instrument. We will test if automation has better predictive capability than observation and also consider the accuracy and utility of computer vision analysis against conventional job analysis for selected industrial jobs.

"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9526512,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2018,129737,-0.005093232519546422
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis,9505230,K23MH116130,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Israel', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'economic cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal course', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'responsible research conduct', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIMH,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2018,191000,0.00023161027222236714
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Development and feasibility of prevention-minded oral health mobile App based on dietary selections and oral hygiene events. The number of decayed and filled tooth surfaces in primary dentition is on the rise in US children between the ages of 2 and 11 years old; in fact, 60% of adolescents (between 12 and 19 years old) and 9 out of 10 dentate seniors (age 65+) bear evidence of dental caries. Reinforced with a 2011-12 report stating 91% of those between the ages of 20 and 64 have dental caries, virtually all walks of life are thus affected – and this doesn’t even include those unreported, or those with significant dental erosion or gingival recession. Thus, these statistics could imply there is a significant unmet need in creating improved mechanisms for healthier dietary and hygienic habits. One way to achieve healthier habits and behavior is through effective communication. However, disconnects exist between oral health messaging and the patient’s understanding of clinical recommendations: in fact, oral health organizations recognize the need to improve and empower the public’s oral health literacy. Although adherence to preventive plans are critical to thwarting tooth decay, a patient’s poor oral health understanding and knowledge, even after a dental visit, persistently introduce factors that diminish preventive efforts and favorable oral health outcomes: for example, a clinical report revealed the average patient only recounts about half of the recommended dental advice. Oral health literacy is a relatively new area of research and there are few innovations in this space. Therefore, opportunities that address oral health illiteracy and behavioral barriers utilizing today’s 21st century technology may promote better oral health outcomes. Such approaches are already well-under way for systemic health, but thus far, prevention-minded oral health measures are lacking. We believe a unique approach exists that utilizes something most people, both young and old, access on a daily basis: a mobile device. Our approach is underlined by recent statistics released by the Pew Center: more than 8 out of 10 U.S. adults access mobile devices for information, including more than 67% of seniors (65+ years of age). Utilizing our proven strengths and successes in preventive dentistry innovations and mobile application (App) development, in this Phase I proposal we will determine feasibility of creating a prototype oral health App that scores dietary and oral hygiene events utilizing algorithms devised from libraries of empirical nutritional and scientific data (laboratory and clinical). In doing so, this Phase I proposal has three Specific Aims: empirical nutritional and scientific data mining; multi-tiered decision tree algorithm construction with putative scoring index based on Aim #1 data; and, development of a prototype mobile App based on Aims #1 and #2. If successful and with clinical testing expected in a Phase II proposal, the long-term goal of this research is to deploy and commercialize an oral health App that promotes clinically effective oral health behavior. The constant feed from mined data libraries and social-engineering aspects are expected to drive routine use of the App, thus engaging the user towards favorable habits and healthier outcomes.

"Place-level discrimination and birth outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability. In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination partially contributes to this disparity. Most of research on discrimination and birth outcomes relies on self-reported experiences of discrimination, and there have been few studies examining discrimination at the U.S. national level. Social contexts in which greater hostility towards minorities is manifested may cause psychological stress and increase risk of adverse birth outcomes. The scientific objective of this research plan is to develop a new county-level indicator of discriminatory attitudes from social media data as well as make use hate crimes data and measures of explicit and implicit racial bias to provide a detailed and nuanced investigation of the impact of discrimination on birth outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities in birth outcomes. Another strength of this research plan is the longitudinal study design with multiple years of data for both measures of discrimination and birth outcomes, which allows us to control for temporal trends and stable characteristics of the counties. Furthermore, the influence of discrimination on birth outcomes may begin prior to pregnancy. There is increasing recognition of maternal health prior to conception influencing fetal development and birth outcomes. The project will empirically evaluate whether place-level discrimination is associated with biomarkers of chronic stress among young women of child-bearing age. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in: 1) developing expertise in Big Data, 2) measurement of discrimination, and 3) stress physiology and birth outcomes. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career evaluating how discrimination impact minority health and health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability. In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination partially contributes to this disparity.

"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations. With this study we propose to adapt a wildly popular method used in computer vision applications, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and develop flexible extensions for many epidemiologic settings.

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images.

"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,9519046,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention cost', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'learning strategy', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'societal costs', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2018,620198,-0.00017196814298463248
"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9290961,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2017,441204,0.001516153445174404
"Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating Poor eating habits, particularly low fruit and vegetable intake, is a growing, serious public health concern, particularly among young adults age 21-30, referred to as Generation Y (GenY). GenY's poor dietary practices are associated with the onset of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, as well as declines in predicted health status and life expectancy. Thus, there is a need to develop effective interventions to improve GenY's eating habits. MENU GenY is a computer-based intervention to encourage increased fruit and vegetable intake among GenY. A critical component of MENU GenY is personalized eCoaching. eCoaches use email to deliver motivation-enhancing coaching to encourage healthy eating, grounded in the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based communication technique to increase intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change. The MI model posits that counselor's use of “MI-consistent” communication techniques are responsible for eliciting behavior change through patient “change talk” (i.e., statements about one's own desire, ability, reasons, need for or commitment to behavior change). A growing body of empirical evidence links change talk to behavior change, but research identifying the specific provider behaviors that elicit patient change talk is limited to specific populations (mainly adults who abuse substances and a couple studies of adolescents). Identifying specific communication strategies linked to behavior change and integrating these strategies into communication-based interventions (e.g., brief, motivation-enhancing interventions delivered in a variety of settings or public health initiatives) can increase these interventions' potency. However, a significant barrier to this research is the qualitative methods traditionally used to analyze the communication process which are resource-intensive, requiring an iterative process of human (subjective) interpretation of text. Rapidly developing computational technologies, specifically machine learning combined with classification models, offer a unique opportunity to accelerate this process. Our research group has recently applied machine learning-based data mining models to similar communication data. We automated a simple communication code scheme to characterize patient communication and achieved accuracy comparable to human coders. The goals of this study are to leverage innovative computer science machine learning and classification models to fully automate the communication coding process and link patterns in eCoach-patient communication to increases in fruit and vegetable intake. We propose a secondary analysis of data collected for a NICHD randomized clinical trial (R01 HD067314). The sample is 160 members of GenY drawn from both urban and rural settings (Detroit metropolitan area and rural Pennsylvania) with outcomes measured at baseline and 3 months. Our validated approach will accelerate the pace of outcomes-oriented communication research and identify effective communication strategies linked to healthy eating. These findings will be used to tailor interventions and public health messages and develop automated eCoaching. This research will use cutting edge computer science technology – machine learning-based classification models – to automate communication coding, a resource-intensive qualitative analysis process, and identify key communication strategies used by eCoaches linked to increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake among young adults age 21-30. Identifying communication strategies linked to increased FV intake will identify empirically derived communication techniques that can be used to tailor interventions and health promotion messages to more effectively promote behavior change in this age group. The development of this computer science technology is the first step toward automating the eCoaching process.",Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating,9336295,R21DK108071,"['21 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communication Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Practices', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Mail', 'Food', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Future Generations', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthy Eating', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Investigator-Initiated Research', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoking', 'Social Work', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive task', 'communication behavior', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'digital', 'effective intervention', 'emerging adulthood', 'evidence base', 'fruits and vegetables', 'good diet', 'improved', 'inner city', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intrinsic motivation', 'member', 'metropolitan', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'new technology', 'point of care', 'primary outcome', 'public health intervention', 'rural setting', 'satisfaction', 'secondary analysis', 'sugar', 'sweetened beverage', 'urban setting', 'young adult']",NIDDK,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,187184,-0.010874698418838593
"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course.

"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9279027,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'CCL26 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Standardization', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'illness length', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,156324,-0.016794500334877237
"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,9361299,R01HD092331,"['Academia', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Crime', 'Criminology', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Family', 'Firearms', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Security', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'behavioral outcome', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'convict', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'developmental psychology', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'repeat offender', 'social', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2017,706183,-0.005300488734580428
"Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses multiple priorities of PAR-12-197 ""Improving Diet and Physical Activity (PA) Assessment"" by advancing assessment of population PA in common settings. Physical inactivity is responsible for ≈200,000 deaths in the US and 5 million deaths worldwide annually. About 10% of breast and 10% of colon cancers are attributable to insufficient PA, and inactivity causes 9% of total premature mortality. Parks, schools and youth sports are important contributors of PA that are relevant to a majority of the population. Supporting PA in these settings would contribute to improvements in population levels of PA and disease prevention and control. We will develop a novel video analysis software system, named E-VIP (Ecological Video Identification of PA), which will estimate the number of people and aggregated volume of PA from video recordings of PA- relevant settings. E-VIP will provide automated and continuous (rather than momentary) assessment, which will allow ongoing feedback to inform adaptive interventions and decision making. E-VIP is based on computer science methods used to count crowds and identify behaviors. We will train the E-VIP machine learning algorithm on 32,400 seconds of video from 2 parks, 2 schools, and 2 youth sports settings. Participants will engage in a variety of activities while wearing accelerometers to capture PA intensity in Metabolic Equivalents (METs). The testing phase involves capturing 900, 5-minute videos of free-living behavior across 4 parks, 4 schools, and 4 youth sports settings, with half of the settings/zones being the same as from the training phase. A range of activities and density of people will be captured in both the training and testing phase to maximize coverage of more-difficult high-density situations. Systematic direct observation will be conducted on each time sample to provide the criterion measure for testing validity. The metrics that will be tested include the average number of people, average proportion of people in each activity category (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous), and sum PA MET-minutes in the setting over the 5-minute (or any given) time period. A gender and age group classifier will be explored. PE classes taught by PE specialists vs classroom teachers will be compared to test construct validity of E-VIP. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees, shadows, other people) will be assessed using moderator analyses. By automating ecological PA assessment, E-VIP will be feasible for widespread use. E-VIP's capability of continuous assessment will improve precision by collecting higher resolution data than collected by existing direct observation tools. When embedded in specific settings through commonly-used security cameras or webcams, or by purposefully placing video recorders, E-VIP will be capable of ongoing assessment which will inform public health surveillance, intervention, and evidence-based decision making (e.g., optimizing intervention strategies, monitoring school Physical Education mandates, providing needs assessment prior to and evaluation after environmental modifications). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop and test a software for automated ongoing measurement of use and physical activity intensity from video recordings in specific settings such as parks, schools (including Physical Education), and youth sports. This innovative software will support adaptive multilevel interventions and evidence-based decision making in physical activity-relevant settings to optimize strategies for improving population health.",Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software,9210068,R21CA194492,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physical Education', 'Physical Education and Training', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Premature Mortality', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Security', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Sports', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'population health', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary', 'software systems', 'teacher', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,"CHILDREN'S MERCY HOSP (KANSAS CITY, MO)",R21,2017,152937,0.0035962326281666884
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This large-scale study will advance the field by studying these different outcomes at their most basic functional level, and by identifying the biological mechanisms through which these specific types of distress and dysfunction develop.",Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes,9357691,U01MH110925,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Department evaluation', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychophysics', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'biobehavior', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'molecular marker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'response', 'success', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2017,4969685,-0.029619085310614534
"Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) includes serious threats to maternal health and survival that occur at delivery or postpartum. SMM, which includes postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, sepsis, and other serious conditions, can be life-threatening and have long-term effects on a woman’s health as well as adversely impact her infant’s health and well-being. Over the past 15 years, the prevalence of SMM has doubled in the U.S., currently affecting more than 65,000 women each year. Additionally, the prevalence of SMM is highest in women of minority races and ethnicities, particularly women who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. However, the most important risk factors for SMM are not established and it is unknown what is contributing to racial/ethnic disparities and increasing trends in SMM. Our goal is to improve the understanding of SMM and its risk factors to provide evidence that supports efforts to reduce the prevalence of SMM and racial/ethnic disparities in SMM. The proposed project will use linked vital statistics, patient discharge, and U.S. Census data for over 4 million births in California from 2007 to 2014. We will test trends in SMM prevalence and calculate the population attributable risks for three key potential risk factors—advanced maternal age, prepregnancy obesity, and cesarean delivery—and their combination across the years of study (Aim 1). Additionally, we will examine a wide range of potential risk factors to identify those that are most important using a machine-learning/data-adaptive approach (Aim 2). Both study aims will be done in the overall sample and separately in racial/ethnic groups. Understanding SMM trends and determining the strongest predictors of SMM are critical steps to launch forward research of this pressing and understudied public health problem. Many factors may present crucial opportunities to prevent the development severe maternal morbidity—saving the lives of mothers and helping ensure a healthy future for their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year, more and more new mothers are diagnosed with serious pregnancy-related medical conditions, particularly mothers who identify as racial/ethnic minorities. Research is urgently needed to understand what is driving this alarming problem and what puts women most at risk so future research can be conducted to guide interventions and clinical care for childbearing women.","Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities",9327774,F32HD091945,"['Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Age', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patient Discharge', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Population Study', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Vital Statistics', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'advanced maternal age', 'base', 'child bearing', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'improved', 'indexing', 'maternal morbidity', 'outcome prediction', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'social', 'trend']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,56334,-0.012661806123187434
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9251907,R01MH059929,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Exposure to', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'clinical imaging', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'information processing', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'pre-clinical', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'symptomatology', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,653164,-0.008834772455466159
"Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis Dr. Hwanhee Hong is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development. Dr. Hong will also use all available resources from other Departments including biostatistics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. This environment maximizes the potential for Dr. Hong to obtain the necessary training and perform the research to establish herself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program. This project will help mental health researchers generalize, apply, and implement findings from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials to target populations. Traditional meta-analyses enable us to borrow strength across multiple studies to gain more power, resulting in reliable and precise effect estimates; however they do not consider how well the trials represent target populations of interest. By developing methods to help generalize the results of meta-analyses, we will help translate results into appropriate decisions regarding broad implementation and clinical practice.",Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis,9385505,K99MH111807,"['Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data access', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'informal learning', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open data', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'working group']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2017,110318,-0.03144619583407776
"Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity is associated with high financial cost and increased morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Health care spending due to obesity is estimated to be as high as \$210 billion annually, or 21\% of total national spending. A childhood obesity surveillance system will discern disparities, detect aberrant signals, design targeted interventions, and track change over time. In addition to national public health surveillance systems, local data are increasingly necessary to reflect regional trends. Current systems in Wisconsin are subject to (1) bias estimation of obesity rates, (2) limited data in school-aged children ages 5-10 years, (3) insufficient power to estimate disparities in local subgroups, and (4) limited ability to track local changes over time. Therefore, the impact of investments and collective efforts in Wisconsin childhood obesity prevention has been difficult to measure. This, in turn, demands approaches that overcome and transcend the posited limitations. Since large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, there has been a paradigm shift and accelerated improvements in the use of EHR data for the purpose of population health promotion and tracking of progress. The University of Wisconsin Population Health Information Exchange (PHINEX) database contains de- identified EHR data from a multicenter healthcare system located primarily in south central Wisconsin. In partnership with The Wisconsin Obesity Prevention Initiative, we aim to create an EHR model for a childhood obesity prevention surveillance system. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods using the platform of PHINEX for childhood obesity prevention purposes. This enhance and extend surveillance activities of childhood obesity conditions, and increase the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions aimed at changing policies, systems, and environments associated with childhood obesity. We plan to address the following aims: (1) robust estimation of the spatiotemporal prevalence at area level, (2) hot spot detection on areas with aberrant obesity incidence, and (3) prediction for childhood weight gain phenotypes. The developed and implemented surveillance system can benefit future planning, legislation and implementation in other states and/or surveillance of other acute and chronic health conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood obesity has emerged as a leading health concern in the 21st century. Current data sources from which childhood obesity estimates are derived in most systems are primarily cross-sectional, are from small sample sizes, and/or have limited generalizability. Large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, which provide unprecedented opportunities for individual and population health surveillance. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods to increase the use of large EHR data for childhood obesity prevention purposes, extending the scope of public health surveillance.",Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data,9328110,R21HD086754,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family Practice', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hot Spot', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Municipalities', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'School-Age Population', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smiling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'population based', 'population health', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'user friendly software']",NICHD,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R21,2017,259287,-0.02925916145944903
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9341673,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment effect', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2017,589358,-0.017066100011731485
"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms. Expertise in clinical, computational, and technology disciplines form the team to realize these goals. This is a study that focuses on the ability of technological methods to detect speech and behavioral patterns in patients with bipolar disorder across cultural boundaries to identify common features that predict mood states. The overall goal is to use computational methods for the early detection of affect and mood changes that will provide the opportunity to monitor mood disorders using common methods regardless of cultural differences.",MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures,9340389,R21MH114835,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'American', 'Arabs', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Immigrant', 'Immigration', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lebanon', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multilingualism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data management', 'design', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'handheld mobile device', 'health data', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'markov model', 'mobile computing', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2017,30000,-0.06208124923874538
"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9381203,K99ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune System and Related Disorders', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'tool']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2017,94114,-0.05798738846657969
"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",9321191,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'CNR2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Sociology', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'traumatic event', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2017,165886,-0.0021411032893043414
"Advancing a novel portable detection method for cannabis intoxication Intoxication from marijuana (MJ) impairs psychomotor performance and at least doubles the risk of motor vehicle accidents. The ongoing wave of legalization of MJ has brought increasing prevalence of driving while intoxicated with MJ. However, there is no quantitative biologic test that can accurately determine whether an individual is acutely impaired from MJ intoxication. Assays of the primary intoxicating substance in MJ, THC, in body fluids has a high false negative rate as THC is cleared from blood within 15 minutes, long before impairment is resolved. And assays of THC metabolites yield a high false positive rate because clearance of these metabolites can take weeks. Thus there is now no nor is there likely to ever be a test of blood, breath or body fluids that can accurately detect MJ intoxication. In response to this significant knowledge gap, this project aims to develop an accurate, portable method for detection of impairment due to MJ intoxication using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS is a non-invasive, safe brain imaging technique that capitalizes on differences in the light absorption spectra of deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), that allows the measurement of relative changes in Hb concentration that reflect brain activity. fNIRS can be performed in natural environments at low cost, and thus can be used in real-world settings. In Phase I, we will develop an algorithm for individual-level detection of impairment from THC using fNIRS measurements. To do so, we will assess the effect of oral THC (or placebo) on fNIRS measurements, self-reported intoxication, and impairment as defined by the gold standard field sobriety test conducted by a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) in 40 healthy MJ users. fNIRS assessments will examine (1) the effect of THC exposure on resting state and task-based activation in the prefrontal cortex, (2) the extent to which impairment in psychomotor functioning with THC administration correlates with THC-induced change in hemodynamic responses detected with fNIRS, and (3) the sensitivity and specificity and area under the ROC curve of fNIRS measurements and field sobriety test determinants of impairment. Milestone: Should machine learning applications to the data generate an algorithm that predicts impairment with >80% accuracy compared with a gold standard field sobriety test, we will proceed to Phase II. In Phase II, we will conduct fNIRS testing in 150 individuals under THC/placebo as in Phase I and in 50 individuals in a THC plus alcohol/placebo condition in order to further refine the algorithm for MJ impairment detection such that fNIRS detection concurs with field sobriety testing with >90% specificity. It is anticipated that this level of specificity could be used in legal definitions of impairment. This will warrant commercialization, which will be followed by prototype development and field testing. An accurate, quantitative, biological test that is user-friendly and enables law enforcement to detect impairment from MJ has the potential to dramatically change practice of law enforcement across the country and the world and thus has enormous commercial potential, as outlined in the Commercialization Plan and in accompanying letters of support. The goal of this project is to develop, test, and refine a method to accurately and reliably detect marijuana (MJ) impairment using a portable, user-friendly, non-invasive, brain-based modality. MJ doubles the chance of motor vehicle accidents, yet, there now exists no valid, biologically based method to detect whether an individual is acutely impaired from MJ. The development of a reliable, quantitative biological marker that enables law enforcement officers to screen individuals whom they suspect are impaired from MJ will have highly significant public health importance and enormous commercial potential.",Advancing a novel portable detection method for cannabis intoxication,9334516,R42DA043977,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Body Fluids', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Breath Tests', 'Cannabis', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Country', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Driving While Intoxicated', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Legal', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Oral', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebo Control', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Psychomotor Impairments', 'Psychomotor Performance', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'System', 'THC exposure', 'Testing', 'Tetrahydrocannabinol', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Vendor', 'absorption', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'behavior test', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'density', 'detector', 'driving under influence', 'drug testing', 'field sobriety tests', 'field study', 'functional disability', 'hemodynamics', 'interest', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana user', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'response', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vehicular accident']",NIDA,"HIGHLIGHTI, INC",R42,2017,224973,-0.01759201688364537
"Understanding the impact of environmental disruption in biological timing systems through signal processing. Project Summary/Abstract.  Life on Earth evolved to take time cues from the Sun. Consequently, most or all cells in the mammalian body use genetic feedback loops to time their daily (circadian) rhythms. When a person or any mammal sees light, that winds an orchestrating circadian brain clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN in turn helps keep the myriad other tissue and endocrine rhythms in synchrony, enabling health. The modern environment is highly disruptive to this internal synchrony. Light at night from cell phones or urban light pollution, and social impositions like school start times or rotating work shifts all act as “temporal pollution,” causing loss of internal synchrony. The more severe the desynchrony, the higher the risk for a broad range of diseases, including obesity, cancer, infertility, depression and ultimately cognitive decline. Without knowing how these systems normally maintain synchrony or which systems are normally synchronized, it is hard to understand what happens in desynchrony to degrade health. This problem is complicated by the fact that some biological systems have ultradian (every few hours) and infradian (every few days) cycles in addition to circadian cycles. The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) generates ultradian rhythms through negative feedback, but also shows a strong circadian cycle; the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG) shows the same negative feedback ultradian activity, circadian rhythmicity, and also infradian rhythms of ovulation and spermatogenesis. These two axes are regulated by the SCN. Recent work indicates that there is cross-talk between these axes, and that their hormonal outputs - corticosterone, and estradiol (in females) and testosterone (in males), respectively – work to synchronize extra-SCN tissues and behavioral rhythms of feeding and drinking (FaD). Finally, the SCN, HPA, and HPG axes all affect core body temperature (CBT), so that high temporal resolution recordings of CBT contain information about the cycling and synchrony of these systems across time scales.  There are three aims to this proposal, using rats as a model system: 1) Test at high temporal resolution the effects of changes to the HPA axis, HPG axis, and SCN on CBT. 2) Use these relationships to build a model that can back-predict the state of the HPA axis, HPG axis, and SCN from a high temporal resolution CBT record of a given individual. 3) Expose rats to environmental temporal disruption in the form of a 6 h “jetlag” phase advance of the light cycle, and use the model to predict the response across these systems at 1-minute temporal resolution. This work will employ within-animal comparisons before and after surgical and pharmacological manipulations of rats whose FaD, activity, and CBT are captured continuously at 1-minute resolution. These data will be analyzed using signal-processing and machine learning to define patterns and relationships. The resulting model will allow minimally-invasive exploration of environmental disruption across physiological systems in real time. The model will be used to quantify synchrony as it is disrupted and re-emerges, identifying markers for risk or resilience, and generating hypotheses for future work into preventive strategies and treatments. Project Narrative. Artificial lights and social obligation cause people living with modern infrastructure to suffer a loss of synchrony across their organs, which evolved to track the stable day and year light cycles. We know about internal synchrony mostly by the diseases that arise from its loss – everything from cancer to obesity, depression, and infertility. This work will develop a system for tracking the cycles of many body-systems at the same time with minute-to-minute accuracy, allowing rapid detection of desynchrony, and a potential way to study how synchrony works normally, and why its disruption by the modern environment causes disease.",Understanding the impact of environmental disruption in biological timing systems through signal processing.,9386306,K99ES027509,"['Address', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Body Temperature', 'Body Temperature Changes', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Corticosterone', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dysmenorrhea', 'Dyspepsia', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Environment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Estradiol', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormonal Change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Jet Lag Syndrome', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Orphan', 'Output', 'Ovulation', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System', 'Planet Earth', 'Pollution', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Rattus', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Obligations', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'body system', 'comparative', 'drinking', 'feeding', 'high risk', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'minimally invasive', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid detection', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'response', 'shift work', 'signal processing', 'social', 'suprachiasmatic nucleus', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'time use']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2017,98712,-0.015860407062235963
"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,9288629,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Imagery', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Regimen', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'distraction', 'evidence base', 'haptics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'training opportunity', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,313412,-0.012337664829312207
"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9386536,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2017,118352,-0.010733440330279611
"Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions ABSTRACT Bullying is a preventable public health problem that can have long-lasting health, academic and social consequences. Bullying affects between 18% and 31% of adolescents and has been associated with serious negative consequences including depression, substance use, and academic failure for both the perpetrator and target. Over the past decade, bullying behavior has expanded into the digital realm and is known as cyberbullying. Cyberbullying stories have had frequent coverage by news organizations, including coverage of teens whose death from suicide was attributed to cyberbullying. Previous work illustrates the influence of news stories on individual’s attitudes and experiences. News organization coverage has been influential to readers in areas such as suicide, infectious disease outbreaks such as H1N1 flu, and tobacco use. Little is known whether and how adolescents and their families perceive or utilize news coverage of bullying or cyberbullying. News media may be an untapped resource to promote bullying prevention messages and strategies. Our long- term goal is to develop and test interventions to improve bullying prevention and intervention efforts working with media. Towards that goal, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news organization coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families. First, we will evaluate youth and parent perspectives on lay media coverage of bullying using qualitative interviews with 50 participants: 25 diverse adolescents age 15-18 years and 25 parent/guardians of these adolescents. Second, we will assess the current state of the narrative in news media coverage of bullying. We will identify a sample of 500 news articles from print/online media that cover bullying over the past 5 years and conduct content analysis using natural language processing. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software we will evaluate the proportion of words that represent fear-based reporting such as alarmist words (e.g. epidemic, tragic), as well as words that represent public health-oriented messages such as prevention. We will also compare news coverage of bullying to cyberbullying. After analyzing data from these two aims, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 journalists. Our third aim is to synthesize these findings and identify strategies for future interventions that are feasible and acceptable to journalists. We will work with 3 consultants from the fields of communication and journalism to identify and engage journalists (n=30) in qualitative interviews. When these interconnected study aims are successfully completed, outcomes will include a comprehensive understanding of how adolescents and their parents understand and utilize news coverage of bullying, the current state of bullying and cyberbullying news coverage narrative, and perspectives of journalists on intervention approaches that are feasible and acceptable. We will utilize these findings towards novel intervention approaches, such as to leverage news coverage towards enhancing prevention of bullying. PROJECT NARRATIVE Previous studies have shown that news media coverage of health issues can change attitudes and behaviors; for example, journalists’ approach to suicide can have significant impact on bereaved families and at-risk youth. News media can also complement public health efforts, such as through coverage of tobacco harms that have been shown to prevent smoking among adolescents. Bullying is a significant public health issues that can lead to short and long-term health effects and is frequently covered by news media; thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families towards developing future interventions.",Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions,9390299,R21HD090221,"['Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemic', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Priorities', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Influentials', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Journalism', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoking', 'Suicide', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'bullying', 'bullying prevention', 'contagion', 'cyberbullying', 'digital', 'experience', 'flu', 'health organization', 'improved', 'news', 'novel', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'sexual minority', 'social', 'social stigma', 'success', 'suicidal morbidity']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2017,231830,-0.04334787576735049
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",9246108,U24DK112331,"['ATAC-seq', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Research Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cost', 'data resource', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'fitness', 'gene product', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput analysis', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'methylome', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sedentary', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web page', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2017,93230,-0.009464053236001975
"Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the “Alcoa Study” remains the development of increasingly rich models to explain the disparate health and work-capacity trajectories demonstrated in this universally insured, geographically, socially and economically diverse cohort of 200,000+ men and women as they progress from work-life into retirement. Outcomes of focus remain incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to 1) early life social context via Census data; 2) personal and family work experience and income across the life span via IRS and SSA; 3) post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI) and 4) contextual social environment from lifetime residential geocoding. Consequently, we propose in the next cycle to embrace a life course approach to study the social, environmental and behavioral determinants of the outcomes listed above The specific aims of this grant are: Aim 1: Link Alcoa workers to individual census records to examine how early life environment influences later life health outcomes; Aim 2: Assess the impact on health and function of adverse working environment as it accrues during work-life, with an emphasis on ubiquitous physical hazards; Aim 3: Identify antecedents of short-term and long-term disability across working life as candidates for subsequent hypothesis testing; Aim 4: Assess the impact disability benefits have on employee work function and health; Aim 5: Examine how injuries and health shocks affect retirement savings and subsequent health trajectories; Aim 6: To address generalizability across studies and populations, compare the Alcoa population to relevant complementary datasets, administrative and survey. Viewed altogether, continuation of the Alcoa study with the assembled team of investigators provides an unparalleled opportunity to address a host of critical empiric and methodologic issues previously unapproachable. In addition to understanding better which occupational exposures contribute to chronic disease and disability, these data will allow us to control for economic and other contextual factors to an extraordinary degree. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Alcoa research infrastructure—linking quantitative exposure measures to myriad hazards of active workers whose behavior, social environment and health status from pre-employment through retirement to death are fully observed—provides a unique opportunity to extend our work on the outcomes of focus including incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to early life social context, personal and family work experience and income and post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI).","Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce",9310192,R01AG026291,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Disability Insurance', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Occupational Health', 'Outcome', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Price', 'Privatization', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Shock', 'Social Environment', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disability impact', 'experience', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'study population', 'uptake']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,757494,-0.0355640497419798
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",9508669,U24DK112331,"['ATAC-seq', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Research Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cost', 'data resource', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'fitness', 'gene product', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput analysis', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'methylome', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sedentary', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web page', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2017,162828,-0.009464053236001975
"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,9278303,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'novel therapeutics', 'population health', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2017,176472,-0.010935339592609184
"How Does Automated Record Linkage Affect Inferences about Population Health? ABSTRACT  Our broad research objective is to create the Longitudinal Intergenerational Family Electronic Micro-dataset (LIFE-M) spanning the late 19th and 20th century United States. Using automated record linkage technology, the LIFE-M project combines millions of vital records to reconstruct how and why individuals' health has changed across time. This multi-generational, longitudinal micro-database aims to transform research on health and longevity, on childbearing and family structure, and on the long-run health effects of early-life circumstances and exposures.  In creating LIFE-M, however, we have encountered serious deficits in knowledge about the performance of automated record linkage technology. The proposed project seeks to evaluate the performance of the most popular and cutting-edge automated linking techniques for the purposes of creating longitudinal health data. Our specific aims are to (1) produce systematic evidence regarding the performance of automated record linking algorithms in terms of match rates, representativeness of the linked sample, erroneous matches (type I errors), and systematic measurement error; (2) examine how phonetic name-cleaning methods affect quality metrics; and (3) examine how record quality metrics vary for different underrepresented subgroups (including women, racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrants) and to determine how linking methods affect representativeness and inferences. To achieve these aims, we have developed new partnerships with record linking experts allowing us to incorporate the most cutting-edge methods in record linking. We will also rely on new “ground truth” generated by LIFE-M project's independent, double-blind human review process.  This project will contribute significantly to existing knowledge about the use of automated linking methods for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health data. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in health studies. Both contributions should greatly enhance the quality of descriptive and causal inferences about population health and aging and disparities in these outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project contributes to public health knowledge by advancing record linking methodology for creating longitudinal and intergenerational health datasets. It will also increase knowledge about potential sources of bias in public health and aging studies using linked records.

"Institutional Research Collaboration between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Centers for Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Project summary This is the 3rd, 5-year collaborative agreement between CDC's Malaria Branch and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). The proposed research strategy follows the objectives outlined in the FOA and involves 4 themes: a) Operational research (OR) related to malaria transmission reduction, b) OR to identify novel or improved interventions for children with severe malarial anaemia and pregnant women, c) Maximising the public health impact by supporting translation of global policies for the control of malaria in pregnancy to country level policies through information exchange (3.1), and d) Strengthening research capacity of the overseas partners in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia by provision of individual level PhD and post-doctoral studentships and group courses (5.1). Malaria transmission reduction OR activities take place under the umbrella of the long-term collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and CDC in Kenya. LSTM will work with CDC to provide technical support to KEMRI to build the information infrastructure needed to track malaria transmission intensity and progress towards malaria control targets, including the rational development of large-scale entomological monitoring systems in situations with declining vector densities, increased outdoor biting and vector resistance to the commonly used insecticides (1.1), support the development of enhanced semi-automated routine surveillance systems with scannable registers, and conduct continuous malaria indicator surveys for real- time monitoring of the case-burden and infection prevalence (4.1). LSTM will support CDC to develop the concept and seek funding for proof-of-principle studies that determine the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of mass-drug administration with antimalarials when combined with indoor residual spraying (2.1). It will support dose finding studies with primaquine and ivermectin that aim to identify adjunct therapies to enhance the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) (2.2), and support the economic evaluation of different interventions and surveillance methods as part of the transmission reduction activities (2.3). Studies in high risk groups includes research to improve adherence to malaria case-management guidelines in pregnancy in western Kenya (1.2) and three large multi-centre trials including one on the prevention of rebound admissions and deaths with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in children with severe anaemia in Kenya (2.4) and two on the control of malaria in pregnancy: STOPMiP-Indonesia (2.6), STOPMIP2 in Kenya and Malawi (2.5) evaluating the safety and efficacy of intermittent preventive therapy with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Project Narrative The aim of the proposed collaboration is to improve the use of existing interventions and to explore new ways to reduce the burden of malaria in high risk groups such as young children and pregnant women. In addition it aims to explore the effect of different combinations of area-wide interventions to reduce malaria transmission and to evaluate surveillance tools that can measure the beneficial impact on populations in terms of health, household level wealth and quality of health service delivery.

"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9396635,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2017,56334,-0.05501101987414363

"Monitoring and Stabilizing Behavioral Rhythms to Improve Mental Health Abstract: HealthRhythms, Inc. Substantial evidence supports the idea that disruptions in the regularity of behavioral routines (or ‘social rhythms’) can lead to the onset of psychiatric symptoms and full blown episodes via their impact on endogenous circadian rhythms and, conversely that stable social routines protect against new mood episodes. Based on our conviction that monitoring, evaluating, and increasing the regularity of behavioral rhythms has broad applicability for improving mental health, we established HealthRhythms, Inc. (www.healthrhythms.com) with the goal of using mobile technology to add the layer of mental health care to all of healthcare. Our product model capitalizes on the ubiquity and intimacy of smartphones and their capacity to sense parameters of behavior that represent key indicators of mental health on a 24/7 basis captured in the user’s natural environment, opposed to the sporadic, in-clinic measurement that has characterized mental healthcare to date. The product we envision will ultimately have three pillars: Rhythm Sensing, Rhythm Trending, and Rhythm Stabilization. The first two of these pillars have been developed and thousands of licenses for our product have already been sold. Building on our accomplishments to date, this SBIR Phase II Direct proposal extends our work in three ways: 1) further validating our existing technology, 2) developing the next stage of our technology and 3) expanding and improving our prediction models and demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of our technology. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Enhance our Rhythm Trending capabilities through intensive examination and analysis of data from the 3,000+ patients with whom our product has already been deployed. Aim 2: Develop the envisioned Rhythm Stabilization pillar of our technology. Aim 3: Expand the nature of the data included in our prediction models and demonstrate their utility.

"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9284636,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2017,566219,0.0021632436928388675
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9341305,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'portability', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'stroke survivor', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2017,166794,-0.0024934818608575407
"Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD The identification of neurobiological markers associated with childhood status and persistence vs. remission of the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) over development, and the translation of these markers into more effective diagnosis and intervention strategies are major priorities of NIMH. The persistence of ADHD into adulthood in many but not all afflicted children attests to the considerable variability in the remission of symptoms over development. However, evidence of cortical and subcortical structural anomalies associated with the persistence versus remission of ADHD is relatively limited, and not fully consistent. [Our group is in a unique position to test the neurobiological mechanisms associated with the childhood status and the developmental trajectories of ADHD]. We recently completed a 15-year longitudinal study of ADHD that recruited and clinically followed a large sample of children with ADHD into adulthood, as well as a well- matched sample of never ADHD controls that was recruited in adolescence and followed into adulthood. This large sample represents the diversity of outcomes characteristic of ADHD and was scanned with multi-modal neuroimaging in adulthood. Published results of our functional neuroimaging study support the distinction in neural mechanisms associated with the emergence and remission of ADHD. Young adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were marked by reduced regardless of adult outcome, while the remission of ADHD symptoms in adulthood was associated with enhanced cue-related thalamo-prefrontal functional connectivity. [However, the neuroanatomical evidence of this double-dissociation model of ADHD emergence and remission has not yet been investigated cue-related thalamus activation and functional connectivity with brainstem . By capitalizing on the availability of both neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical data from our recently completed study and utilizing advanced neuroimaging analysis and multivariate machine leaning techniques, this proposal aims to identify the neuroanatomical correlates of childhood status and remission of ADHD in young adults, and to link the anatomical evidence with the functional and longitudinal clinical evidence associated with persistent vs. remitted ADHD. The ultimate goal is to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into clinically applicable biomarkers that can guide individualized interventions in youth with ADHD.] Our central hypotheses are that: (1) childhood ADHD is associated with thalamo-brainstem structural disconnectivity that endures into adulthood regardless of the developmental trajectory of the disorder; and (2) diminution of symptoms is related to optimal prefrontal development and its anatomical connectivity with other brain regions. The ultimate goal of this proposal is innovative and directly relevant to the NIMH mission, to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into more clinically applicable biomarkers that can serve as targets for the development of interventions in youth with ADHD. NARRATIVE Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent within the general population, with significant cognitive impairments that can exist throughout the lifespan. This project aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with the persistence vs. remission of ADHD. The resulting data will identify potential biological markers for persistent and remitted ADHD, which will feed forward to improved diagnostic abilities, and lead to improved option for prevention and intervention targets.",Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD,9357677,R03MH109791,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dissociation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Etiology', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Structural defect', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'disorder control', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'feeding', 'forest', 'gray matter', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'model development', 'multimodality', 'myelination', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'proband', 'therapy development', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R03,2017,76750,-0.022069307499181377
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9354508,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,201353,-0.0014970321830391502
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9329487,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,1254231,-0.04695202770140751
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9313961,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2017,563079,-0.023927017851148636
"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,9443649,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Infant Mortality', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,376620,-0.019041114909115944
"Air Pollution, Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation in MESA Abstract Kaufman: Air pollution, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation burden in MESA This proposal examines the impact of ambient air pollutants on the development, burden, and triggering of heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Air pollutants, especially particulate matter, have been associated with the incidence of cardiovascular disease, especially coronary heart disease and stroke. The incidence of coronary heart disease and stroke is declining due to prevention efforts, while development of heart failure (HF, especially with preserved ejection fraction, HFpEF) and atrial arrhythmias (especially atrial fibrillation, AF) are becoming more important components of the burden of cardiovascular disease; the role of environmental factors in these two frequently co-existing conditions diseases is largely unstudied. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is an extraordinarily valuable cohort for understanding predictors and correlates of heart failure and atrial fibrillation, due to participants’ ages, extensive existing phenotyping, and planned assessment in an examination beginning in 2016. In addition, MESA has become the most carefully studied cohort in terms of exposure to ambient air pollutants. This proposed study will extend the air pollutant characterization using innovative low-cost indoor and outdoor home-based monitoring and state-of-the-art modeling approaches incorporating extensive geographic inputs. We will characterize both the relationship between long-term ambient exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), oxides of nitrogen (NOX), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO), and development of early stage heart failure and atrial arrhythmias, and the relationship between short-term exposure to air pollutants and triggering of atrial arrhythmias and AF burden. It is important to understand these relationships since: 1) Air pollutants are associated with cardiovascular mortality; 2) HF and structural disease correlates of HF are risk factors for AF; and 3) HFpEF with AF represents a group at especially high mortality risk. We will estimate long-term (annual average) and short-term (hourly and daily) concentrations of PM2.5, NOX, NO2, O3, and CO, outside and inside all MESA participants’ homes using state-of-the-art monitoring technology and spatiotemporal statistical models. We will use novel low-cost pollutant monitoring sensors at a subset of MESA participant homes and community locations. Early evidence of prevalent HF subtypes and newly emerging sub-phenotypes will be assessed using information from in-exam echocardiographic cardiac parameters, 6-minute walk test results, arterial tonometry, and biomarkers (NTproBNP, sST2, galectin-3). Ambulatory novel two-week ECG monitoring and interrogations of implanted pacemakers and cardioverter-defibrillators will allow us to assess the association between long-term air pollution exposure and AF and short-term air pollution and the triggering of atrial arrhythmias. Through this effort, we will gain unprecedented insight into the role of air pollutants in development of cardiovascular disease, with a focus on HF, especially HFpEF, and on AF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are increasingly important health problems as our population ages. Air pollution exposures have been linked to both HF and AF, but many questions remain about the relationships, and new technologies are available to study this. By understanding the relationship between short- and long-term air pollution exposures and the development of HF and triggering and burden of AF, we can gain critical information to help protect public health, reduce health inequality, and inform air quality regulatory policy.","Air Pollution, Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation in MESA",9386363,R56ES026528,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological Markers', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Defibrillators', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exercise stress test', 'Exposure to', 'Galectin 3', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Implant', 'Incidence', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocarditis', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'Nitrogen Oxides', 'Obesity', 'Ozone', 'Pacemakers', 'Participant', 'Particulate Matter', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'aging population', 'ambient air pollution', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'cardiogenesis', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cohort', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'disability', 'environmental agent', 'fine particles', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'innovation', 'insight', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pollutant', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'success']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R56,2017,600964,-0.021858279543237748
"Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health PROJECT SUMMARY Nearly 10% of Americans practice meditation to improve health. Randomized controlled trials support this practice and show that mindfulness training is effective in improving a broad range of health outcomes. In particular, mindfulness training has been shown to reduce biomarkers of systemic inflammation that contribute to the pathophysiology of disease and predict risk for all-cause mortality. Still, little is known about the biological processes linking mindfulness training with inflammation. This proposal tests the hypothesis that mindfulness training aids the regulation of inflammation by mitigating glucocorticoid resistance (GCR). GCR is a leading candidate mechanism linking psychosocial threat with systemic inflammation. Whereas cortisol released in response to threat normally binds to glucocorticoid receptors and down-regulates inflammation, chronic perceptions of threat lead to a state of GCR, in which glucocorticoid receptors become insensitive to the anti-inflammatory effects of circulating cortisol. Mindfulness training is proposed to diminish perceptions of threat in ways that restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity. To test this biological pathway, this study assesses functional GCR and biomarkers of inflammation before and after a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or control Health Enhancement Program (HEP) in a sample of lonely older adults (N=188). Loneliness is a form of chronic psychosocial threat, and is consistently associated with GCR and systemic inflammation, yet MBSR is one of very few interventions successful in reducing loneliness. MBSR is expected to decrease GCR (and restore glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity) compared to HEP from pre- to post- intervention. Moreover, these decreases in GCR are expected to mediate the effects of MBSR (vs. HEP) on lowering systemic inflammation (CRP and IL-6) from pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up. In sum, this proposal investigates decreased GCR as a biological mechanism through which mindfulness training reduces inflammatory disease risk. It addresses NCCIH's call for research on understanding the biological mechanisms of action underlying mind-body intervention approaches and complements NCCIH's special interest in alleviating inflammatory processes. The knowledge gained from this research will contribute to a better understanding of the basic biological pathways underlying mindfulness practices, which may help to identify and target populations likely to benefit from mindfulness training. The research and training plan described in this application provide opportunities for the applicant to develop a knowledge base and methodology in psychoneuroimmunology, learn statistical techniques for analyzing complex mechanistic pathways, and develop the professional skills necessary for a successful career testing biological and psychological mechanisms underlying mind-body interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mindfulness meditation practices are widely used to alleviate physical symptoms, and growing evidence suggests that mindfulness training may reduce systemic inflammation, but less is known about the biological pathways linking mindfulness training with inflammatory processes. The proposed project investigates a biological mechanism, glucocorticoid sensitivity, to explain how mindfulness training lowers inflammation among lonely older adults who are at risk for multiple inflammatory diseases. From a public health perspective, clarifying this mechanistic pathway will help to identify who is likely to show health benefits from mindfulness training.",Biological Mechanisms of Mindfulness Training for Health,9327105,F32AT009508,"['Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood Circulation', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Dexamethasone', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Feeling', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Immune', 'Immunology procedure', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meditation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Mind-Body Intervention', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychoneuroimmunology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'career', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy trial', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health training', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mindfulness meditation', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'physical symptom', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'receptor function', 'receptor sensitivity', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'successful intervention', 'training aid', 'training opportunity']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2017,60834,-0.034991119792995067
"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",9313715,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular Abnormalities', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'exercise intolerance', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,1338683,-0.01996860823493075
"A Direct Reading Video Assessment Instrument for Repetitive Motion Stress Project Summary/ Abstract This research studies if computer vision can more effectively evaluate worker exposure and assess the associated risk for work related injuries than conventional methods. Current methods involve either observations or measurements using instruments attached to a worker's hands or arms. Observation is often considered too subjective or inaccurate, and instruments too invasive or time consuming for routine applications in industry. Automated job analysis potentially offers a more objective, accurate, repeatable, and efficient exposure assessment tool than observational analysis. Computer vision uses less resources than instruments attached to workers and does not interfere with production; can quantify more exposure variables and interactions; is suitable for long-term, direct reading exposure assessment; and offers animated data visualizations synchronized with video for identifying aspects of jobs needing interventions. This research leverages the research from coordinated multi-institutional prospective studies of upper limb work related MSD conducted between 2001 and 2010 that studied production and service workers from a variety of US industries, and used rigorous case-criteria and individual-level exposure assessments prospectively, including recording detailed videos of the work. Our study partners from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Washington State Labor & Industries Safety & Health Assessment & Research for Prevention program and the University of California-San Francisco will provide task-level videos, associated exposure variable data, and prospective health outcomes for 1,649 workers. Exposure properties directly measured from videos of jobs and corresponding health outcomes from the prospective study database will establish dose-response relationships to translate into a prototype automated job analysis instrument. We build on our previous success in developing video marker-less hand motion algorithms for estimating the ACGIH hand activity level, and reliable video processing methods for hand tracking under challenging viewing conditions. This proposal will refine and develop additional video algorithms, and analyze the videos to extract exposure measures for repetition, posture, exertions, and their interactions. The video extracted exposure measures will be compared against conventional observational exposure measures made by our collaborators. Video and corresponding observational data will be merged with the prospective health outcomes data to evaluate dose-response and to develop and validate parsimonious exposure risk models for an automated direct reading repetitive motion instrument. We will test if automation has better predictive capability than observation and also consider the accuracy and utility of computer vision analysis against conventional job analysis for selected industrial jobs. This proposal addresses the NIOSH cross-sector programs in Musculoskeletal Disorders as well as in Exposure Assessment.

"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9312144,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2017,130380,-0.005093232519546422
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,9285614,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'learning strategy', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2017,747607,-0.00017196814298463248
"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images.

"Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The use of accelerometers for the measurement of physical activity in youth has increased substantially over the last decade. Accelerometers are typically worn on the waist, however recently alternative placement sites such as the wrist have become more popular. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is currently using the wrist location for their accelerometer physical activity measurements. Currently there is a lack of information about best approaches for analyzing accelerometer data from the wrist location with the ActiGraph accelerometer. In addition, advances in accelerometer technology allow for utilization of the raw acceleration signal with machine learning algorithms, which have the capability to predict activities and improve the estimates of energy expenditure over previously used methods. Members of this research group have shown improved activity classification and energy expenditure prediction in youth using Bipart, versus commonly used approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine. However, this preliminary work was based on accelerometer count data and structured lab activities with only a hip worn accelerometer. In addition, there are limitations to applying lab based models to true free-living activity. For example, free-living activity is not performed in structured bouts rather it is performed in micro-bouts over the course of the day which is problematic for methods designed to look at a string of data over a specified time period. There is minimal work currently on how to first segment bouts of free-living activity before classifying activity type and predicting energy expenditure. This proposal will extend our previous work using more advanced methods to analyze raw acceleration data (80 Hz) using a single wrist or hip worn accelerometer. One hundred youth will be measured during a semi-structured simulated free-living period (development group) and 200 youth will be measured during true free-living activity during an after-school program and at home (validation group). Measurements will include indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure and direct observation for activity type. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to segment bouts of activity during free-living activity in youth using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer, and 2) develop and validate machine learning algorithms to classify physical activity type and estimate energy expenditure in youth, during free-living activity using: A) a hip worn accelerometer or B) a wrist worn accelerometer. Results from these studies will have direct and immediate impact for physical activity researchers utilizing accelerometers as well as analysis of NHANES wrist accelerometer data by providing ac- curate and precise methods for bout segmentation, prediction of activity type and energy expenditure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and validate machine learning algorithms using raw accelerometer data collected at the hip or wrist for use in youth. These algorithms will be able to detect the start and end times of free-living physical activity bouts, classify the type of activity being performed, and estimate energy expenditure, significantly improving upon current methods. These algorithms will have direct benefit to those examining dose response relationships between sedentary behaviors, physical activity and health outcomes in youth, in the physical activity and public health fields.            ",Novel Approaches for Predicting Unstructured Short Periods of Physical Activities in Youth,9030093,R01HD083431,"['18 year old', 'Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Hip region structure', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Indirect Calorimetry', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'after-school program', 'base', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'physical conditioning', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'success', 'time use']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2016,542228,0.001516153445174404
"Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess body fat is a key underlying factor in the development of numerous chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA recently declared that obesity, itself, is a disease. Most epidemiologic studies utilize Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify people as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese because it is a convenient and simple method that has been shown to correlate with disease risk. Since the majority of the health risks associated with obesity are more directly linked to an overabundance of body fat than weight, measuring body fat is essential for more precise guidelines. However, accurate methods of assessing body fat are expensive, inconvenient, and require immobile equipment. Consequently, the AMA has called for more cost effective and convenient methods to assess body composition to assist doctors in their assessment and treatment. Virtual modeling of humans in particular has provided ways to scan and analyze the body and its motion. Supervised Machine Learning (SML), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, has made great progress in taking measured data to infer new relationships. It is our belief that virtual modeling and SML can provide the techniques necessary to conveniently and accurately calculate the percentage of body fat (%BF) and to provide new tools in treating obesity based on body shapes. The project will develop a system that uses commercially available depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect(r) to capture the surface of the human body. This will be accomplished by developing a new algorithm to perform deformable registration of several RGB-Depth views of the body. A new algorithm that uses SML will be developed to calculate percentage body fat using the surface data. The system will be trained and validated by collecting data from a number of subjects. The surface captured will be used to explore the role of visual body representation in motivation and adherence. The developed systems can be implemented in clinical or personal settings and be utilized as a public health research tool and deployed widely given the low-cost of the hardware required. In addition to the immediate impact that the system will have on managing obesity, the project will have a broad impact on a number of areas. A large database of such shapes captured over time may lead to ways to predict how an individual's body shape will change given a particular intervention. Certain medical conditions that result in body shape change, such as those involving lymphatic circulations, may be diagnosed and tracked more easily. Growth patterns of children may be tracked by change of body shapes. Further research can be conducted to determine the effect of body shape on %BF using data mining techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop a new method to capture the 3D surface and shape of a human body and a new method to use these data to calculate percent body fat. By making these tools widely available and economical, the proposed approach has the potential for major contributions in the assessment and treatment of obesity.",Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models,9099872,R21HL124443,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Belief', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body Surface', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equipment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Muscle', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plethysmography', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Self Perception', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weights and Measures', 'base', 'body density', 'body volume', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder risk', 'lymphatic circulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'preference', 'public health research', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'study population', 'tool', 'virtual', 'weight loss intervention']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,194340,0.0032267807421760605
"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the diagnostic utility of DXA, a safe, non-invasive, and widely available technology, by applying novel image processing and statistical techniques to predict fractures more accurately. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 are destined to suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their remaining lifetime. Unfortunately, the current standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, DXA, does not predict most fractures. This research will develop advanced analyses of DXA images and use machine learning to improve individualized fracture risk assessment.",Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA,9068774,K99AR067883,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'American', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Cadaver', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Osteopenia', 'Osteoporosis', 'Osteoporotic', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Postmenopause', 'Prospective Studies', 'Race', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'bone geometry', 'bone mass', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnosis standard', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2016,91800,-0.018366631481957163
"Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating Poor eating habits, particularly low fruit and vegetable intake, is a growing, serious public health concern, particularly among young adults age 21-30, referred to as Generation Y (GenY). GenY's poor dietary practices are associated with the onset of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, as well as declines in predicted health status and life expectancy. Thus, there is a need to develop effective interventions to improve GenY's eating habits. MENU GenY is a computer-based intervention to encourage increased fruit and vegetable intake among GenY. A critical component of MENU GenY is personalized eCoaching. eCoaches use email to deliver motivation-enhancing coaching to encourage healthy eating, grounded in the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based communication technique to increase intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change. The MI model posits that counselor's use of “MI-consistent” communication techniques are responsible for eliciting behavior change through patient “change talk” (i.e., statements about one's own desire, ability, reasons, need for or commitment to behavior change). A growing body of empirical evidence links change talk to behavior change, but research identifying the specific provider behaviors that elicit patient change talk is limited to specific populations (mainly adults who abuse substances and a couple studies of adolescents). Identifying specific communication strategies linked to behavior change and integrating these strategies into communication-based interventions (e.g., brief, motivation-enhancing interventions delivered in a variety of settings or public health initiatives) can increase these interventions' potency. However, a significant barrier to this research is the qualitative methods traditionally used to analyze the communication process which are resource-intensive, requiring an iterative process of human (subjective) interpretation of text. Rapidly developing computational technologies, specifically machine learning combined with classification models, offer a unique opportunity to accelerate this process. Our research group has recently applied machine learning-based data mining models to similar communication data. We automated a simple communication code scheme to characterize patient communication and achieved accuracy comparable to human coders. The goals of this study are to leverage innovative computer science machine learning and classification models to fully automate the communication coding process and link patterns in eCoach-patient communication to increases in fruit and vegetable intake. We propose a secondary analysis of data collected for a NICHD randomized clinical trial (R01 HD067314). The sample is 160 members of GenY drawn from both urban and rural settings (Detroit metropolitan area and rural Pennsylvania) with outcomes measured at baseline and 3 months. Our validated approach will accelerate the pace of outcomes-oriented communication research and identify effective communication strategies linked to healthy eating. These findings will be used to tailor interventions and public health messages and develop automated eCoaching. This research will use cutting edge computer science technology – machine learning-based classification models – to automate communication coding, a resource-intensive qualitative analysis process, and identify key communication strategies used by eCoaches linked to increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake among young adults age 21-30. Identifying communication strategies linked to increased FV intake will identify empirically derived communication techniques that can be used to tailor interventions and health promotion messages to more effectively promote behavior change in this age group.

"A Clinical 3D Movement Analysis System for Assessing Lower Extremity Injury Risk and Recovery in Athletes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The mission of Bioniks is to develop and commercialize accurate, low-cost movement analysis systems for clinicians, ergonomists, athletic trainers, and other professionals interested in quantifying human movement. Our initial focus is on developing computer enhancements for inexpensive 3D cameras like the Microsoft Kinect. These enhancements surpass the accuracy limitations of state-of-the-art ""skeleton"" by combining established marker-based measurement protocols and advanced computer vision techniques, to generate clinical-quality 3D human motion data.  Difficult to obtain outside a laboratory setting, these kinematic data are inherently valuable for several NIH priority areas: 1) assessment of function and fatigability in older adults (NIA); 2) measurement of gait and posture biomechanics to monitor patients (NIAMS); 3) tools to enable mobile health and telemedicine by providing a means to monitor, evaluate, manage, track, train, and treat patients in underserved community settings and rural and remote locations (NIMHD, NINR); 4) tools for health informatics for clinical and translational research (NCATS); and 5) measurement of occupational health stressors in the workplace (NIOSH).  For this Phase I STTR, Bioniks' goal is to provide therapists with an affordable and easy-to-use 3D movement analysis system that quantifies an athlete's risk for, or recovery from, lower extremity injury. Our first aim is to show that the movement analysis system will not only be accurate and reliable (Aim 1), but also be practical and easy to use (Aim 2). We hypothesize that: 1) our kinematic measurements will agree with those from a gold-standard laboratory-based motion capture system (Vicon); and 2) that therapists will judge our system to be more useful and usable than current clinical tools, including traditional 2D video analyses. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a validation study with healthy volunteers at the UCSF Human Performance Center as well as a pilot usability study with therapists and healthy volunteers and patients with history of ACL injury at the SF Sports and Spine Physical Therapy Clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Because of the high cost and perceived ineffectiveness of traditional musculoskeletal care, there is growing pressure on health care professionals to provide more cost- effective treatments as well as to validate treatment effectiveness. Bioniks has the opportunity to be the first clinic-based tool that quantitatively and objectively assesses musculoskeletal function of patients over the course of treatment and rehabilitation. This STTR proposal focuses on quantification of an athlete's risk for, and recovery from, lower extremity injury.                ",A Clinical 3D Movement Analysis System for Assessing Lower Extremity Injury Risk and Recovery in Athletes,9046038,R41AR068202,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Area', 'Athletic', 'Biomechanics', 'Boxing', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Drops', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knee Injuries', 'Laboratories', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Occupational Health', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Series', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Sports', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Video Games', 'Workplace', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'commercialization', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'healthy volunteer', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'ligament injury', 'mHealth', 'meetings', 'modifiable risk', 'movement analysis', 'neuromuscular function', 'physical therapist', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'stressor', 'tool', 'usability', 'validation studies', 'volunteer']",NIAMS,"BIONIKS, INC.",R41,2016,215600,-0.03812860676045431
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9084432,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Eotaxin', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2016,156324,-0.016794500334877237
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,9119612,R01MH103148,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relapse patients', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,388305,-0.010325026609182138
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,9119862,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Huntington Disease', 'Huntington gene', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2016,356244,-0.013301844322506143
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses multiple priorities of PAR-12-197 ""Improving Diet and Physical Activity (PA) Assessment"" by advancing assessment of population PA in common settings. Physical inactivity is responsible for ≈200,000 deaths in the US and 5 million deaths worldwide annually. About 10% of breast and 10% of colon cancers are attributable to insufficient PA, and inactivity causes 9% of total premature mortality. Parks, schools and youth sports are important contributors of PA that are relevant to a majority of the population. Supporting PA in these settings would contribute to improvements in population levels of PA and disease prevention and control. We will develop a novel video analysis software system, named E-VIP (Ecological Video Identification of PA), which will estimate the number of people and aggregated volume of PA from video recordings of PA- relevant settings. E-VIP will provide automated and continuous (rather than momentary) assessment, which will allow ongoing feedback to inform adaptive interventions and decision making. E-VIP is based on computer science methods used to count crowds and identify behaviors. We will train the E-VIP machine learning algorithm on 32,400 seconds of video from 2 parks, 2 schools, and 2 youth sports settings. Participants will engage in a variety of activities while wearing accelerometers to capture PA intensity in Metabolic Equivalents (METs). The testing phase involves capturing 900, 5-minute videos of free-living behavior across 4 parks, 4 schools, and 4 youth sports settings, with half of the settings/zones being the same as from the training phase. A range of activities and density of people will be captured in both the training and testing phase to maximize coverage of more-difficult high-density situations. Systematic direct observation will be conducted on each time sample to provide the criterion measure for testing validity. The metrics that will be tested include the average number of people, average proportion of people in each activity category (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous), and sum PA MET-minutes in the setting over the 5-minute (or any given) time period. A gender and age group classifier will be explored. PE classes taught by PE specialists vs classroom teachers will be compared to test construct validity of E-VIP. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees, shadows, other people) will be assessed using moderator analyses. By automating ecological PA assessment, E-VIP will be feasible for widespread use. E-VIP's capability of continuous assessment will improve precision by collecting higher resolution data than collected by existing direct observation tools. When embedded in specific settings through commonly-used security cameras or webcams, or by purposefully placing video recorders, E-VIP will be capable of ongoing assessment which will inform public health surveillance, intervention, and evidence-based decision making (e.g., optimizing intervention strategies, monitoring school Physical Education mandates, providing needs assessment prior to and evaluation after environmental modifications).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will develop and test a software for automated ongoing measurement of use and physical activity intensity from video recordings in specific settings such as parks, schools (including Physical Education), and youth sports. This innovative software will support adaptive multilevel interventions and evidence-based decision making in physical activity-relevant settings to optimize strategies for improving population health.                ",Automated Ecological Video Identification of Physical Activity (E-VIP) Software,9035822,R21CA194492,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physical Education', 'Physical Education and Training', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Premature Mortality', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Security', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Sports', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'disorder control', 'disorder prevention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'population health', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary', 'software systems', 'teacher', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,"CHILDREN'S MERCY HOSP (KANSAS CITY, MO)",R21,2016,199277,0.0035962326281666884
"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.        ",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9102441,R01MH059929,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Exposure to', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'information processing', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'pre-clinical', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'symptomatology', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,740993,-0.008834772455466159
"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This large-scale study will advance the field by studying these different outcomes at their most basic functional level, and by identifying the biological mechanisms through which these specific types of distress and dysfunction develop.",Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes,9174752,U01MH110925,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Department evaluation', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychophysics', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'biobehavior', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'minor depressive disorder', 'molecular marker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'response', 'success', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2016,3940345,-0.029619085310614534
"Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People facing serious health threats increasingly use the Internet to obtain information and support. Internet support groups (ISGs), online communities where people come together to exchange information and/or support, are an important resource for patients grappling with serious medical conditions. Participation in health-related ISGs has been associated with significant reductions in participant-reported depression, anxiety and other indicators of psychological distress. These groups offer great potential for interventions that are highly scalable and yet easily tailored to individual needs. Unfortunately many ISG members leave too soon to benefit. In addition, there is limited scientific understanding of the active ingredients underlying the benefits that ISGs confer among their members. The proposed research uses state-of-the art machine learning and automated language analysis techniques to assess the types of interactions in online health support groups that lead to improved psychosocial well-being and health-related quality of life and how these interactions develop. It also uses these technologies and insight from our empirical research to build, deploy, and evaluate interventions that improve the interactions in health-related Internet support groups. Our work has three major aims. In Aims 1 and 2, we will analyze data from two complementary Internet support groups to identify (a) the communication processes that sustain participant engagement in the group and (b) the communication processes through which peer-to-peer interactions improve participants' psychosocial outcomes. These datasets come from an ongoing naturalistic study of 4,400 cancer survivors and caregivers in ISGs hosted by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and from a soon-to-be-completed NIMH-funded randomized trial (MH093501) assessing the effectiveness of an ISG for depressed and anxious patients referred to the group by their primary care physicians. Both datasets include participant-level data on depression, anxiety, stress and other psychosocial outcomes and detailed server logs containing information on page views, time on site, and the content of communications between participants. In Aim 3, we will develop and pilot test interventions to encourage the communication processes identified as effective in Aims 1 and 2. We will test whether mood, satisfaction with interactions and engagement in the group increase following interventions that (a) increase participants' receipt of individualized support from others; (b) provide participants with opportunities to offer support to others; (c) facilitate participants' expression of emotions; and (d) help participants form relationships with similar peers. In a series of randomized experiments, we will examine how these interventions affect participants' communication behaviors as well as short-term engagement and satisfaction with their online interactions. Results from this project will facilitate the development of an R01 application for a randomized clinical trial testing the impact of personalized ISG interventions on the length of time participants continue to participate in ISGs and participants' depression, anxiety and other psychosocial outcomes as well as healthcare utilization. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will examine how social exchanges among members of online health support groups lead to improvements in participants' health-related quality of life. Our findings will clarify the mechanisms through which social support leads to improved health-related quality of life and the process by which support resources are produced. The automated techniques we use to measure the exchange of support resources will also be the basis for interventions designed to make these exchanges more efficient and effective by matching people seeking support with those who can offer the type of support they need.",Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health,9039666,R21MH106880,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empirical Research', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Support Groups', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'communication behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'language processing', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'online community', 'peer', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'success', 'therapy design']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,192605,-0.036710403664188915
"Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia Project Summary ""Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention in Schizophrenia”  Schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating disorders in the world today. It affects over 2.4 million adult Americans each year. NIMH director Dr. Thomas Insel has declared “The best chance for preventing serious functional disability among people with schizophrenia may be to intervene at the earliest stages of the disorder, at the first episode of psychosis or even before symptoms appear. However, to act before symptoms appear requires improved predictive capacity” (NIMH 2011 Budget). Creating tools to identify high-risk, `prodromal' individuals may be the single most important step towards developing effective interventions to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), and thereby also reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown that over 54% of individuals with schizophrenia are re-hospitalized within the first 12 months following their initial hospitalization. Even after the first hospitalization, preventing relapse and re-hospitalization may lessen the long-term severity of the illness. In this SBIR Phase I study, we propose to determine the feasibility of screening for prodromal individuals and individuals at high risk of relapse by applying interpretive algorithms to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD). We hypothesize that PGMSD can effectively assist in screening for prodromal individuals who are progressing toward psychosis as well as for remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP).  In Phase I, we plan to recruit 70 individuals who have been or are being evaluated at the Prodromal clinics at Columbia, UCSD, and UCLA, where an estimated 70 to 90% of clients already own Smartphones. Data gathered may include: the frequency of telephone calls, emails, and texts, to assess within person changes in social connectedness; GPS, accelerometer data, to assess physical activity, isolation, and sleep patterns. In the past, several IRB-approved studies have used smartphones for gathering similar data from patients. Algorithms will be developed using several techniques including machine learning to convert the meta-level data into measures of social functioning, physical isolation, physical activity, and sleep/wake reversals. In addition to achieving technological success, our goal in Phase I is to provide evidence of our ability to use PGMSD algorithms to differentiating group means of participants who are controls, prodromal, or experiencing their FEP (SIPS 1 or 2; 3, 4, or 5; or 6).  In Phase II, we will further develop and validate these algorithms. If successful, the Phase II project will have a large and sustained impact as our algorithms will help (1) identify at-risk individuals who `are' or `are not' progressing toward conversion, (2) serve as an objective measure of treatment effectiveness; (3) give rise to clinical reports delivered to EHR systems that hold promise for preventing relapse during the critical 12 months after initial diagnosis, potentially reducing hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. Project Narrative The proposed research protocol seeks to determine the feasibility of identifying individuals progressing toward a first psychotic episode or re-hospitalization by applying interpretive algorithms developed in part using machine learning to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD) collected from the smartphones of 70 participants ages 18-30. If successful, the PGMSD-derived algorithms will assist in screening for prodromal individuals progressing toward psychosis as well as with remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP), potentially decrease hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. This passive data gathering approach will augment existing active data collection approaches, aid clinicians in focusing on interpreting rather than gathering data from their clients, and could modify clinical paradigms by shifting treatment from individuals suffering from Schizophrenia to individuals who are at risk of developing psychosis with the goal of achieving `secondary' and eventually `primary' prevention.",Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia,9201713,R43MH107097,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Incipient Schizophrenia', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupational', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Poverty', 'Primary Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Universities', 'Work', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'information gathering', 'insight', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prevent', 'programs', 'real world application', 'relapse risk', 'screening', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R43,2016,366201,-0.023274408751362365
"Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity is associated with high financial cost and increased morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Health care spending due to obesity is estimated to be as high as \$210 billion annually, or 21\% of total national spending. A childhood obesity surveillance system will discern disparities, detect aberrant signals, design targeted interventions, and track change over time. In addition to national public health surveillance systems, local data are increasingly necessary to reflect regional trends. Current systems in Wisconsin are subject to (1) bias estimation of obesity rates, (2) limited data in school-aged children ages 5-10 years, (3) insufficient power to estimate disparities in local subgroups, and (4) limited ability to track local changes over time. Therefore, the impact of investments and collective efforts in Wisconsin childhood obesity prevention has been difficult to measure. This, in turn, demands approaches that overcome and transcend the posited limitations. Since large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, there has been a paradigm shift and accelerated improvements in the use of EHR data for the purpose of population health promotion and tracking of progress. The University of Wisconsin Population Health Information Exchange (PHINEX) database contains de- identified EHR data from a multicenter healthcare system located primarily in south central Wisconsin. In partnership with The Wisconsin Obesity Prevention Initiative, we aim to create an EHR model for a childhood obesity prevention surveillance system. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods using the platform of PHINEX for childhood obesity prevention purposes. This enhance and extend surveillance activities of childhood obesity conditions, and increase the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions aimed at changing policies, systems, and environments associated with childhood obesity. We plan to address the following aims: (1) robust estimation of the spatiotemporal prevalence at area level, (2) hot spot detection on areas with aberrant obesity incidence, and (3) prediction for childhood weight gain phenotypes. The developed and implemented surveillance system can benefit future planning, legislation and implementation in other states and/or surveillance of other acute and chronic health conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood obesity has emerged as a leading health concern in the 21st century. Current data sources from which childhood obesity estimates are derived in most systems are primarily cross-sectional, are from small sample sizes, and/or have limited generalizability. Large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, which provide unprecedented opportunities for individual and population health surveillance. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods to increase the use of large EHR data for childhood obesity prevention purposes, extending the scope of public health surveillance.            ",Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data,9018958,R21HD086754,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family Practice', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hot Spot', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'School-Age Population', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smiling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data structure', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'population based', 'population health', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'user friendly software']",NICHD,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R21,2016,234419,-0.02925916145944903
"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home. This project will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to biological outcomes such as insulin resistance.",(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk,9132699,R01CA179977,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Calories', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Code', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'High Fat Diet', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Income', 'Inflammation', 'Information Systems', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recreation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Self Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'built environment', 'cancer risk', 'collaborative environment', 'demographics', 'density', 'fast food', 'food environment', 'good diet', 'inflammatory marker', 'land use', 'learned behavior', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'obesogenic', 'physical inactivity', 'residence', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sugar', 'tv watching', 'walkability']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,816993,-0.013021210952540793
"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",9123674,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'CNR2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'data to knowledge', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'traumatic event', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2016,165886,-0.0021411032893043414
"A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade has seen explosive growth of online social networks (OSNs), which are now a pervasive part of everyday life for many people. ""Big data"" analyses of OSNs have enormous potential to enable new discoveries and applications in public health. For example we may soon be able to study how mental health indicators vary over time and between communities and regions; how major events like disasters and mass shootings affect community mental health; and potentially even use social media for individual-level screening and diagnosis. But in order to do this effectively, psychologists need to know how to make sense of vast amounts of digital records of raw behavior. That will require interdisciplinary collaborations between psychology and computer science to create new tools and methods for automated analyses of mental health variables in large and complex datasets. The goal of this project is to develop new metrics for doing large-scale, ""big data"" mental health research on Twitter, a popular online social network service with a large and diverse user base in the United States that makes most user-generated content publicly available. We are particularly interested in how Twitter data can be used to draw inferences about users' personality traits (which are indicative of risk and vulnerability), emotions, and clinical symptoms. To date, researchers studying mental health on Twitter have focused on a small number of metrics which often differ from study to study and are not always well-validated. We do not yet have a unified, comprehensive understanding of how mental health characteristics can be measured and studied online. Our project has three goals. First, we will gather data from a very large, representative sample of American Twitter users to map out what meaningful metrics can be derived from Twitter data. What can be reliably measured, and how are different kinds of metrics related to each other? By studying relationships and overlaps among these variables, we expect to identify a key set of online metrics that can be used to characterize important psychological differences among users. Second, we will recruit a sample of Twitter users to complete standardized assessments of personality, emotion, and clinical symptoms. We will look to see what kinds of online behaviors are reliable and valid markers of these psychological variables. Third, to demonstrate the utility of these markers we will monitor millions of Twitter accounts around the country for one year to measure how one specific kind of community trauma, mass shootings, affects indicators of personality, emotion, and mental health. We expect to find effects of such events on the online expression of emotion and clinical symptoms immediately following an event, and perhaps longer-term effects that endure beyond the immediate aftermath. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to identify important markers of personality, emotion, and mental health in Twitter data. This will be useful to researchers who want to use ""big data"" approaches to study mental health, and to policy applications to study individual or regional variations and reactions to events.","A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter",9132357,R21MH106879,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disasters', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Negative Valence', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Personality Traits', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structural Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'digital', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'member', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'study characteristics', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2016,172209,-0.02617215578018739

"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,9069515,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'novel therapeutics', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2016,176472,-0.010935339592609184

"Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the “Alcoa Study” remains the development of increasingly rich models to explain the disparate health and work-capacity trajectories demonstrated in this universally insured, geographically, socially and economically diverse cohort of 200,000+ men and women as they progress from work-life into retirement. Outcomes of focus remain incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. Our unique data set has been augmented to include early life social context via Census data; personal and family work experience and income across the life span via IRS and SSA; post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI) and contextual social environment from lifetime residential geocoding. Consequently, we propose in the next cycle to embrace a life course approach to study the social, environmental and behavioral determinants of the outcomes listed above The specific aims of this grant are: Aim 1: Link Alcoa workers to individual census records to examine how early life environment influences later life health outcomes. Aim 2: Assess the impact on health and function of adverse working environment as it accrues during work-life, with an emphasis on ubiquitous physical hazards. Aim 3: Identify antecedents of short-term and long-term disability across working life as candidates for subsequent hypothesis testing. Aim 4: Assess the impact disability benefits have on employee work function and health. Aim 5: Examine how injuries and health shocks affect retirement savings and subsequent health trajectories. Viewed altogether, continuation of the Alcoa study with the assembled team of investigators provides an unparalleled opportunity to address a host of critical empiric and methodologic issues previously unapproachable. In addition to understanding better which occupational exposures contribute to chronic disease and disability, these data will allow us to control for economic and other contextual factors to an extraordinary degree. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Alcoa research infrastructure—linking quantitative exposure measures to myriad hazards of active workers whose behavior, social environment and health status from pre-employment through retirement to death are fully observed—provides a unique opportunity to extend our work on the our outcomes of focus including incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to early life social context, personal and family work experience and income and post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI).","Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce",9345124,R56AG026291,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Disability Insurance', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Conditions', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Occupational Health', 'Outcome', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Price', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Shock', 'Social Environment', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disability impact', 'experience', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'uptake']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2016,1154772,-0.03707580067151097

"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,9133378,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall injury', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'stroke survivor', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2016,166809,-0.0024934818608575407
"Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD The identification of neurobiological markers associated with childhood status and persistence vs. remission of the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) over development, and the translation of these markers into more effective diagnosis and intervention strategies are major priorities of NIMH. The persistence of ADHD into adulthood in many but not all afflicted children attests to the considerable variability in the remission of symptoms over development. However, evidence of cortical and subcortical structural anomalies associated with the persistence versus remission of ADHD is relatively limited, and not fully consistent. [Our group is in a unique position to test the neurobiological mechanisms associated with the childhood status and the developmental trajectories of ADHD]. We recently completed a 15-year longitudinal study of ADHD that recruited and clinically followed a large sample of children with ADHD into adulthood, as well as a well- matched sample of never ADHD controls that was recruited in adolescence and followed into adulthood. This large sample represents the diversity of outcomes characteristic of ADHD and was scanned with multi-modal neuroimaging in adulthood. Published results of our functional neuroimaging study support the distinction in neural mechanisms associated with the emergence and remission of ADHD. Young adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were marked by reduced regardless of adult outcome, while the remission of ADHD symptoms in adulthood was associated with enhanced cue-related thalamo-prefrontal functional connectivity. [However, the neuroanatomical evidence of this double-dissociation model of ADHD emergence and remission has not yet been investigated cue-related thalamus activation and functional connectivity with brainstem . By capitalizing on the availability of both neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical data from our recently completed study and utilizing advanced neuroimaging analysis and multivariate machine leaning techniques, this proposal aims to identify the neuroanatomical correlates of childhood status and remission of ADHD in young adults, and to link the anatomical evidence with the functional and longitudinal clinical evidence associated with persistent vs. remitted ADHD. The ultimate goal is to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into clinically applicable biomarkers that can guide individualized interventions in youth with ADHD.] Our central hypotheses are that: (1) childhood ADHD is associated with thalamo-brainstem structural disconnectivity that endures into adulthood regardless of the developmental trajectory of the disorder; and (2) diminution of symptoms is related to optimal prefrontal development and its anatomical connectivity with other brain regions. The ultimate goal of this proposal is innovative and directly relevant to the NIMH mission, to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into more clinically applicable biomarkers that can serve as targets for the development of interventions in youth with ADHD. NARRATIVE Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent within the general population, with significant cognitive impairments that can exist throughout the lifespan. This project aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with the persistence vs. remission of ADHD.

"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9197901,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Proxy', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'trafficking', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,199585,-0.0014970321830391502
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9134892,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2016,563079,-0.023927017851148636
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.            ",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9027247,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Figs - dietary', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Staging', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward processing', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,1364412,-0.04695202770140751
"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",9115219,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'exercise intolerance', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,1900214,-0.01996860823493075
"A Direct Reading Video Assessment Instrument for Repetitive Motion Stress Project Summary/ Abstract This research studies if computer vision can more effectively evaluate worker exposure and assess the associated risk for work related injuries than conventional methods. Current methods involve either observations or measurements using instruments attached to a worker's hands or arms. Observation is often considered too subjective or inaccurate, and instruments too invasive or time consuming for routine applications in industry. Automated job analysis potentially offers a more objective, accurate, repeatable, and efficient exposure assessment tool than observational analysis. Computer vision uses less resources than instruments attached to workers and does not interfere with production; can quantify more exposure variables and interactions; is suitable for long-term, direct reading exposure assessment; and offers animated data visualizations synchronized with video for identifying aspects of jobs needing interventions. This research leverages the research from coordinated multi-institutional prospective studies of upper limb work related MSD conducted between 2001 and 2010 that studied production and service workers from a variety of US industries, and used rigorous case-criteria and individual-level exposure assessments prospectively, including recording detailed videos of the work. Our study partners from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Washington State Labor & Industries Safety & Health Assessment & Research for Prevention program and the University of California-San Francisco will provide task-level videos, associated exposure variable data, and prospective health outcomes for 1,649 workers. Exposure properties directly measured from videos of jobs and corresponding health outcomes from the prospective study database will establish dose-response relationships to translate into a prototype automated job analysis instrument. We build on our previous success in developing video marker-less hand motion algorithms for estimating the ACGIH hand activity level, and reliable video processing methods for hand tracking under challenging viewing conditions. This proposal will refine and develop additional video algorithms, and analyze the videos to extract exposure measures for repetition, posture, exertions, and their interactions. The video extracted exposure measures will be compared against conventional observational exposure measures made by our collaborators. Video and corresponding observational data will be merged with the prospective health outcomes data to evaluate dose-response and to develop and validate parsimonious exposure risk models for an automated direct reading repetitive motion instrument. We will test if automation has better predictive capability than observation and also consider the accuracy and utility of computer vision analysis against conventional job analysis for selected industrial jobs. This proposal addresses the NIOSH cross-sector programs in Musculoskeletal Disorders as well as in Exposure Assessment.

"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life.

"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,9049546,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Theory of Change', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'concept mapping', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'data access', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health service use', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'medication compliance', 'mobile computing', 'monitoring device', 'mood symptom', 'new technology', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'reduce symptoms', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,564995,-0.02439579287899957
"Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Background and goals: Each year in the US, up to 490,000 pregnant women undergo elective induction, an intervention to bring on labor without a medical reason. Whether this causes risks to the woman or fetus is unclear. Only one recent clinical trial studied elective induction before 41 weeks of fetal gestation, and it found no difference in outcomes compared to letting the pregnancy continue (expectant management). Observational studies have found more cesarean delivery after induction, but most compared induction to spontaneous labor at the same gestational age, which is not the genuine clinical alternative. Instead, elective induction should be compared to the true alternative, expectant management. Most studies were too small to study uncommon but important outcomes, and none looked at whether risks differ by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. Our goal is to compare outcomes for elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management, to help pregnant women and their providers make more informed decisions. Methods: A multiphase retrospective study of births from 2001 to 2011 will be conducted in two integrated health care systems. In Phase 1, the eligible population (206,000 singleton births) will be identified and classified by their apparent induction and outcome status based on electronic health plan and birth certificate data. In Phase 2, we will conduct 8000 brief medical record reviews to determine true exposure status (elective induction vs. expectant management). In Phase 3, we will review 3500 records in depth for true outcome status and risk factors. Phases 2 and 3 will oversample women with elective induction or rare outcomes, improving our power to address these specific aims: Aim 1: Compare the risk of the following outcomes after elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management: cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, neonatal intensive care unit stay, shoulder dystocia, low Apgar score, stillbirth, and neonatal death; and Aim 2: Examine how risks vary by the mother's race/ethnicity, parity, and pre-pregnancy obesity. Secondary analyses will develop an algorithm to more accurately identify elective inductions from electronic data. Impact: This research will compare elective labor induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation to expectant management to provide new information about its risks or benefits for the mother and fetus. Our results could immediately affect clinical practice by helping women and providers make more informed choices together. They will also provide a solid foundation for practice guidelines and policy making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many pregnant women undergo elective induction (bringing on labor without a medical reason), but there is little good information about whether this is risk for the mother or fetus. Few studies have compared elective induction to the true alternative, letting the pregnancy continue, with birth at a later date; and it is not known whether risks diffe by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. The study would fill these critical knowledge gaps, and findings could immediately shape clinical practice.",Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes,9069491,R01HD071986,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Cesarean section', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Dystocia', 'Electronics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Fetus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Services Research', 'Infant Health', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Physician&apos', 's Practice Patterns', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Solid', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'Wing', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'electronic data', 'fetal', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intraamniotic infection', 'neonatal death', 'neonatal outcome', 'parity', 'pregnant', 'stillbirth', 'tool', 'trend']",NICHD,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,654513,-0.010377296337809105
"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,9144793,R03OH010956,[' '],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2016,66564,-0.00799643647554177
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults. This is relevant to the part of NIH's mission which focuses on the prevention of disease by supporting research in the diagnosis of human diseases.            ",Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment,9082891,R01DK109008,"['Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Body measure procedure', 'Classification', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gender', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insulin Resistance', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated disease', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Self Assessment', 'Shapes', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Video Games', 'Visceral', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disorder prevention', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'insulin sensitivity', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'optical imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'sex', 'subcutaneous', 'tool', 'waist circumference', 'whole body imaging']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,706716,0.011312998482244508
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.

"Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone mass and structural deterioration leading to increased risk of fracture. Currently, osteoporosis is diagnosed by measurement of areal bone mineral density by dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, the majority of fractures occur in both women and men who are not classified as osteoporotic by current DXA criteria (T-score = -2.5). As a 2-dimensional (2D) technology, DXA does not provide information about 3-dimensional (3D) bone structure, shape and geometry, which substantially contribute to bone strength and resistance to fracture. Finite element (FE) analysis of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images can provide 3D structure and strength measurements but QCT is impractical for widespread clinical use because of high radiation exposure and expense. In contrast, DXA is widely available, inexpensive and has low radiation exposure. What is needed is a method by which DXA images can be used to generate 3D shape models that incorporate bone structure and geometry. However, fractures are complex events influenced by other factors including age, race, body mass index, risk of falls, and prior medical and fracture history. Even sophisticated measurements of bone density, structure, and strength may not be able to predict fractures accurately. Machine learning is an emerging field in which models are created by ""learning"" from previous data. These models can incorporate various factors and be used to classify or predict outcomes for new data. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that advanced analyses of widely available DXA images that incorporate structural and strength information and statistical modeling using machine learning to incorporate additional risk factors will better identify patient at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. This hypothesis will be tested using QCT and DXA data from previous studies to generate 3D statistical shape models that describe variability in proximal femur morphology. By aligning 2D DXA images to the models, patient-specific 3D models will be reconstructed for quantitative analyses and combined with FE analysis to estimate bone strength. Machine learning models will be used to incorporate these novel measurements, demographics, and various risk factors for fracture to predict incident fractures in two very large, prospective studies. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to increase the diagnostic utility of DXA, a safe, non-invasive, and widely available technology, by applying novel image processing and statistical techniques to predict fractures more accurately.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 are destined to suffer an osteoporotic fracture during their remaining lifetime. Unfortunately, the current standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, DXA, does not predict most fractures. This research will develop advanced analyses of DXA images and use machine learning to improve individualized fracture risk assessment.            ",Fracture Prediction by Machine Learning and 3D Finite Element Models from DXA,8869145,K99AR067883,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'American', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Cadaver', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Height', 'Hip Fractures', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Osteopenia', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Postmenopause', 'Prospective Studies', 'Race', 'Radiation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'bone geometry', 'bone mass', 'bone strength', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'diagnosis standard', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'men', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2015,91800,-0.018366631481957163
"Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess body fat is a key underlying factor in the development of numerous chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA recently declared that obesity, itself, is a disease. Most epidemiologic studies utilize Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify people as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese because it is a convenient and simple method that has been shown to correlate with disease risk. Since the majority of the health risks associated with obesity are more directly linked to an overabundance of body fat than weight, measuring body fat is essential for more precise guidelines. However, accurate methods of assessing body fat are expensive, inconvenient, and require immobile equipment. Consequently, the AMA has called for more cost effective and convenient methods to assess body composition to assist doctors in their assessment and treatment. Virtual modeling of humans in particular has provided ways to scan and analyze the body and its motion. Supervised Machine Learning (SML), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, has made great progress in taking measured data to infer new relationships. It is our belief that virtual modeling and SML can provide the techniques necessary to conveniently and accurately calculate the percentage of body fat (%BF) and to provide new tools in treating obesity based on body shapes. The project will develop a system that uses commercially available depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect(r) to capture the surface of the human body. This will be accomplished by developing a new algorithm to perform deformable registration of several RGB-Depth views of the body. A new algorithm that uses SML will be developed to calculate percentage body fat using the surface data. The system will be trained and validated by collecting data from a number of subjects. The surface captured will be used to explore the role of visual body representation in motivation and adherence. The developed systems can be implemented in clinical or personal settings and be utilized as a public health research tool and deployed widely given the low-cost of the hardware required. In addition to the immediate impact that the system will have on managing obesity, the project will have a broad impact on a number of areas. A large database of such shapes captured over time may lead to ways to predict how an individual's body shape will change given a particular intervention. Certain medical conditions that result in body shape change, such as those involving lymphatic circulations, may be diagnosed and tracked more easily. Growth patterns of children may be tracked by change of body shapes. Further research can be conducted to determine the effect of body shape on %BF using data mining techniques.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop a new method to capture the 3D surface and shape of a human body and a new method to use these data to calculate percent body fat. By making these tools widely available and economical, the proposed approach has the potential for major contributions in the assessment and treatment of obesity.        ",Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models,8970310,R21HL124443,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Belief', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body Surface', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equipment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Muscle', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plethysmography', 'Population Study', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Self Perception', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weights and Measures', 'base', 'body density', 'body volume', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder risk', 'lymphatic circulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'tool', 'virtual', 'weight loss intervention']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,227680,0.0032267807421760605
"Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines continued collaboration between the Malaria Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Malaria Epidemiology Section of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support CDC partners in malaria endemic countries in the conduct of collaborative research to improve the control of malaria in Africa and in Indonesia and to coordinate international research initiatives for malaria control. LSTM, on behalf of the Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) Consortium, will coordinate research strategy development between CDC and other International partners in Europe, Australia and endemic countries for future studies of the control of malaria in pregnancy. In addition, a range of research projects will be conducted jointly between LSTM, CDC and the overseas partners of CDC in Indonesia (the Eijkman Institute, Jakarta) and in western Kenya (KEMRI-CDC field station). These fall under three main objectives: malaria control; malaria in pregnancy; and integrated disease control, following the outline of the original call. Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology. LSTM will also continue to provide technical advice to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Roll Back Malaria (RBM) in support of scaling up of malaria control interventions globally.

"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety and mood disorders (internalizing disorders [IDs]) are common and debilitating conditions. The proposed Career Development Award will provide the candidate with the necessary skills to develop an independent research program focused on identifying how psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities predict the development and course of IDs using prospective observational survey designs. The applicant's prior research training involved studying the influence of psychological/personality vulnerabilities on ID severity and course in patient samples. In order to expand his research program, the applicant is seeking advanced training in two key areas (psychiatric epidemiology; machine learning methods) and supplemental training in two additional areas (self-assessed biomarkers; environmental vulnerabilities). Collectively, this training will provide the applicant with the skills (1) to study ID onset and course using prospective survey designs, and (2) to use machine learning methods to develop clinically-useful risk algorithms of ID onset and course using multiple vulnerability domains (psychological/ personality; environmental; biomarker). These skills will be developed through a combination of didactic training, guided readings, and mentored research projects. Training will occur in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School under the mentoring of Dr. Ronald Kessler (an expert in psychiatric epidemiology) and Dr. Sherri Rose (an expert in machine learning). The proposed research plan involves two phases. In Phase 1, machine learning methods will be used to analyze cross-sectional ID data from the World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in order to develop risk algorithms that predict the onset of major depression, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (Specific Aim 1). Machine learning methods will also be applied to WMH Survey data to develop subtypes of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder that maximize the prediction of their long-term course (Specific Aim 2). The proposed Phase 1 studies are highly innovative; in contrast to other areas of medicine, virtually no studies have attempted to develop ID risk algorithms or subtypes using machine learning methods. However, Phase 1 studies are also preliminary; replication and expansion of the algorithms is needed in prospective samples. Accordingly, Phase 2 of the research plan (Specific Aim 3) aims to test the feasibility of conducting a large prospective web-based survey study of psychological/personality (assessed via self-report and behavior), environmental (assessed via self-report), and biomarker (assessed via self-administered salivary assays) vulnerabilities of ID onset and course. Participants will be recruited online to complete a baseline survey and those determined to have an ID or be at high-risk of developing an ID will be asked to complete bimonthly follow-ups over the course of one year. The Phase 2 study is also innovative. Despite being called ""the future"" of epidemiological research, web-based survey studies of the IDs are rare. In addition, existing prospective epidemiological studies coarsely (i.e., dichotomously) assess IDs and their vulnerabilities, and have long gaps (1-4 years) between follow-ups. The use of bimonthly online surveys of the severity of IDs and their vulnerabilities will address these limitations. Phase 2 exploratory analyses will also be conduct in which latent ID trajectories are predicted using machine learning methods. Overall, the outlined training activities and mentored research projects will be used to develop an R01 application for a prospective epidemiological study that uses machine learning methods to develop clinically useful algorithms of ID onset and course using a broad range of psychological/personality, environmental, and biomarker vulnerabilities factors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities.

"Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in five adults in the U.S. are thought to be living with a disability, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting physical movement patterns. Medical care costs related to disability in the US exceed $300 billion annually. Regular physical activity (PA) represents an important modifiable behavior to improve the overall health of these disabled groups and to realize their movement potential. Substantial progress has been made in developing and testing wearable monitor calibrations to predict physical activity (PA) level and type. However, little scientific attention has been given to develop methods to assess PA in disabled populations. The aims of this application focus on filling this scientific knowledge gap. Specific Aim 1) To measure impairment and function to provide a movement disorder analysis of: a) no movement limitation; b) upper extremity limitation; c) lower extremity limitation, or d) both upper and lower extremity limitation. Specific Aim 2) To measure bilateral wrist, hip, and ankle acceleration to conditionally model metabolic cost and activity type estimates. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by first carrying out a multitude of advanced upper and lower body strength, coordination, and functional motor tasks to isolate key impairment and function limitations across a diverse population with movement pattern differences. Then using an unsupervised learning and cluster analysis approach we will use these data to evaluate a fast, convenient, and simple metric to categorize functional movement pattern differences. We will assess criterion energy cost and multiple hip and limb acceleration during an extensive battery of activities of daily living, to guide the development of single or combined wearable motion sensor algorithms across categories of functional movement groups using advanced analytical techniques. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to both categorize and assess PA in persons with movement limitations. This will present the foundation to evaluate a decision-tree approach to guide both monitor placement and algorithm choice to assess PA in diverse populations. Ultimately, our work will provide the potential to precisely and accurately assess PA prevalence rates, effectiveness of behavior-based PA interventions, and PA dose-response relationships to prevent and manage disabling conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) in populations with disability is essential to determine the effectiveness of behaviorally based PA interventions, and further our understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health in these groups.

"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8849802,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,156324,-0.016794500334877237
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,8917308,R01NS086885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'Amnesia', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iraq', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Moods', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'executive function', 'gray matter', 'inattention', 'interest', 'meetings', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'response', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,347813,-0.017444267696380942
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,8896079,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'human Huntingtin protein', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2015,339691,-0.013301844322506143
"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed. The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.",Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit,8840546,R01CA164993,"['Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Bicycling', 'Cancer Control', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Housekeeping', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Life', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marshal', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'computerized data processing', 'epidemiologic data', 'improved', 'intervention effect', 'novel', 'sedentary', 'sensor', 'temporal measurement', 'vector']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,536065,0.0023635958593534977
"Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People facing serious health threats increasingly use the Internet to obtain information and support. Internet support groups (ISGs), online communities where people come together to exchange information and/or support, are an important resource for patients grappling with serious medical conditions. Participation in health-related ISGs has been associated with significant reductions in participant-reported depression, anxiety and other indicators of psychological distress. These groups offer great potential for interventions that are highly scalable and yet easily tailored to individual needs. Unfortunately many ISG members leave too soon to benefit. In addition, there is limited scientific understanding of the active ingredients underlying the benefits that ISGs confer among their members. The proposed research uses state-of-the art machine learning and automated language analysis techniques to assess the types of interactions in online health support groups that lead to improved psychosocial well-being and health-related quality of life and how these interactions develop. It also uses these technologies and insight from our empirical research to build, deploy, and evaluate interventions that improve the interactions in health-related Internet support groups. Our work has three major aims. In Aims 1 and 2, we will analyze data from two complementary Internet support groups to identify (a) the communication processes that sustain participant engagement in the group and (b) the communication processes through which peer-to-peer interactions improve participants' psychosocial outcomes. These datasets come from an ongoing naturalistic study of 4,400 cancer survivors and caregivers in ISGs hosted by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and from a soon-to-be-completed NIMH-funded randomized trial (MH093501) assessing the effectiveness of an ISG for depressed and anxious patients referred to the group by their primary care physicians. Both datasets include participant-level data on depression, anxiety, stress and other psychosocial outcomes and detailed server logs containing information on page views, time on site, and the content of communications between participants. In Aim 3, we will develop and pilot test interventions to encourage the communication processes identified as effective in Aims 1 and 2. We will test whether mood, satisfaction with interactions and engagement in the group increase following interventions that (a) increase participants' receipt of individualized support from others; (b) provide participants with opportunities to offer support to others; (c) facilitate participants' expression of emotions; and (d) help participants form relationships with similar peers. In a series of randomized experiments, we will examine how these interventions affect participants' communication behaviors as well as short-term engagement and satisfaction with their online interactions. Results from this project will facilitate the development of an R01 application for a randomized clinical trial testing the impact of personalized ISG interventions on the length of time participants continue to participate in ISGs and participants' depression, anxiety and other psychosocial outcomes as well as healthcare utilization.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will examine how social exchanges among members of online health support groups lead to improvements in participants' health-related quality of life. Our findings will clarify the mechanisms through which social support leads to improved health-related quality of life and the process by which support resources are produced. The automated techniques we use to measure the exchange of support resources will also be the basis for interventions designed to make these exchanges more efficient and effective by matching people seeking support with those who can offer the type of support they need.            ",Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health,8873740,R21MH106880,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empirical Research', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Support Groups', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'communication behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'language processing', 'member', 'peer', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'success', 'therapy design']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,231129,-0.036710403664188915
"Development of real-time, automated 3D ultrasound tools for the study of placental invasion and morphology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Among the most intractable pregnancy pathologies are those related to aberrant trophoblast invasion and the subsequent remodeling of maternal vasculature at the utero-placental interface (UPI). These include preeclampsia (PE), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and abnormally invasive placenta (AIP, aka placenta accreta). Despite this, tools to measure placental structure and function in the crucial late first to early second trimester period have yet to be developed that can be translated from the research environment to routine clinical use. We are now constructing 3D power Doppler ultrasound technologies that provide real-time, quantitative assessment of placental structural and vascular development. We have developed novel semi- automated methods for calculation of placental volume (PlaV) and new methods to measure gross placental morphology (GPM; dimensions, surface area etc.) and to assess the vasculature at the UPI (Fractional Moving Blood Volume, FMBV). We propose four Aims intended to move the field towards routine imaging of placental structure and function in real time and to generate clinically useful tests for monitoring significant placental pathologies. In Aim 1, using machine learning techniques and an extant database of ~2800 1st trimester placental scans, we will fully automate the novel tools developed for measurement of PlaV into a real-time analytical package. Aim 2 will focus on 3D ultrasound techniques to interrogate the vasculature at the UPI through refinement of our new method for determining FMBV, a quantitative measure of vascularity. This will lead to a tool that can assess the entire UPI, a major site of pathology in PE, IUGR and AIP. We also aim to develop 3D power Doppler ultrasound tools for the examination of the size and distribution of the spiral artery jets feeding the intervillous space, enabling us to explore normal and pathological development of the intervillous supply in real-time. Aims 3 and 4 are prospective validation studies designed to test the utility of the tools described above. Aim 3 extends our recently published study of over-invasion of the maternal vasculature to the 1 /2 trimester. The presence and severity of AIP is assessed using Acon, the largest area of standard 3D power Doppler signal at the UPI. Under-invasion will be addressed via analysis of prospectively collected 11-13 week 3D-PD scans in women who develop PE. We will compare PlaV, GPM, FMBV and spiral artery jets in normotensive and preeclamptic pregnancies. The prospective study in Aim 4 will address the environmental impact of smoking by comparing structural and vascular parameters between smokers and non-smokers at weekly intervals from 8-18 wks. These powerful longitudinal studies will map the development of morphologic and vascular features in smokers and non-smokers and provide new insights into the factors responsible for smoking-induced growth restriction. The strong investigative team, composed of bioengineers, maternal-fetal medicine specialists and placental biologists, is delivering these new tools in the research setting and is poised to generate new methods for clinical measurement of placental structure and vascular function in real-time.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If the placenta does not develop normally, complications like poor fetal growth and preeclampsia in the mother occur. We are developing new ultrasound techniques to measure the placenta early in pregnancy. This could permit early detection of problems that occur months later in the pregnancy. This would allow doctors to monitor the pregnancy and to prevent or treat problems quickly, before they have serious effects on the fetus.        ","Development of real-time, automated 3D ultrasound tools for the study of placental invasion and morphology",9076751,U01HD087209,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decidua', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Doppler Ultrasound', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mothers', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Accreta', 'Placentation', 'Plant Roots', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Spiral Artery of the Endometrium', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Vascularization', 'Woman', 'feeding', 'fetal', 'fetal medicine', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'insight', 'model development', 'myometrium', 'non-smoker', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'trophoblast', 'validation studies']",NICHD,HACKENSACK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2015,3271021,-0.08122585593124833
"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home. This project will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to biological outcomes such as insulin resistance.",(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk,8906825,R01CA179977,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Calories', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Code', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Income', 'Inflammation', 'Information Systems', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recreation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Self Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'built environment', 'cancer risk', 'collaborative environment', 'demographics', 'density', 'fast food', 'food environment', 'good diet', 'inflammatory marker', 'land use', 'learned behavior', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'residence', 'sedentary', 'sugar', 'tv watching']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,751279,-0.013021210952540793
"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",8922958,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'CNR2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'traumatic event', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2015,166237,-0.0021411032893043414
"A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade has seen explosive growth of online social networks (OSNs), which are now a pervasive part of everyday life for many people. ""Big data"" analyses of OSNs have enormous potential to enable new discoveries and applications in public health. For example we may soon be able to study how mental health indicators vary over time and between communities and regions; how major events like disasters and mass shootings affect community mental health; and potentially even use social media for individual-level screening and diagnosis. But in order to do this effectively, psychologists need to know how to make sense of vast amounts of digital records of raw behavior. That will require interdisciplinary collaborations between psychology and computer science to create new tools and methods for automated analyses of mental health variables in large and complex datasets. The goal of this project is to develop new metrics for doing large-scale, ""big data"" mental health research on Twitter, a popular online social network service with a large and diverse user base in the United States that makes most user-generated content publicly available. We are particularly interested in how Twitter data can be used to draw inferences about users' personality traits (which are indicative of risk and vulnerability), emotions, and clinical symptoms. To date, researchers studying mental health on Twitter have focused on a small number of metrics which often differ from study to study and are not always well-validated. We do not yet have a unified, comprehensive understanding of how mental health characteristics can be measured and studied online. Our project has three goals. First, we will gather data from a very large, representative sample of American Twitter users to map out what meaningful metrics can be derived from Twitter data. What can be reliably measured, and how are different kinds of metrics related to each other? By studying relationships and overlaps among these variables, we expect to identify a key set of online metrics that can be used to characterize important psychological differences among users. Second, we will recruit a sample of Twitter users to complete standardized assessments of personality, emotion, and clinical symptoms. We will look to see what kinds of online behaviors are reliable and valid markers of these psychological variables. Third, to demonstrate the utility of these markers we will monitor millions of Twitter accounts around the country for one year to measure how one specific kind of community trauma, mass shootings, affects indicators of personality, emotion, and mental health. We expect to find effects of such events on the online expression of emotion and clinical symptoms immediately following an event, and perhaps longer-term effects that endure beyond the immediate aftermath.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to identify important markers of personality, emotion, and mental health in Twitter data. This will be useful to researchers who want to use ""big data"" approaches to study mental health, and to policy applications to study individual or regional variations and reactions to events.            ","A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter",8873743,R21MH106879,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disasters', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Negative Valence', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Personality Traits', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structural Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'digital', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'member', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'web-based social networking']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2015,203059,-0.02617215578018739
"Institutional Research Collaboration between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Centers for Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Project summary This is the 3rd, 5-year collaborative agreement between CDC's Malaria Branch and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). The proposed research strategy follows the objectives outlined in the FOA and involves 4 themes: a) Operational research (OR) related to malaria transmission reduction, b) OR to identify novel or improved interventions for children with severe malarial anaemia and pregnant women, c) Maximising the public health impact by supporting translation of global policies for the control of malaria in pregnancy to country level policies through information exchange (3.1), and d) Strengthening research capacity of the overseas partners in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia by provision of individual level PhD and post-doctoral studentships and group courses (5.1). Malaria transmission reduction OR activities take place under the umbrella of the long-term collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and CDC in Kenya. LSTM will work with CDC to provide technical support to KEMRI to build the information infrastructure needed to track malaria transmission intensity and progress towards malaria control targets, including the rational development of large-scale entomological monitoring systems in situations with declining vector densities, increased outdoor biting and vector resistance to the commonly used insecticides (1.1), support the development of enhanced semi-automated routine surveillance systems with scannable registers, and conduct continuous malaria indicator surveys for real- time monitoring of the case-burden and infection prevalence (4.1). LSTM will support CDC to develop the concept and seek funding for proof-of-principle studies that determine the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of mass-drug administration with antimalarials when combined with indoor residual spraying (2.1). It will support dose finding studies with primaquine and ivermectin that aim to identify adjunct therapies to enhance the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) (2.2), and support the economic evaluation of different interventions and surveillance methods as part of the transmission reduction activities (2.3). Studies in high risk groups includes research to improve adherence to malaria case-management guidelines in pregnancy in western Kenya (1.2) and three large multi-centre trials including one on the prevention of rebound admissions and deaths with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in children with severe anaemia in Kenya (2.4) and two on the control of malaria in pregnancy: STOPMiP-Indonesia (2.6), STOPMIP2 in Kenya and Malawi (2.5) evaluating the safety and efficacy of intermittent preventive therapy with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Project Narrative The aim of the proposed collaboration is to improve the use of existing interventions and to explore new ways to reduce the burden of malaria in high risk groups such as young children and pregnant women. In addition it aims to explore the effect of different combinations of area-wide interventions to reduce malaria transmission and to evaluate surveillance tools that can measure the beneficial impact on populations in terms of health, household level wealth and quality of health service delivery. These are high priority objectives of the partner institutions in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia and align with the objective of CDC's Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria of the Center for Global Health to refine malaria interventions and develop new tools to stay ahead of the curve and ensure its global investments continue to be successful.",Institutional Research Collaboration between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Centers for Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,9034805,U01GH001646,[' '],CGH,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2015,265000,-0.011052813980574262
"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,8857265,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2015,176472,-0.010935339592609184
"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.

"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8898070,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2015,164698,-0.0024934818608575407
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence.

"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,8925122,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Indium', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RU-486', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,362979,-0.019041114909115944
"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology. Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8874981,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2015,377291,-0.007753704790387149
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.            ",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,8963132,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2015,593802,-0.023927017851148636
"A photographic method for human body composition assessment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of body composition, particularly fat and fat free mass, is vital to understanding many health-related conditions including obesity and sarcopenia, whose very definitions depend on assessment of fat and fat free mass, but also cachexia induced by HIV, cancer, and other diseases; multiple sclerosis; wasting in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy; eating disorders; proper growth in children; and yet others still. Nevertheless, challenges remain in measuring body composition. Existing methods beyond height, weight, and very simple anthropometry are still not the norm in large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical studies. This is because of concerns, depending on method, about cost, portability, time, radiation exposure, and accuracy. Calculation of body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) is a commonly used alternative, but is limited in that it is an assessment of body weight relative to height and not of body fatness per se. A hand-held device that could be carried by any individual, accurately assess fat mass and skeletal muscle mass, and be utilized without any discomfort to the subject, inexpensively, and without radiation exposure would be highly desirable. Evidence suggests that highly experienced trained observers can accurately estimate percentage of body fat by visual examination of subjects, but concerns about accuracy and subjectivity predominate. We hypothesize that we can develop a computer algorithm which can perform as or more accurately when analyzing photographic imagery data, will require no repeated retraining, and eliminate subjectivity. Our first specific aim is to develop a computer image analysis algorithm to accurately estimate adiposity and skeletal muscle mass from standardized photographic images in a bi-ethnic sample of men, women, and children. Our second specific aim is to validate the algorithm in a large diverse sample of men, women, and children. Obesity, loss of skeletal muscle with aging, and other body composition alterations are of profound public health importance. We propose a novel method for measuring the quantity of fat and skeletal muscle mass in humans quickly, painlessly, safely, accurately, and inexpensively that can subsequently be used in many large scale and remote studies.",A photographic method for human body composition assessment,8835138,R01HL107916,"['Abbreviations', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anthropometry', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body Weight', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Cachexia', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Eating Disorders', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equipment', 'Exercise', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Height', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Obesity', 'Painless', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Plethysmography', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Radiation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Skin', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cost', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'field study', 'frailty', 'improved', 'interest', 'lean body mass', 'light weight', 'men', 'muscle form', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'portability', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'sex', 'waist circumference', 'wasting']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2015,515384,-0.020928558456347442
"Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem: it affects >6 million people in the U.S., it is the #1 cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults, and 5-year survival after HF hospitalization is a dismal 35%, regardless of underlying ejection fraction (EF). These statistics highlight the urgent need for prevention of HF and better understanding of how and why HF develops in high-risk individuals. However, a critical limitation of prior population-based studies is the ascertainment of incident HF based on hospitalizations for HF and/or signs of overt volume overload. Many older individuals may suffer from early HF: breathlessness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance (without overt volume overload) due to underlying cardiac structure/function abnormalities, typically with a preserved EF (i.e. early HFpEF). Thus, the current epidemiology of HF is most likely missing a major form of prevalent HF. In this ancillary study of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, Year-15 Exam, n=3500), we will define early HF in a contemporary, multi-ethnic, elderly cohort; we will utilize cutting- edge indices of cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial interactions, including Lagrangian strain and time- varying pressure-stress analyses; and we will perform novel phenomics analyses to better characterize the interplay of risk factors and cardiac structure/function abnormalities (i.e., multi-dimensional phenotypic signatures) as they relate to early and overt HF. The aims of our study are to: (1) determine the prevalence of early HF using a combination of validated symptom surveys, 6-minute walk test, NTproBNP, and echocardiography, with validation using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX); (2) better understand the pathophysiology of early HF, particularly HFpEF; and (3) delineate the key phenotypic signatures associated with early and overt HF. The proposed exam will include anthropometry, blood pressure, symptom surveys, functional status (6-minute walk test), physical activity, laboratory measures (NTproBNP, fasting glucose, renal function), and comprehensive echocardiography (with tissue Doppler and speckle-tracking at rest and during physiologic maneuvers) in all participants. In sub-samples we will also measure arterial tonometry, novel biomarkers, and fitness (CPEX). We will utilize the wealth of data collected during the 5 prior MESA exams to perform longitudinal analyses (including latent class trajectory and statistical learning analyses) to determine the extent to which risk factors are associated with early HF, particularly early HFpEF. By the end of our 4-year study, we will accomplish the following key goals, each of which will have a lasting impact on the field of HF: (1) we will establish the prevalence of early HF in the community; (2) we will have a standardized method for the screening/diagnosis of early HFpEF, validated by CPEX, and readily applicable to the clinical setting; (3) we will define novel mechanisms by which risk factors, alone and in combination, relate to abnormalities in cardiac mechanics and ventricular-arterial coupling in the general population; and (4) we will have defined phenotypic signatures of HF development that will inform future clinical trials for HF prevention and treatment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a common, expensive, and deadly health problem, especially among the elderly. Unfortunately, once overt heart failure develops it is difficult to treat and results in poor outcomes. Therefore it is critical to determine the relationhip between risk factors and abnormalities in heart structure and function that lead to early forms of heart failure. This project aims to: (1) determine how common early heart failure is in the population; (2) better understand the mechanisms of early heart failure by studying the heart and blood vessels using imaging and laboratory tests; and (3) use ""big data"" techniques to harness the wealth of quantitative data we have collected to determine individuals at highest risk for the development of early heart failure.                ","Transition from Risk Factors to Early HF: Prevalence, Pathogenesis, and Phenomics",8864355,R01HL127028,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anthropometry', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dyspnea', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Exercise stress test', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Galectin 3', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Spirometry', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'aged', 'arterial stiffness', 'arterial tonometry', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'fasting glucose', 'fitness', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'novel', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'statistics', 'trend']",NHLBI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,1974550,-0.01996860823493075
"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments.

Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,9067635,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,43567,-0.02439579287899957
"Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Background and goals: Each year in the US, up to 490,000 pregnant women undergo elective induction, an intervention to bring on labor without a medical reason. Whether this causes risks to the woman or fetus is unclear. Only one recent clinical trial studied elective induction before 41 weeks of fetal gestation, and it found no difference in outcomes compared to letting the pregnancy continue (expectant management). Observational studies have found more cesarean delivery after induction, but most compared induction to spontaneous labor at the same gestational age, which is not the genuine clinical alternative. Instead, elective induction should be compared to the true alternative, expectant management. Most studies were too small to study uncommon but important outcomes, and none looked at whether risks differ by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. Our goal is to compare outcomes for elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management, to help pregnant women and their providers make more informed decisions. Methods: A multiphase retrospective study of births from 2001 to 2011 will be conducted in two integrated health care systems. In Phase 1, the eligible population (206,000 singleton births) will be identified and classified by their apparent induction and outcome status based on electronic health plan and birth certificate data. In Phase 2, we will conduct 8000 brief medical record reviews to determine true exposure status (elective induction vs. expectant management). In Phase 3, we will review 3500 records in depth for true outcome status and risk factors. Phases 2 and 3 will oversample women with elective induction or rare outcomes, improving our power to address these specific aims: Aim 1: Compare the risk of the following outcomes after elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management: cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, neonatal intensive care unit stay, shoulder dystocia, low Apgar score, stillbirth, and neonatal death; and Aim 2: Examine how risks vary by the mother's race/ethnicity, parity, and pre-pregnancy obesity. Secondary analyses will develop an algorithm to more accurately identify elective inductions from electronic data. Impact: This research will compare elective labor induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation to expectant management to provide new information about its risks or benefits for the mother and fetus. Our results could immediately affect clinical practice by helping women and providers make more informed choices together. They will also provide a solid foundation for practice guidelines and policy making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many pregnant women undergo elective induction (bringing on labor without a medical reason), but there is little good information about whether this is risk for the mother or fetus. Few studies have compared elective induction to the true alternative, letting the pregnancy continue, with birth at a later date; and it is not known whether risks diffe by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. The study would fill these critical knowledge gaps, and findings could immediately shape clinical practice.",Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes,8887237,R01HD071986,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Dystocia', 'Electronics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Fetus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Services Research', 'Infant Health', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Physician&apos', 's Practice Patterns', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Solid', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'Wing', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'electronic data', 'fetal', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'intraamniotic infection', 'neonatal death', 'parity', 'pregnant', 'stillbirth', 'tool', 'trend']",NICHD,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,769163,-0.010377296337809105
"EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is associated with numerous health outcomes including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Over 30% of adults and 17% of children in the US are obese, with lack of physical activity (PA) and constraints in the built environment (BE) common culprits. As such, the US Guide to Community Preventive Services currently recommends the following BE interventions to increase PA and reduce obesity: (1) community and street-scale urban design and land use policies; (2) creation of, or enhanced access to places for physical activity; and (3) transportation policies and practices. The proposed project will use an archive of 23,000 publically-available, online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to develop reliable and valid tools to improve the capture of global PA patterns and BE characteristics. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and test the reliability of using publically-available, outdoor webcams to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns across thousands of global outdoor environments; and 2) Develop and test the reliability and validity of using crowdsourcing to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns. (13) The aims will be accomplished by using the Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes (AMOS) that has collected over 325 million images of outdoor environments from more than 23,000 webcam since 2006. Every identified, outdoor, publically-available online webcam is added to the AMOS dataset with an image taken and archived every 30 minutes from the webcam thereafter. Scenes include street intersections, plazas, and parks. We will use crowdsourcing to annotate each webcam scene. The crowdsourcing platform is Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), an Internet marketplace allowing people to be paid to complete small, computer-based tasks. The individual tasks are posted to the AMT website. We will use AMT tasks to annotate each AMOS webcam scene by identifying BE characteristics (established from the Active Neighborhood Checklist and Public Open Space Tool) and patterns of PA (established from SOPARC). This study is significant in its ability to increase by orders of magnitude the amount and quality of global recorded measurements of PA patterns and associated BE characteristics. This project is innovative by: 1) combining two distinct disciplines to use public, outdoor webcams to evaluate PA patterns and BE characteristics; 2) utilizing crowdsourcing to provide simple PA counts and indication of BE characteristics; and 3) its ability to greatly improve the generalizability of public health surveillance. Our results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA and the BE.

"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.            ",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,8953935,R03OH010956,[' '],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2015,66904,-0.00799643647554177
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,8935645,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2015,652270,-0.00017196814298463248

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.

"Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in five adults in the U.S. are thought to be living with a disability, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting physical movement patterns. Medical care costs related to disability in the US exceed $300 billion annually. Regular physical activity (PA) represents an important modifiable behavior to improve the overall health of these disabled groups and to realize their movement potential. Substantial progress has been made in developing and testing wearable monitor calibrations to predict physical activity (PA) level and type. However, little scientific attention has been given to develop methods to assess PA in disabled populations. The aims of this application focus on filling this scientific knowledge gap. Specific Aim 1) To measure impairment and function to provide a movement disorder analysis of: a) no movement limitation; b) upper extremity limitation; c) lower extremity limitation, or d) both upper and lower extremity limitation. Specific Aim 2) To measure bilateral wrist, hip, and ankle acceleration to conditionally model metabolic cost and activity type estimates. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by first carrying out a multitude of advanced upper and lower body strength, coordination, and functional motor tasks to isolate key impairment and function limitations across a diverse population with movement pattern differences. Then using an unsupervised learning and cluster analysis approach we will use these data to evaluate a fast, convenient, and simple metric to categorize functional movement pattern differences. We will assess criterion energy cost and multiple hip and limb acceleration during an extensive battery of activities of daily living, to guide the development of single or combined wearable motion sensor algorithms across categories of functional movement groups using advanced analytical techniques. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to both categorize and assess PA in persons with movement limitations. This will present the foundation to evaluate a decision-tree approach to guide both monitor placement and algorithm choice to assess PA in diverse populations. Ultimately, our work will provide the potential to precisely and accurately assess PA prevalence rates, effectiveness of behavior-based PA interventions, and PA dose-response relationships to prevent and manage disabling conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) in populations with disability is essential to determine the effectiveness of behaviorally based PA interventions, and further our understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health in these groups. The overall aim of this proposal is to extensively validate wearable monitor calibrations across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.                ",Physical Activity Calibration in Individuals with Movement Limitations,8749880,R21HD080828,"['Acceleration', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'age related', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'disabling disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'named group', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sensor']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2014,204427,-0.006329571655949385
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8723038,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,156324,-0.016794500334877237
"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.            ",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,8815240,R01NS086885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'Amnesia', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iraq', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Moods', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reliance', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'executive function', 'gray matter', 'inattention', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,344166,-0.017444267696380942
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.            ",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,8721037,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'human Huntingtin protein', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2014,359539,-0.013301844322506143
"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.          The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.

"Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable progress in understanding the biology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable biomarkers are still lacking, however, for early stage detection of PD and for characterizing disease progression. Advances in biotechnology have led to the advent of mental health studies that collect large-scale, multi-dimensional data sets, including brain imaging data, genomic data, and biologic and clinical measures. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that stand to gain a deeper understanding of PD. A major limiting factor to multidimensional biomarker development, however, is the lack of statistical tools available to accommodate diverse, large-scale data. Leveraging data from neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) of the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra, chemical shift imaging (CSI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, genotype information, and numerous clinical variables, we plan to develop novel statistical techniques to identify multimodal PD biomarkers. Our data provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting methodological advances in multimodal PD biomarker discovery. Separately, we will consider a massive patient database with nearly 250,000 subscribers in Georgia. Building on our collective expertise in developing statistical and machine-learning methods for large-scale imaging data and in the pathophysiology of PD, we plan to advance methods for PD biomarker analyses and discovery through the following specific aims. First, we plan to develop new statistical techniques to reveal multimodal biomarkers for PD including imaging, clinical, and biologic variables. Secondly, we plan to utilize the massive clinical database to identify clinical risk factors for early stage PD. Thirdly, we will develop software equipped with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the multimodal biomarker detection methods.          There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments. Large studies with clinical, molecular, genetic, and neuroimaging measures produce complex multidimensional datasets, which may be useful to help establish such biomarkers. We plan to develop new statistical methods that integrate multiple high-dimensional data sets to identify accurate and robust multimodal biomarkers of PD.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.

"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home. This project will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to biological outcomes such as insulin resistance.",(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk,8722512,R01CA179977,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Calories', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Code', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Income', 'Inflammation', 'Information Systems', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recreation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Self Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'demographics', 'density', 'fast food', 'food environment', 'good diet', 'inflammatory marker', 'land use', 'learned behavior', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'residence', 'sedentary', 'sugar', 'tv watching']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,715557,-0.013021210952540793
"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.            ","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",8767056,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2014,167317,-0.0021411032893043414
"Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifestyle interventions, while effective at reducing weight and diabetes risk, are intensive (i.e., requiring 16 or more face-to-face visits) which has prevented widespread implementation. Mobile technology may reduce intervention intensity while preserving outcomes by assisting in the delivery of behavioral strategies, but very little research has explored this. Weight loss mobile applications are proliferating in the open market; however our work and others2 show that the range of evidence-based strategies addressed by these apps is narrow, primarily including self-monitoring, prompts, goal-setting, and sometimes a social network.3 A key strategy missing across apps in both the market and research is problem solving, an essential component of behavioral weight loss interventions.4 We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize tha Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone, with biggest differences observable after face-to- face visits end. Using a ""crowd-sourcing"" model, we will populate a database with problems and solutions via 1) expert-delivered problem solving sessions with a sample of obese participants trying to lose weight and 2) a pre-pilot test of the app. Using principles of ""artificial intelligence"" we will convert the algorithm of problem solving counseling into the mobile application so that it may perform this strategy on its own, but based on expert and crowd-sourced information. We will then use a series of iterative steps involving qualitative research methods (usability testing, focus groups, and pre-piloting) to refine the tool A randomized pilot feasibility trial will test the feasibility and initial effects of the Smart Coah mobile application when paired with a shortened (8- week) behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a shortened behavioral weight intervention alone. Feasibility outcomes include frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention. We will also do exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8- and 16-weeks. Data will support a larger efficacy trial of a Smart Coach-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone. Our overarching goal is to develop mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden the reach to people and settings that currently have little access.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mobile technology that effectively delivers behavioral strategies to reduce the intensity of weight loss intervention while also preserving outcomes is needed to increase the impact and reach of behavioral weight loss interventions. A key strategy missing across mobile applications developed in both the market and research is problem solving, an active ingredient and central feature of behavioral weight loss interventions. We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize that Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions as the standard program) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone.

"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,8711562,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2014,176472,-0.010935339592609184
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.            ",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8738041,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Simulate', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2014,180608,-0.0024934818608575407
"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.

"Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography  Project Summary/Abstract  Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease by imaging the left ventricle (LV) of the heart at rest and then after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia. However, acquisitions are heavily operator dependent, two-dimensional (2D), and interpretation is generally based on qualitative assessment. While a variety of quan- titative 2D approaches have been proposed in the research literature, none have been shown to be superior to the still highly variable qualitative visual comparison of rest/stress echocardiographic image sequences for detecting ischemic disease. Here, we propose that the way forward must focus on a new computational im- age analysis paradigm for quantitative 4D (three spatial dimensions plus time) stress echocardiography. Our strategy integrates information derived from both radiofrequency (RF) and B-mode echocardiographic images acquired using a matrix array probe. The integrated analysis system will yield accurate and robust measures of strain and strain rate - at rest, stress and differentiallly between rest and stress - that will identify my- ocardial tissue at-risk after dobutamine-induced stress. This work will involve the development of novel (1) phase-sensitive, correlation-based RF ultrasound speckle tracking to estimate mid-wall displacements, (2) ma- chine learning techniques to localize the LV bounding surfaces and their displacements from B-mode data, (3) a meshless integration approach based on radial basis functions (RBFs) and Bayesian reasoning/sparse coding to estimate dense spatiotemporal parameters of strain and strain rate and (4) non-rigid registration of rest and stress image sequences to develop unique, 3D differential deformation parameters. The quantitative approach will be validated with implanted sonomicrometers and microsphere-derived flows using an acute canine model of stenosis. The ability of deformation and differential deformation derived from 4D stress echocardiography to detect new myocardial tissue at-risk in the presence of existing infarction will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic canine model of infarction with superimposed ischemia. The technique will be translated to hu- mans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility of our deformation and differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Three main collaborators will team on this work. A group led by Matthew O'Donnell from the University of Washington will develop the RF-based speckle tracking methods. An image analysis group led by the PI James Duncan at Yale University will develop methods for segmentation, shape tracking, dense displacement integration and strain computation. A cardiology/physiology group under Dr. Albert Sinusas at Yale will perform the acute and chronic canine studies and the human stress echo studies. A consultant from Philips Medical Systems will work with the entire team to bridge the ultrasound image acquisition technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease are commonly performed using stress echocardiography, a test that is performed 3 million times in the United States annually. Our new methods will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation in 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) due to stress using a cost efficient and noninvasive imaging technology. The resulting methodology may lead to more sensitive and accurate detection of stress-induced ischemia that will better guide clinical decision making.            ",Integrated RF and B-mode Deformation Analysis for 4D Stress Echocardiography,8614454,R01HL121226,"['Acute', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiology', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diastole', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dobutamine', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Frequencies', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Radio', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Surface', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'data integration', 'elastography', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,819740,-0.024381375946160418
"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8691819,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,373821,-0.007753704790387149
"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.            ",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,8766404,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Indium', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RU-486', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,387356,-0.019041114909115944
"A photographic method for human body composition assessment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of body composition, particularly fat and fat free mass, is vital to understanding many health-related conditions including obesity and sarcopenia, whose very definitions depend on assessment of fat and fat free mass, but also cachexia induced by HIV, cancer, and other diseases; multiple sclerosis; wasting in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy; eating disorders; proper growth in children; and yet others still. Nevertheless, challenges remain in measuring body composition. Existing methods beyond height, weight, and very simple anthropometry are still not the norm in large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical studies. This is because of concerns, depending on method, about cost, portability, time, radiation exposure, and accuracy. Calculation of body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) is a commonly used alternative, but is limited in that it is an assessment of body weight relative to height and not of body fatness per se. A hand-held device that could be carried by any individual, accurately assess fat mass and skeletal muscle mass, and be utilized without any discomfort to the subject, inexpensively, and without radiation exposure would be highly desirable. Evidence suggests that highly experienced trained observers can accurately estimate percentage of body fat by visual examination of subjects, but concerns about accuracy and subjectivity predominate. We hypothesize that we can develop a computer algorithm which can perform as or more accurately when analyzing photographic imagery data, will require no repeated retraining, and eliminate subjectivity. Our first specific aim is to develop a computer image analysis algorithm to accurately estimate adiposity and skeletal muscle mass from standardized photographic images in a bi-ethnic sample of men, women, and children. Our second specific aim is to validate the algorithm in a large diverse sample of men, women, and children.          Obesity, loss of skeletal muscle with aging, and other body composition alterations are of profound public health importance. We propose a novel method for measuring the quantity of fat and skeletal muscle mass in humans quickly, painlessly, safely, accurately, and inexpensively that can subsequently be used in many large scale and remote studies.

"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.                ",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,8698820,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,506032,-0.02439579287899957
"Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Background and goals: Each year in the US, up to 490,000 pregnant women undergo elective induction, an intervention to bring on labor without a medical reason. Whether this causes risks to the woman or fetus is unclear. Only one recent clinical trial studied elective induction before 41 weeks of fetal gestation, and it found no difference in outcomes compared to letting the pregnancy continue (expectant management). Observational studies have found more cesarean delivery after induction, but most compared induction to spontaneous labor at the same gestational age, which is not the genuine clinical alternative. Instead, elective induction should be compared to the true alternative, expectant management. Most studies were too small to study uncommon but important outcomes, and none looked at whether risks differ by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. Our goal is to compare outcomes for elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management, to help pregnant women and their providers make more informed decisions. Methods: A multiphase retrospective study of births from 2001 to 2011 will be conducted in two integrated health care systems. In Phase 1, the eligible population (206,000 singleton births) will be identified and classified by their apparent induction and outcome status based on electronic health plan and birth certificate data. In Phase 2, we will conduct 8000 brief medical record reviews to determine true exposure status (elective induction vs. expectant management). In Phase 3, we will review 3500 records in depth for true outcome status and risk factors. Phases 2 and 3 will oversample women with elective induction or rare outcomes, improving our power to address these specific aims: Aim 1: Compare the risk of the following outcomes after elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management: cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, neonatal intensive care unit stay, shoulder dystocia, low Apgar score, stillbirth, and neonatal death; and Aim 2: Examine how risks vary by the mother's race/ethnicity, parity, and pre-pregnancy obesity. Secondary analyses will develop an algorithm to more accurately identify elective inductions from electronic data. Impact: This research will compare elective labor induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation to expectant management to provide new information about its risks or benefits for the mother and fetus. Our results could immediately affect clinical practice by helping women and providers make more informed choices together. They will also provide a solid foundation for practice guidelines and policy making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many pregnant women undergo elective induction (bringing on labor without a medical reason), but there is little good information about whether this is risk for the mother or fetus. Few studies have compared elective induction to the true alternative, letting the pregnancy continue, with birth at a later date; and it is not known whether risks diffe by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. The study would fill these critical knowledge gaps, and findings could immediately shape clinical practice.            ",Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes,8701182,R01HD071986,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Dystocia', 'Electronics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Fetus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Services Research', 'Infant Health', 'Infection of amniotic sac and membranes', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Physician&apos', 's Practice Patterns', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Solid', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'Wing', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'electronic data', 'fetal', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'neonatal death', 'parity', 'pregnant', 'public health relevance', 'stillbirth', 'tool', 'trend']",NICHD,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,786907,-0.010377296337809105
"EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING  PROJECT ABSTRACT Obesity is associated with numerous health outcomes including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Over 30% of adults and 17% of children in the US are obese, with lack of physical activity (PA) and constraints in the built environment (BE) common culprits. As such, the US Guide to Community Preventive Services currently recommends the following BE interventions to increase PA and reduce obesity: (1) community and street-scale urban design and land use policies; (2) creation of, or enhanced access to places for physical activity; and (3) transportation policies and practices. The proposed project will use an archive of 23,000 publically-available, online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to develop reliable and valid tools to improve the capture of global PA patterns and BE characteristics. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and test the reliability of using publically-available, outdoor webcams to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns across thousands of global outdoor environments; and 2) Develop and test the reliability and validity of using crowdsourcing to enumerate BE characteristics and PA patterns. (13) The aims will be accomplished by using the Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes (AMOS) that has collected over 325 million images of outdoor environments from more than 23,000 webcam since 2006. Every identified, outdoor, publically-available online webcam is added to the AMOS dataset with an image taken and archived every 30 minutes from the webcam thereafter. Scenes include street intersections, plazas, and parks. We will use crowdsourcing to annotate each webcam scene. The crowdsourcing platform is Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), an Internet marketplace allowing people to be paid to complete small, computer-based tasks. The individual tasks are posted to the AMT website. We will use AMT tasks to annotate each AMOS webcam scene by identifying BE characteristics (established from the Active Neighborhood Checklist and Public Open Space Tool) and patterns of PA (established from SOPARC). This study is significant in its ability to increase by orders of magnitude the amount and quality of global recorded measurements of PA patterns and associated BE characteristics. This project is innovative by: 1) combining two distinct disciplines to use public, outdoor webcams to evaluate PA patterns and BE characteristics; 2) utilizing crowdsourcing to provide simple PA counts and indication of BE characteristics; and 3) its ability to greatly improve the generalizability of public health surveillance. Our results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA and the BE. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to combine computer science and public health to use online, outdoor webcams and crowdsourcing to enumerate global physical activity patterns and built environment characteristics. Webcams and crowdsourcing will be evaluated for reliability and validity. Results will yield actionable knowledge regarding the use of webcams and crowdsourcing to assess PA patterns and BE characteristics.            ",EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: ASSESSING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH WEBCAMS AND CROWDSOURCING,8620889,R21CA186481,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Archives', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Feeds', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Social Sciences', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'web site']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,198360,0.003218989640911122
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,8815713,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2014,709980,-0.00017196814298463248

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.                ",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8640521,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2013,271188,-0.010325026609182138
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8593988,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,156324,-0.016794500334877237
"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.          The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does.

"Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable progress in understanding the biology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable biomarkers are still lacking, however, for early stage detection of PD and for characterizing disease progression. Advances in biotechnology have led to the advent of mental health studies that collect large-scale, multi-dimensional data sets, including brain imaging data, genomic data, and biologic and clinical measures. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that stand to gain a deeper understanding of PD. A major limiting factor to multidimensional biomarker development, however, is the lack of statistical tools available to accommodate diverse, large-scale data. Leveraging data from neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) of the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra, chemical shift imaging (CSI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, genotype information, and numerous clinical variables, we plan to develop novel statistical techniques to identify multimodal PD biomarkers. Our data provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting methodological advances in multimodal PD biomarker discovery. Separately, we will consider a massive patient database with nearly 250,000 subscribers in Georgia. Building on our collective expertise in developing statistical and machine-learning methods for large-scale imaging data and in the pathophysiology of PD, we plan to advance methods for PD biomarker analyses and discovery through the following specific aims. First, we plan to develop new statistical techniques to reveal multimodal biomarkers for PD including imaging, clinical, and biologic variables. Secondly, we plan to utilize the massive clinical database to identify clinical risk factors for early stage PD. Thirdly, we will develop software equipped with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the multimodal biomarker detection methods.          There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments. Large studies with clinical, molecular, genetic, and neuroimaging measures produce complex multidimensional datasets, which may be useful to help establish such biomarkers. We plan to develop new statistical methods that integrate multiple high-dimensional data sets to identify accurate and robust multimodal biomarkers of PD.

"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home. This project will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to biological outcomes such as insulin resistance.                ",(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk,8590146,R01CA179977,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Calories', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Code', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Income', 'Inflammation', 'Information Systems', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recreation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Self Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'demographics', 'density', 'fast food', 'food environment', 'good diet', 'inflammatory marker', 'land use', 'learned behavior', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'residence', 'sedentary', 'sugar', 'tv watching']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,733604,-0.013021210952540793
"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.

"Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifestyle interventions, while effective at reducing weight and diabetes risk, are intensive (i.e., requiring 16 or more face-to-face visits) which has prevented widespread implementation. Mobile technology may reduce intervention intensity while preserving outcomes by assisting in the delivery of behavioral strategies, but very little research has explored this. Weight loss mobile applications are proliferating in the open market; however our work and others2 show that the range of evidence-based strategies addressed by these apps is narrow, primarily including self-monitoring, prompts, goal-setting, and sometimes a social network.3 A key strategy missing across apps in both the market and research is problem solving, an essential component of behavioral weight loss interventions.4 We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize tha Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone, with biggest differences observable after face-to- face visits end. Using a ""crowd-sourcing"" model, we will populate a database with problems and solutions via 1) expert-delivered problem solving sessions with a sample of obese participants trying to lose weight and 2) a pre-pilot test of the app. Using principles of ""artificial intelligence"" we will convert the algorithm of problem solving counseling into the mobile application so that it may perform this strategy on its own, but based on expert and crowd-sourced information. We will then use a series of iterative steps involving qualitative research methods (usability testing, focus groups, and pre-piloting) to refine the tool A randomized pilot feasibility trial will test the feasibility and initial effects of the Smart Coah mobile application when paired with a shortened (8- week) behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a shortened behavioral weight intervention alone. Feasibility outcomes include frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention. We will also do exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8- and 16-weeks. Data will support a larger efficacy trial of a Smart Coach-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone. Our overarching goal is to develop mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden the reach to people and settings that currently have little access.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mobile technology that effectively delivers behavioral strategies to reduce the intensity of weight loss intervention while also preserving outcomes is needed to increase the impact and reach of behavioral weight loss interventions. A key strategy missing across mobile applications developed in both the market and research is problem solving, an active ingredient and central feature of behavioral weight loss interventions. We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems.

"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.                ",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,8581368,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2013,176472,-0.010935339592609184
"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposal will explore obesity treatment strategies using small molecule allosteric modulators as probes of Y receptors.            ",Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors,8578312,R01DK097376,"['Adverse effects', 'Affinity', 'Agonist', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Arrestins', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain Stem', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chemosensitization', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consultations', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Histamine Receptor', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Obesity', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Polypeptide', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Play', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Retinal Cone', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'chemical synthesis', 'cheminformatics', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'high throughput screening', 'interest', 'member', 'neuropeptide Y', 'neuropeptide Y4 receptor', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'peptide hormone', 'polypeptide', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic development', 'tissue-factor-pathway inhibitor 2', 'treatment strategy', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,352032,-0.03322136735977769
"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations.

"A photographic method for human body composition assessment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of body composition, particularly fat and fat free mass, is vital to understanding many health-related conditions including obesity and sarcopenia, whose very definitions depend on assessment of fat and fat free mass, but also cachexia induced by HIV, cancer, and other diseases; multiple sclerosis; wasting in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy; eating disorders; proper growth in children; and yet others still. Nevertheless, challenges remain in measuring body composition. Existing methods beyond height, weight, and very simple anthropometry are still not the norm in large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical studies. This is because of concerns, depending on method, about cost, portability, time, radiation exposure, and accuracy. Calculation of body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) is a commonly used alternative, but is limited in that it is an assessment of body weight relative to height and not of body fatness per se. A hand-held device that could be carried by any individual, accurately assess fat mass and skeletal muscle mass, and be utilized without any discomfort to the subject, inexpensively, and without radiation exposure would be highly desirable. Evidence suggests that highly experienced trained observers can accurately estimate percentage of body fat by visual examination of subjects, but concerns about accuracy and subjectivity predominate. We hypothesize that we can develop a computer algorithm which can perform as or more accurately when analyzing photographic imagery data, will require no repeated retraining, and eliminate subjectivity. Our first specific aim is to develop a computer image analysis algorithm to accurately estimate adiposity and skeletal muscle mass from standardized photographic images in a bi-ethnic sample of men, women, and children. Our second specific aim is to validate the algorithm in a large diverse sample of men, women, and children.          Obesity, loss of skeletal muscle with aging, and other body composition alterations are of profound public health importance. We propose a novel method for measuring the quantity of fat and skeletal muscle mass in humans quickly, painlessly, safely, accurately, and inexpensively that can subsequently be used in many large scale and remote studies.

"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.                ",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,8495026,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,506938,-0.02439579287899957
"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research.       To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification; and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success.       Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs). However, growing resistance to the class of insecticide used on the nets threatens to make this protection ineffective. We propose to develop a new class of insecticide that is safe for ITN deployment, effective against current insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and less likely to promote emergence of new resistant strains.

"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects. Other specific aims of the project include the application of the proposed methods to two national data sets collected, respectively, from the Louisiana Child Health Study and the Heartbeat! Project, and the dissemination of a user-friendly software program for increasing the potential impact of the project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a social epidemic, childhood obesity is the result of the interaction between many levels of personal behavior and risk factors, as well as obesogenic ecological factors that span many sources, including families, schools, and communities. Using a broad and interdisciplinary team of clinical and methodology scientists, this project develops advanced analytic tools that could help clinicians better understand the mechanisms of how multiple levels of risk factors lead to childhood obesity, including the relative importance of the risk factors.

"Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable progress in understanding the biology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable biomarkers are still lacking, however, for early stage detection of PD and for characterizing disease progression. Advances in biotechnology have led to the advent of mental health studies that collect large-scale, multi-dimensional data sets, including brain imaging data, genomic data, and biologic and clinical measures. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that stand to gain a deeper understanding of PD. A major limiting factor to multidimensional biomarker development, however, is the lack of statistical tools available to accommodate diverse, large-scale data. Leveraging data from neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) of the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra, chemical shift imaging (CSI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, genotype information, and numerous clinical variables, we plan to develop novel statistical techniques to identify multimodal PD biomarkers. Our data provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting methodological advances in multimodal PD biomarker discovery. Separately, we will consider a massive patient database with nearly 250,000 subscribers in Georgia. Building on our collective expertise in developing statistical and machine-learning methods for large-scale imaging data and in the pathophysiology of PD, we plan to advance methods for PD biomarker analyses and discovery through the following specific aims. First, we plan to develop new statistical techniques to reveal multimodal biomarkers for PD including imaging, clinical, and biologic variables. Secondly, we plan to utilize the massive clinical database to identify clinical risk factors for early stage PD. Thirdly, we will develop software equipped with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the multimodal biomarker detection methods.         There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments. Large studies with clinical, molecular, genetic, and neuroimaging measures produce complex multidimensional datasets, which may be useful to help establish such biomarkers. We plan to develop new statistical methods that integrate multiple high-dimensional data sets to identify accurate and robust multimodal biomarkers of PD.",Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease,8889317,U18NS082143,[' '],NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U18,2013,215807,-0.017299533229298353
"Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Background and goals: Each year in the US, up to 490,000 pregnant women undergo elective induction, an intervention to bring on labor without a medical reason. Whether this causes risks to the woman or fetus is unclear. Only one recent clinical trial studied elective induction before 41 weeks of fetal gestation, and it found no difference in outcomes compared to letting the pregnancy continue (expectant management). Observational studies have found more cesarean delivery after induction, but most compared induction to spontaneous labor at the same gestational age, which is not the genuine clinical alternative. Instead, elective induction should be compared to the true alternative, expectant management. Most studies were too small to study uncommon but important outcomes, and none looked at whether risks differ by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. Our goal is to compare outcomes for elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management, to help pregnant women and their providers make more informed decisions. Methods: A multiphase retrospective study of births from 2001 to 2011 will be conducted in two integrated health care systems. In Phase 1, the eligible population (206,000 singleton births) will be identified and classified by their apparent induction and outcome status based on electronic health plan and birth certificate data. In Phase 2, we will conduct 8000 brief medical record reviews to determine true exposure status (elective induction vs. expectant management). In Phase 3, we will review 3500 records in depth for true outcome status and risk factors. Phases 2 and 3 will oversample women with elective induction or rare outcomes, improving our power to address these specific aims: Aim 1: Compare the risk of the following outcomes after elective induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation versus expectant management: cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, neonatal intensive care unit stay, shoulder dystocia, low Apgar score, stillbirth, and neonatal death; and Aim 2: Examine how risks vary by the mother's race/ethnicity, parity, and pre-pregnancy obesity. Secondary analyses will develop an algorithm to more accurately identify elective inductions from electronic data. Impact: This research will compare elective labor induction at 38, 39 or 40 weeks' gestation to expectant management to provide new information about its risks or benefits for the mother and fetus. Our results could immediately affect clinical practice by helping women and providers make more informed choices together. They will also provide a solid foundation for practice guidelines and policy making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many pregnant women undergo elective induction (bringing on labor without a medical reason), but there is little good information about whether this is risk for the mother or fetus. Few studies have compared elective induction to the true alternative, letting the pregnancy continue, with birth at a later date; and it is not known whether risks diffe by the mother's race/ethnicity or obesity. The study would fill these critical knowledge gaps, and findings could immediately shape clinical practice.            ",Elective Induction of Labor and Pregnancy Outcomes,8437066,R01HD071986,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apgar Score', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Dystocia', 'Electronics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Fetus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Services Research', 'Infant Health', 'Infection of amniotic sac and membranes', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Physician&apos', 's Practice Patterns', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Shapes', 'Shoulder', 'Solid', 'System', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'Wing', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'electronic data', 'fetal', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'neonatal death', 'parity', 'pregnant', 'public health relevance', 'stillbirth', 'tool', 'trend']",NICHD,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,774381,-0.010377296337809105
"A New Approach to Compute PM2.5 for Health Impact Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental air quality impacts human well-being and disease, but the availability of air quality data is limited to selected locations because of the complexity involved in its measurement. Among air pollutants, PM2.5 is of the greatest concern. These particles are not captured by the lungs' natural defenses and can be inhaled deeply, where they can cause health problems ranging from asthma attacks to heart disease.  PM2.5 currently is measured primarily by ground monitoring stations located at approximately 320 EPA sites, providing limited local geographic coverage. However, there are satellites that make a variety of aerosol observations and provide a daily global picture of atmospheric particulates in the form of aerosol optical depth (AOD). Scientists have attempted to compute ground-level PM2.5 (GLP) from these AOD data. However, the multivariate nonlinear relationship between AOD and PM2.5 imposes limitations in computing GLP using satellite data. This project proposes to overcome these limitations by computing reliable GLP via a new methodology which has already been tested and validated.  The study has two specific aims: (1) develop satellite-derived daily GLP estimates for the contiguous U.S., and (2) examine spatial and temporal associations between GLP exposure and hospital visits for asthma exacerbation in Mississippi. Using our methodology, we will generate daily GLP data for a 12-month period at a resolution of 0.10x0.10 (~10x10km2), providing approximately 82,000 data points as opposed to about 300 data points available daily from EPA ground monitoring stations within the contiguous U.S. We will address the nonlinear relationship between PM2.5 and AOD which is a function of humidity, temperature, surface pressure, surface wind speed, surface type, boundary layer height, and AOD by accounting for these variables using a machine learning process. The AOD that will be used in this process will be generated by merging AOD data from multiple satellite sensors. Meteorological data will come from NOAA NCEP. Surface type data will be obtained from the satellite-identified vegetation index. Boundary layer height, which is the mixed layer of the atmosphere closest to the ground where people live and work, will come from CALIPSO data which provides vertical profiles of atmospheric aerosol extinction.  Information on GLP levels will allow the scientific community to better understand health impacts from exposure to low, moderate, or high levels of PM2.5. Moreover, in places where PM2.5 levels are elevated only occasionally, such as Mississippi, the short-term health impact of increases in PM2.5 can be studied more precisely. National GLP data will be made available to other researchers to facilitate future explorations of how PM2.5 exposure impacts a wide range of health conditions, thereby making possible more timely prophylactic treatment, improving healthcare system preparedness, and better informing public health policymaking.          Among air pollutants, particulates 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller (PM2.5) have the greatest impact on human health because they are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, making allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions worse.

"Can neuroscience dramatically improve our ability to design health communications     DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)    Abstract: Can neuroscience dramatically improve our ability to design health communications? Modifiable health behaviors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and alcohol consumption are leading causes of morbidity and mortaiity, both in the United Statesl and throughout the developed world2; yet changing these behaviors has proved an immensely challenging problem. Classic behavior change theories provide a foundation to develop and understand effective health campaigns and interventions;3 however there is still considerable variability in the effectiveness of such campaigns that we are unable to predict and explain. By improving our ability to understand and predict behavior change, neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl) may aid in the creation of maximally effective health campaigns. There may be important precursors of behavior change that are not easily obtained through self-reports, but that can be assessed with fMRl. In particular, people are notoriously limited in their ability to predict their own future  o. behavior and accurately identiy their internal mental processes through verbal and written self-report Our team has found that activity in a prioridefined neural regions of interest can double the proportion of variance explained in individual behavior change following persuasive messaging, beyond self-report measures (e.9. attitudes, intentions, self-efficacy).5'6 The current proposal posits a next leap: neuroimaging technology may also be applied to more accurately forecast population level responses to health communications, and could dramatically improve the way that we design and select health communications. To this end, we propose to: (1) identify the neurocognitive signatures of health communications that are successful at changing behavior at the population level; (2) use these maps to forecast the success of new health messages; and, (3) use the information gained about underlying mechanisms of message success to advance theory and to develop novel strategies for message design. We will employ sophisticated multivariate and machine learning data analysis techniques (e.9. reinforcement learning models and pattern classification) to characterize the neural systems that are involved in processing successful health messages (i.e. messages that ultimately facilitate behavior change in larger, independent groups). Such techniques will provide insight about the mechanisms that lead messages to be optimally effective for populations on average, as well as helping to understand heterogeneity within populations (i.e. for whom are given messages likely to be most effective). These techniques will also allow us to define models that optimally combine neuroimaging data with other available data sources (e.9. self-report). Achievement of our goals (to identify neural patterns that predict message success and to test the psychological meaning of these activations) will facilitate the design and dissemination of more effective health messages, and will allow more efficient translation of core theoretical advances across behavior and disease specific silos.    Public Health Relevance: Modifiable health behaviors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and alcohol consumption are leading causes of morbidity and mortality, both in the United States1 and throughout the developed world2; yet changing these behaviors has proved an immensely challenging problem.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"Validating Machine-Learned Classifiers of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activit     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary behavior (SB) is a health risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Epidemiologic data reveal consistent associations between SB and numerous cancers, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple markers of metabolic dysfunction. Reducing SB is recommended as a viable new cancer prevention strategy. Hip mounted accelerometry is a field-based criterion measure of PA but is inadequate for measuring SB. Misclassification most often occurs when movements are performed with limited trunk displacement, under load or on an incline, on a vibrating surface (e.g., in a car), or when they are too small to be distinguished from non-wear time. This is unacceptable because we may then mischaracterize the prevalence of both SB and PA. Measurement error obscures true relationships between behavior and health, and the effects of interventions may go undetected. [Our study will improve upon laboratory studies that do little to test SB in natural environments such as driving or watching TV. Lab-based machine learning algorithms for SB are aided by the artificial start and end points. Algorithms based upon research in free living settings will be more generalizable and applicable to intervention research]. In this study we will refine and validate new machine-learned classification algorithms for a continuum of behaviors from SB to MVPA using accelerometer, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This study will focus on behaviors that are most frequently misclassified: moderate intensity activities that are coded as light, light activities that are coded as sedentary, and sedentary activities that are coded as light or non wear time. [We will improve upon current self-report and accelerometer estimates by 30-50%.] We will focus on four primary behavioral classes: lying, sitting, standing, and ambulatory locomotion. A total of 210 participants (ages 6-10 yrs, n = 70; 16-55 yrs, n=70; 65-85 yrs, n= 70) will be recruited over a 2-yr period and will wear 3 ActiGraph accelerometers (two hip, one wrist); a GPS device, and a SenseCam (an automatic image capture device) for two weekdays and 1 weekend day. [A subsample will repeat the procedures for a further 3 days]. For a 6 hr period on each of these days, participants will also be directly observed by trained coders who will record free living behaviors using a novel portable behavioral assessment system developed for the iPad. Direct observation data will provide 'ground-truths' of behavior for an annotated data file recorded at one-second intervals. For free-living behaviors not directly observed, SenseCam images will be used. Machine learning Kernel methods will be employed. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and other ROC graph methods will be used to compare classifiers derived from: (a) single axis vs. multi axis accelerometer data; (b) movement 'counts' vs. raw acceleration data; and (c) hip vs. wrist mounted accelerometers. Analyses will determine the improvement in sensitivity and specificity when GPS and GIS data are added. We will evaluate the need for population specific classifiers and quantify measurement error in cut-points that are currently employed.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does. However, we do not measure sitting time very accurately and when we ask people to tell us how much they do, their answers are unreliable. Our study will use small sensors to objectively measure when people sit or do physical activity, and we will use sophisticated computational techniques to summarize these movement patterns.                  The majority of the US population spends most of the day sitting and we have new scientific evidence that this can contribute to poor health regardless of how much physical activity a person does.

"Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable progress in understanding the biology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable biomarkers are still lacking, however, for early stage detection of PD and for characterizing disease progression. Advances in biotechnology have led to the advent of mental health studies that collect large-scale, multi-dimensional data sets, including brain imaging data, genomic data, and biologic and clinical measures. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that stand to gain a deeper understanding of PD. A major limiting factor to multidimensional biomarker development, however, is the lack of statistical tools available to accommodate diverse, large-scale data. Leveraging data from neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) of the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra, chemical shift imaging (CSI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, genotype information, and numerous clinical variables, we plan to develop novel statistical techniques to identify multimodal PD biomarkers. Our data provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting methodological advances in multimodal PD biomarker discovery. Separately, we will consider a massive patient database with nearly 250,000 subscribers in Georgia. Building on our collective expertise in developing statistical and machine-learning methods for large-scale imaging data and in the pathophysiology of PD, we plan to advance methods for PD biomarker analyses and discovery through the following specific aims. First, we plan to develop new statistical techniques to reveal multimodal biomarkers for PD including imaging, clinical, and biologic variables. Secondly, we plan to utilize the massive clinical database to identify clinical risk factors for early stage PD. Thirdly, we will develop software equipped with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the multimodal biomarker detection methods.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8336879,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Screening procedure', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2012,378224,-0.007753704790387149
"A photographic method for human body composition assessment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of body composition, particularly fat and fat free mass, is vital to understanding many health-related conditions including obesity and sarcopenia, whose very definitions depend on assessment of fat and fat free mass, but also cachexia induced by HIV, cancer, and other diseases; multiple sclerosis; wasting in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy; eating disorders; proper growth in children; and yet others still. Nevertheless, challenges remain in measuring body composition. Existing methods beyond height, weight, and very simple anthropometry are still not the norm in large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical studies. This is because of concerns, depending on method, about cost, portability, time, radiation exposure, and accuracy. Calculation of body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) is a commonly used alternative, but is limited in that it is an assessment of body weight relative to height and not of body fatness per se. A hand-held device that could be carried by any individual, accurately assess fat mass and skeletal muscle mass, and be utilized without any discomfort to the subject, inexpensively, and without radiation exposure would be highly desirable. Evidence suggests that highly experienced trained observers can accurately estimate percentage of body fat by visual examination of subjects, but concerns about accuracy and subjectivity predominate. We hypothesize that we can develop a computer algorithm which can perform as or more accurately when analyzing photographic imagery data, will require no repeated retraining, and eliminate subjectivity. Our first specific aim is to develop a computer image analysis algorithm to accurately estimate adiposity and skeletal muscle mass from standardized photographic images in a bi-ethnic sample of men, women, and children. Our second specific aim is to validate the algorithm in a large diverse sample of men, women, and children.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity, loss of skeletal muscle with aging, and other body composition alterations are of profound public health importance. We propose a novel method for measuring the quantity of fat and skeletal muscle mass in humans quickly, painlessly, safely, accurately, and inexpensively that can subsequently be used in many large scale and remote studies.                  Obesity, loss of skeletal muscle with aging, and other body composition alterations are of profound public health importance.

"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research.       To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification; and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success.       Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs). However, growing resistance to the class of insecticide used on the nets threatens to make this protection ineffective. We propose to develop a new class of insecticide that is safe for ITN deployment, effective against current insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and less likely to promote emergence of new resistant strains.

"Technology-Based Training for Evidence-Based Practice in Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One important barrier to the successful dissemination of evidence-based practices (EBP) in mental health is the need to train therapists effectively and affordably. To date, the most common training methods in mental health tend to lead to increases in knowledge about EBP but not to skill development or behavior change. The present study will integrate state-of-the art technologies, prior literature on therapist training, and learning theory to develop an accessible and engaging practice component for a traditional online EBP training, with the goal of increasing trainees' skill in a specific EBP in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, the proposed study will have two phases: first, it will first develop a high-quality traditional online training to teach clinicians-in-training how to conduct evidence-based suicide risk assessment. In addition, it will develop an interactive computerized practice client with whom trainees can interact in order to rehearse newly learned concepts and build skill. These training components will be developed in consultation with content and technology experts to ensure the best possible quality of trainings. In its second phase, the present study will test the acceptability and efficacy of the virtual client practice tool by randomly assigning approximately 300 clinicians in training to receive the training as usual, the traditional online training alone, or the traditional online training plus the virtual practice component. It is anticipated that trainees interacting with the practice client will report higher training satisfaction, will show higher training use, and will obtain higher scores on questionnaires and simulations measuring skill in risk assessment than trainees receiving the training as usual or the traditional online training only. Trainees' risk assessment knowledge will also be measured, although no group differences are expected in this domain. The proposed study is a randomized-controlled trial, with measures collected at baseline, post-training, and follow-up (60 days). Trainees who agree to participate will be given access to the study measures (satisfaction, knowledge, and skill) online. Training use will be unobtrusively measured through automated recording of training access data. Planned data analyses will use hierarchical linear regression to predict scores on each study outcome from group status, controlling for training program. Any variables failing a randomization check will also be controlled for. Hierarchical linear modeling will allow for analysis of repeated measures while accounting for the nested structure of the proposed dataset (trainees nested within courses). The proposed study addresses one of the four primary objectives of the NIH: to ""help close the gap between the development of new, research-tested interventions and their wide-spread use by those most in need"" (Strategic Objective 4). The proposed study is also consistent with the goal of this funding mechanism to improve the quality of the training environment. Finally, by developing a potentially cost-effective therapist training tool that can be easily deployed to remote areas, it has the potential to improve the quality of care to underserved populations and contribute to the NIH goal of eliminating health disparities.          Several specific forms of assessment and psychotherapy have been developed for common youth mental health problems, which are both science-based and known to work better than usual assessment and treatments. However, these evidence-based practices are not widely used in community agencies. This is partly because current methods for training therapists are either affordable but do not lead to changes in therapist behavior or client outcomes (e.g., brief workshops), or are effective in changing therapist behavior but are more time, resource, and cost-intensive than most agencies can afford (e.g., adequate ongoing supervision and consultation). The present study will employ advanced but widely available technologies to develop an engaging, affordable, standardized tool for training therapists that offers therapists the opportunity to practice skills repeatedly in a realistic and safe environment where they receive immediate feedback. By establishing the acceptability and feasibility of this tool, the current study has the potential to advance the field's knowledge of how to effectively train therapists in general, and of how to disseminate evidence-based practices to settings where they are most needed. In particular, if successful the proposed training practice tool can easily and affordably be deployed to even remote and rural areas to improve therapist training in those settings. As such, the proposed study could help improve the quality of care received by such typically underserved populations in order to help reduce health disparities. In addition, by applying this tool to a broad and important public health concern such as adolescent suicide risk assessment, the study also has the potential to directly enhance therapists' skill and confidence in conducting state-of-the-science, sensitive risk assessments using empirically grounded strategies, which could, in turn, help them save lives.

"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects. Other specific aims of the project include the application of the proposed methods to two national data sets collected, respectively, from the Louisiana Child Health Study and the Heartbeat! Project, and the dissemination of a user-friendly software program for increasing the potential impact of the project.

"Bacterial colonization, inflammation and its role in carcinogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that over 20% of fatal cancers or about 2.1 million cases per year worldwide can be attributed to viral or bacterial infections, suggesting the tremendous potential of controlling microbe-related processes for cancer prevention. Although viral infections have been associated with cancer, the involvement of bacteria has also recently received attention, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that studies on the role of bacteria in cancer progressions are warranted. Important mechanisms by which bacterial agents may promote carcinogenesis include chronic infection, inflammation, immune evasion and immune suppression. Our overall hypothesis is that the bacterial colonization is associated with chronic inflammation which has the capacity to support oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) progression. The oral cavity and OSCC represent a unique opportunity to study the bacterial association with cancer because: (1) the microbiota of the oral cavity is well documented; and (2) the ease of sample collection. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that the bacterial colonization is altered in OSCC and dysplasia as compared to adjacent normal mucosa. We will determine the difference between the bacterial colonization (cultivable and non-cultivable) in OSCC, epithelial dysplasia, vs. adjacent normal mucosa. Using 400 bp fragments of the 16S rDNA gene and high throughput 454 pyrosequencing we will determine the relative abundance and species richness of the bacterial population in these sample groups. Artificial Intelligence analysis will be used to discover a pattern of bacterial phylotypes that are represented in OSCC, epithelial dysplasia, and normal mucosa. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that the colonization of dysplastic lesions and OSCC by bacterial pathogens is associated with chronic inflammation. We will use immunohistochemistry to compare the composition and quantity of the inflammatory cell infiltrate and evaluate the cytokine profile in the same tissue samples of OSCC, dysplasia, and normal mucosa used in Aim 1. The differences in bacterial profile between OSCC tissue and normal mucosa and the similarities in bacterial profile for OSCC and dysplasia will be used to develop a bacterial profile of OSCC which in association with inflammatory factors will serve as an indicator of risk for OSCC. We expect that understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will open novel approaches to direct the course of future interventions and prevention strategies by controlling the infectious agent, which are the approaches now used for managing Helicobacter pylori related gastric cancer.      Public Health Relevance: Understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will lead to patient oriented research where one may be able to assess OSCC risk by measuring bacterial profile in oral tissue of a person. The study will direct the course of future intervention and prevention strategies for this pathological condition.           Narrative Understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will lead to patient oriented research where one may be able to assess OSCC risk by measuring bacterial profile in oral tissue of a person.

"A New Approach to Compute PM2.5 for Health Impact Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental air quality impacts human well-being and disease, but the availability of air quality data is limited to selected locations because of the complexity involved in its measurement. Among air pollutants, PM2.5 is of the greatest concern. These particles are not captured by the lungs' natural defenses and can be inhaled deeply, where they can cause health problems ranging from asthma attacks to heart disease.  PM2.5 currently is measured primarily by ground monitoring stations located at approximately 320 EPA sites, providing limited local geographic coverage. However, there are satellites that make a variety of aerosol observations and provide a daily global picture of atmospheric particulates in the form of aerosol optical depth (AOD). Scientists have attempted to compute ground-level PM2.5 (GLP) from these AOD data. However, the multivariate nonlinear relationship between AOD and PM2.5 imposes limitations in computing GLP using satellite data. This project proposes to overcome these limitations by computing reliable GLP via a new methodology which has already been tested and validated.  The study has two specific aims: (1) develop satellite-derived daily GLP estimates for the contiguous U.S., and (2) examine spatial and temporal associations between GLP exposure and hospital visits for asthma exacerbation in Mississippi. Using our methodology, we will generate daily GLP data for a 12-month period at a resolution of 0.10x0.10 (~10x10km2), providing approximately 82,000 data points as opposed to about 300 data points available daily from EPA ground monitoring stations within the contiguous U.S. We will address the nonlinear relationship between PM2.5 and AOD which is a function of humidity, temperature, surface pressure, surface wind speed, surface type, boundary layer height, and AOD by accounting for these variables using a machine learning process. The AOD that will be used in this process will be generated by merging AOD data from multiple satellite sensors. Meteorological data will come from NOAA NCEP. Surface type data will be obtained from the satellite-identified vegetation index. Boundary layer height, which is the mixed layer of the atmosphere closest to the ground where people live and work, will come from CALIPSO data which provides vertical profiles of atmospheric aerosol extinction.  Information on GLP levels will allow the scientific community to better understand health impacts from exposure to low, moderate, or high levels of PM2.5. Moreover, in places where PM2.5 levels are elevated only occasionally, such as Mississippi, the short-term health impact of increases in PM2.5 can be studied more precisely. National GLP data will be made available to other researchers to facilitate future explorations of how PM2.5 exposure impacts a wide range of health conditions, thereby making possible more timely prophylactic treatment, improving healthcare system preparedness, and better informing public health policymaking.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Among air pollutants, particulates 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller (PM2.5) have the greatest impact on human health because they are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, making allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions worse. The proposed study will provide daily estimates of ground-level PM2.5 for the entire contiguous U.S. so that researchers can study how it affects disease at various locations in the country.

"Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines continued collaboration between the Malaria Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Malaria Epidemiology Section of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support CDC partners in malaria endemic countries in the conduct of collaborative research to improve the control of malaria in Africa and in Indonesia and to coordinate international research initiatives for malaria control.  LSTM, on behalf of the Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) Consortium, will coordinate research strategy development between CDC and other International partners in Europe, Australia and endemic countries for future studies of the control of malaria in pregnancy. In addition, a range of research projects will be conducted jointly between LSTM, CDC and the overseas partners of CDC in Indonesia (the Eijkman Institute, Jakarta) and in western Kenya (KEMRI-CDC field station). These fall under three main objectives: malaria control; malaria in pregnancy; and integrated disease control, following the outline of the original call. Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology. LSTM will also continue to provide technical advice to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Roll Back Malaria (RBM) in support of scaling up of malaria control interventions globally.              Project Narrative Collaboration between malaria Branch of CDC and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine to conduct research to improve the control of malaria in high risk populations, with a special emphasis on studies of the treatment and prevention of malaria in pregnancy in Indonesia and Kenya.",Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01),8131740,U01CK000146,[' '],NCEZID,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2011,160500,-0.0363538105195583
"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.                   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.           Project Narrative Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning.

"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           n/a","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",8094445,R01HD056029,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Empirical Research', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Play', 'Poaceae', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'data mining', 'developmental disease', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'haptics', 'insight', 'interest', 'lexical', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'social', 'statistics']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2011,176482,-0.05406165199893848
"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and  about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is  currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of  CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-  ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are,  they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms  2) Accommodative Mechanisms  3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms  There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term,  we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions  associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause. In phase t, we propose to:  ¿Clinically define CVS by observing the incidence of ocular surface abnormalities in symptomatic subjects  and compare them with an age and sex matched non-symptomatic control population  ¿Develop specialized micro-environment glasses to combat CVS symptoms  ¿Study the efficacy of micro-environment glasses in symptomatic and control populations  ¿Critically evaluate viability of CVS micro-environment glasses as a commercial product using both statistical   methods and subjective questionnaires n/a",Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS,8203808,R41EY015023,"['Address', 'Age', 'Asthenopia', 'Back', 'Blurred vision', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Burns', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Headache', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Neck', 'Pain', 'Phase', 'Population Control', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'Shoulder', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'combat', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'eye dryness', 'improved', 'ocular surface', 'sex']",NEI,"SEEFIT, INC.",R41,2011,47724,-0.035377300917749904
"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. This proposal seeks to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. This technology will be employed to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  Studies here will focus on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from a collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. The hypothesis to be tested is that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood.  Two potential modifiers will be examined: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress will be tested by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the ETC. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, once can begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations.

"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.           The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research.

"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research.       To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification; and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success.       Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs). However, growing resistance to the class of insecticide used on the nets threatens to make this protection ineffective.

"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects. Other specific aims of the project include the application of the proposed methods to two national data sets collected, respectively, from the Louisiana Child Health Study and the Heartbeat! Project, and the dissemination of a user-friendly software program for increasing the potential impact of the project.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a social epidemic, childhood obesity is the result of the interaction between many levels of personal behavior and risk factors, as well as obesogenic ecological factors that span many sources, including families, schools, and communities.

"Technology-Based Training for Evidence-Based Practice in Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One important barrier to the successful dissemination of evidence-based practices (EBP) in mental health is the need to train therapists effectively and affordably. To date, the most common training methods in mental health tend to lead to increases in knowledge about EBP but not to skill development or behavior change. The present study will integrate state-of-the art technologies, prior literature on therapist training, and learning theory to develop an accessible and engaging practice component for a traditional online EBP training, with the goal of increasing trainees' skill in a specific EBP in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, the proposed study will have two phases: first, it will first develop a high-quality traditional online training to teach clinicians-in-training how to conduct evidence-based suicide risk assessment. In addition, it will develop an interactive computerized practice client with whom trainees can interact in order to rehearse newly learned concepts and build skill. These training components will be developed in consultation with content and technology experts to ensure the best possible quality of trainings. In its second phase, the present study will test the acceptability and efficacy of the virtual client practice tool by randomly assigning approximately 300 clinicians in training to receive the training as usual, the traditional online training alone, or the traditional online training plus the virtual practice component. It is anticipated that trainees interacting with the practice client will report higher training satisfaction, will show higher training use, and will obtain higher scores on questionnaires and simulations measuring skill in risk assessment than trainees receiving the training as usual or the traditional online training only. Trainees' risk assessment knowledge will also be measured, although no group differences are expected in this domain. The proposed study is a randomized-controlled trial, with measures collected at baseline, post-training, and follow-up (60 days). Trainees who agree to participate will be given access to the study measures (satisfaction, knowledge, and skill) online. Training use will be unobtrusively measured through automated recording of training access data. Planned data analyses will use hierarchical linear regression to predict scores on each study outcome from group status, controlling for training program. Any variables failing a randomization check will also be controlled for. Hierarchical linear modeling will allow for analysis of repeated measures while accounting for the nested structure of the proposed dataset (trainees nested within courses). The proposed study addresses one of the four primary objectives of the NIH: to ""help close the gap between the development of new, research-tested interventions and their wide-spread use by those most in need"" (Strategic Objective 4). The proposed study is also consistent with the goal of this funding mechanism to improve the quality of the training environment. Finally, by developing a potentially cost-effective therapist training tool that can be easily deployed to remote areas, it has the potential to improve the quality of care to underserved populations and contribute to the NIH goal of eliminating health disparities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Several specific forms of assessment and psychotherapy have been developed for common youth mental health problems, which are both science-based and known to work better than usual assessment and treatments. However, these evidence-based practices are not widely used in community agencies. This is partly because current methods for training therapists are either affordable but do not lead to changes in therapist behavior or client outcomes (e.g., brief workshops), or are effective in changing therapist behavior but are more time, resource, and cost-intensive than most agencies can afford (e.g., adequate ongoing supervision and consultation). The present study will employ advanced but widely available technologies to develop an engaging, affordable, standardized tool for training therapists that offers therapists the opportunity to practice skills repeatedly in a realistic and safe environment where they receive immediate feedback. By establishing the acceptability and feasibility of this tool, the current study has the potential to advance the field's knowledge of how to effectively train therapists in general, and of how to disseminate evidence-based practices to settings where they are most needed. In particular, if successful the proposed training practice tool can easily and affordably be deployed to even remote and rural areas to improve therapist training in those settings. As such, the proposed study could help improve the quality of care received by such typically underserved populations in order to help reduce health disparities. In addition, by applying this tool to a broad and important public health concern such as adolescent suicide risk assessment, the study also has the potential to directly enhance therapists' skill and confidence in conducting state-of-the-science, sensitive risk assessments using empirically grounded strategies, which could, in turn, help them save lives.                Several specific forms of assessment and psychotherapy have been developed for common youth mental health problems, which are both science-based and known to work better than usual assessment and treatments.

"Bacterial colonization, inflammation and its role in carcinogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that over 20% of fatal cancers or about 2.1 million cases per year worldwide can be attributed to viral or bacterial infections, suggesting the tremendous potential of controlling microbe-related processes for cancer prevention. Although viral infections have been associated with cancer, the involvement of bacteria has also recently received attention, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that studies on the role of bacteria in cancer progressions are warranted. Important mechanisms by which bacterial agents may promote carcinogenesis include chronic infection, inflammation, immune evasion and immune suppression. Our overall hypothesis is that the bacterial colonization is associated with chronic inflammation which has the capacity to support oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) progression. The oral cavity and OSCC represent a unique opportunity to study the bacterial association with cancer because: (1) the microbiota of the oral cavity is well documented; and (2) the ease of sample collection. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that the bacterial colonization is altered in OSCC and dysplasia as compared to adjacent normal mucosa. We will determine the difference between the bacterial colonization (cultivable and non-cultivable) in OSCC, epithelial dysplasia, vs. adjacent normal mucosa. Using 400 bp fragments of the 16S rDNA gene and high throughput 454 pyrosequencing we will determine the relative abundance and species richness of the bacterial population in these sample groups. Artificial Intelligence analysis will be used to discover a pattern of bacterial phylotypes that are represented in OSCC, epithelial dysplasia, and normal mucosa. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that the colonization of dysplastic lesions and OSCC by bacterial pathogens is associated with chronic inflammation. We will use immunohistochemistry to compare the composition and quantity of the inflammatory cell infiltrate and evaluate the cytokine profile in the same tissue samples of OSCC, dysplasia, and normal mucosa used in Aim 1. The differences in bacterial profile between OSCC tissue and normal mucosa and the similarities in bacterial profile for OSCC and dysplasia will be used to develop a bacterial profile of OSCC which in association with inflammatory factors will serve as an indicator of risk for OSCC. We expect that understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will open novel approaches to direct the course of future interventions and prevention strategies by controlling the infectious agent, which are the approaches now used for managing Helicobacter pylori related gastric cancer.      Public Health Relevance: Understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will lead to patient oriented research where one may be able to assess OSCC risk by measuring bacterial profile in oral tissue of a person. The study will direct the course of future intervention and prevention strategies for this pathological condition.           Narrative Understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will lead to patient oriented research where one may be able to assess OSCC risk by measuring bacterial profile in oral tissue of a person.

"Institutional Collaboration between LSTM and CDC and Prevention on Malaria(U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines continued collaboration between the Malaria Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Malaria Epidemiology Section of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support CDC partners in malaria endemic countries in the conduct of collaborative research to improve the control of malaria in Africa and in Indonesia and to coordinate international research initiatives for malaria control.  LSTM, on behalf of the Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) Consortium, will coordinate research strategy development between CDC and other International partners in Europe, Australia and endemic countries for future studies of the control of malaria in pregnancy. In addition, a range of research projects will be conducted jointly between LSTM, CDC and the overseas partners of CDC in Indonesia (the Eijkman Institute, Jakarta) and in western Kenya (KEMRI-CDC field station). These fall under three main objectives: malaria control; malaria in pregnancy; and integrated disease control, following the outline of the original call. Several projects start in year 1 and reflect an extension of the joint activities as part of the existing cooperative agreement (CoAg) between LSTM and CDC's Malaria Branch. These include a study to develop tools to monitor antimalarial drug safety in early pregnancy and a survey to evaluate a new rapid assessment toolkit for the evaluation of access, delivery and use of interventions for malaria in pregnancy, both in western Kenya; the central coordination of a multi-country observational study in Africa to determine the effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) effectiveness, and two studies in Indonesia: a) a study evaluating the use of cell-phone technology to improve malaria surveillance by village based health-care workers in remote settings in Indonesia; b) evaluation of the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the control of malaria in pregnancy in remote settings. In addition, grant proposals will be written in years 1 and 2 to generate research funds for the activities planned in years 2-5, including studies of integrated approaches to disease control which combine screening for HIV with scheduled screening for malaria, syphilis and anemia, and use of intermittent screening and treatment of malaria in pregnancy. During the course of the CoAg, LSTM will provide technical support to CDC as requested for specific pharmacokinetic studies in HIV- infected adults, in children (age-based dosing) and in pregnant women (Mefloquine). Lastly, the activities include formal PhD training of individuals and short-term training in clinical trial methodology.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.           Project Narrative Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning.

"Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress has been made in developing and using accelerometer-based motion sensors for physical activity research. However, traditional methods of processing activity monitor data do not provide sufficient accuracy to satisfy current trends in the use of objective physical activity data in the research arena. The aims of this proposal address this weakness in accelerometer- based PA assessment methodologies: The specific aims are: 1) To develop and validate novel methods to process Actigraph accelerometer data to improve estimates of PA using powerful modern classification methods (classification trees, discriminant analyses, hidden Markov models, neural networks, regression splines, and support vector machines); 2) To compare these classification methods and traditional approaches for assessing PA in a controlled setting; 3) To compare the classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA in free living PA conditions and to select a recommended method; and 4) To correct for measurement error in summary estimates of habitual PA from the novel classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA. Our uniquely qualified multidisciplinary research group will address these aims by first developing innovative classification methods to identify specific activities in a laboratory setting, and then validating the models using data collected from known activities performed in both controlled laboratory environments and free- living situations. Based on the results of these studies, the classification methods will be refined, and estimates of PA behavior will be adjusted using statistical measurement error methods to derive more accurate estimates of PA. We have chosen the classification methods to include publicly available ""off-the shelf"" classification methods that others can easily use. The resulting data processing programs will be implemented in popular commercial software packages and made freely available. The results of the proposed investigations will move the field of PA assessment forward by providing innovative approaches to derive more accurate and detailed estimates of PA using a popular accelerometer-based PA monitor. This systematic approach will provide information leading to a clearer understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health and the physiological basis of this relationship.           n/a",Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity,7825424,R01CA121005,"['Address', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Health', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Qualifying', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'markov model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutritional epidemiology', 'programs', 'response', 'sensor', 'trend']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2010,185505,-0.0006350541910439628
"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months. Validity relative to self report, acceptability, and longitudinal compliance will be measured.          n/a",Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones,7895863,U01HL091737,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asia', 'Car Phone', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical activity scale', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shoes', 'Side', 'Software Design', 'Sports', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'cost', 'design', 'ergonomics', 'open source', 'prototype', 'remote sensor', 'sensor', 'social', 'software development', 'software systems']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U01,2010,534121,-0.006349742344880142
"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           n/a","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",7870420,R01HD056029,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Empirical Research', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Play', 'Poaceae', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'data mining', 'developmental disease', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'fenson', 'haptics', 'insight', 'interest', 'lexical', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'social', 'statistics']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2010,184005,-0.05406165199893848
"Advancing Physical Activity Measurement Using Pattern Recognition Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (01) Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention and specific Challenge Area 01-HL-101: Develop innovative technologies and measurements to assess and provide real-time feedback on behavioral and environmental exposures for disease onset and progression for heart, lung, and blood disease. In October, 2008 the US Department of Health and Human Services issued the first-ever federally mandated Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. The Guidelines reflect the view of the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (PAGAC) and are based on an extensive review of the scientific literature on physical activity (PA) and health. In their report, the PAGAC points out the limited knowledge of the dose-response relationship between PA and health, and identifies poor measures of PA exposure as a major contributing factor to this gap in knowledge. Our application directly addresses this issue by applying innovative technologies to measure PA dose in a free- living environment. We will use these technologies to examine if habitual PA performed outside of purposeful exercise influences biomarkers of cardiovascular health. Although insufficient PA clearly correlates with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), research evidence is equivocal regarding the effects of training on CVD risk factors (e.g. insulin action, triglycerides, blood pressure, and cholesterol). Research suggests increases in sedentary behavior may negate the benefits of training however this idea has not been explored experimentally. Our application will consider habitual free-living PA as a possible mechanism mediating the relationship between training and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In order to elucidate the relationship between PA and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk, it is critical that valid, objective measures are used to quantify PA. We propose to use novel analytic techniques known as artificial neural networks (ANN) to process accelerometer-based measurements of PA. The first part of this project (Aim 1) will examine the ANN's sensitivity to change in PA dose by applying the ANN technique to distinguish three distinct patterns of habitual PA - Sedentary, Moderately Active, and Very Active. These three conditions represent common activity patterns that impact health. Accurately assessing changes to habitual PA levels that are relevant to public health will advance the field by further establishing a technique for application in population surveillance research and detection of changes in PA consequent to an intervention. The second part of this project (Aim 2) will apply the ANN methodology to examine the effect of free-living activity and inactivity levels, performed outside of training, on insulin action, blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol, and cardiorespiratory fitness following a 12-week exercise training trial in previously sedentary individuals with an elevated risk for CVD. Results from this study have the potential to impact how clinical exercise trials are conducted (e.g. require objective monitoring of PA outside of an exercise training trial) and how exercise is prescribed (e.g. reducing sedentary time AND maintaining sufficient PA). The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health. To address this challenge we will apply and validate innovative accelerometer-based technologies for measuring physical activity to assess its sensitivity to detecting changes in dose of physical activity and to monitor activity outside of a training program designed to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. Through improved measures of physical activity this project will promote a better understanding of how the dose of physical activity affects selected health outcomes.                  Project Narrative The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health.

"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research.       To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification; and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success.       Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs). However, growing resistance to the class of insecticide used on the nets threatens to make this protection ineffective. We propose to develop a new class of insecticide that is safe for ITN deployment, effective against current insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and less likely to promote emergence of new resistant strains.              Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs).

"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects. Other specific aims of the project include the application of the proposed methods to two national data sets collected, respectively, from the Louisiana Child Health Study and the Heartbeat! Project, and the dissemination of a user-friendly software program for increasing the potential impact of the project.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a social epidemic, childhood obesity is the result of the interaction between many levels of personal behavior and risk factors, as well as obesogenic ecological factors that span many sources, including families, schools, and communities. Using a broad and interdisciplinary team of clinical and methodology scientists, this project develops advanced analytic tools that could help clinicians better understand the mechanisms of how multiple levels of risk factors lead to childhood obesity, including the relative importance of the risk factors.              Project Narrative As a social epidemic, childhood obesity is the result of the interaction between many levels of personal behavior and risk factors, as well as obesogenic ecological factors that span many sources, including families, schools, and communities.

"Clinical Validation of BCT - Phase II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fracture risk assessment is integral to the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, a devastating clinical condition of which over 40 million Americans are at risk. Due to limitations in areal BMD measures obtained from 2D DXA scans - the current clinical standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis - it has recently become clear that those at risk of osteoporotic fracture need to be better identified. A 3D biomechanics-based technique, which we term Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT), addresses this need through a combination of engineering finite element analysis, 3D quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and bone fracture biomechanics. The main outcome parameter of BCT is an estimate of the biomechanical risk of a bone fracture that accounts for such factors as the patient's 3D bone geometry and distribution of bone density, body-weight, height, trochanteric soft tissue thickness (for hip fractures), muscle moment arm (for spine), and the age-related risk of sustaining an overload event (such as a fall or lifting of a heavy object with back bent). In the larger context of translating BCT to clinical practice, we seek in this Phase II SBIR project to test the overall hypothesis that BCT is a better predictor of osteoporotic fracture than is areal BMD, for both hip and spine fracture and for both women and men. In Phase I of this project, we successfully applied this technique to explain observed age-related trends in hip fracture rates. For Phase II, we plan in our first Aim to refine our BCT technique to produce a fully automated, highly reliable and highly accurate software suite with the capability to analyze CT scans acquired for any medical test with coverage of the hip and/or spine without an external calibration phantom. For Aim 2, in order to ensure optimal prediction of clinical fractures, we will further refine our overall BCT process by calibrating results from the two cohorts (the Mayo Clinic cohort of 750 men and women in Rochester MN, and the MrOS cohort of 3,500 men in six U.S. locations). Issues to be resolved in this calibration process include determining optimal methods for measuring soft tissue thickness, muscle moment arms, and spine loading. This analysis will also enable us to calibrate our function for age- related risk of sustaining an overload event, which may depend on both fracture type (hip vs. spine) and sex. In Aim 3, we will compile normative data for BCT outcomes, critical information for interpretation of clinical results. Having refined and calibrated the overall BCT technique and identified the most successful BCT predictors of clinical fracture in the Mayo and MrOS cohorts, we will proceed in Aim 4 to test the validity of these predictors in a fully prospective manner, without any further modification of the BCT technique. For this, we will analyze the AGES cohort of 5,500 women and men in Reykjavik, Iceland, for incident hip and spine fracture. Taken together, this multi-cohort international validation study will provide new insight into osteoporotic fracture etiology, important advancements for the BCT method, and a thorough evaluation of BCT clinical performance.

"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months.

"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           n/a","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",7635904,R01HD056029,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Empirical Research', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Play', 'Poaceae', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'data mining', 'developmental disease', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'fenson', 'haptics', 'insight', 'interest', 'lexical', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'social', 'statistics']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2009,186028,-0.05406165199893848
"Advancing Physical Activity Measurement Using Pattern Recognition Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (01) Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention and specific Challenge Area 01-HL-101: Develop innovative technologies and measurements to assess and provide real-time feedback on behavioral and environmental exposures for disease onset and progression for heart, lung, and blood disease. In October, 2008 the US Department of Health and Human Services issued the first-ever federally mandated Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. The Guidelines reflect the view of the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (PAGAC) and are based on an extensive review of the scientific literature on physical activity (PA) and health. In their report, the PAGAC points out the limited knowledge of the dose-response relationship between PA and health, and identifies poor measures of PA exposure as a major contributing factor to this gap in knowledge. Our application directly addresses this issue by applying innovative technologies to measure PA dose in a free- living environment. We will use these technologies to examine if habitual PA performed outside of purposeful exercise influences biomarkers of cardiovascular health. Although insufficient PA clearly correlates with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), research evidence is equivocal regarding the effects of training on CVD risk factors (e.g. insulin action, triglycerides, blood pressure, and cholesterol). Research suggests increases in sedentary behavior may negate the benefits of training however this idea has not been explored experimentally. Our application will consider habitual free-living PA as a possible mechanism mediating the relationship between training and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In order to elucidate the relationship between PA and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk, it is critical that valid, objective measures are used to quantify PA. We propose to use novel analytic techniques known as artificial neural networks (ANN) to process accelerometer-based measurements of PA. The first part of this project (Aim 1) will examine the ANN's sensitivity to change in PA dose by applying the ANN technique to distinguish three distinct patterns of habitual PA - Sedentary, Moderately Active, and Very Active. These three conditions represent common activity patterns that impact health. Accurately assessing changes to habitual PA levels that are relevant to public health will advance the field by further establishing a technique for application in population surveillance research and detection of changes in PA consequent to an intervention. The second part of this project (Aim 2) will apply the ANN methodology to examine the effect of free-living activity and inactivity levels, performed outside of training, on insulin action, blood pressure, triglycerides, cholesterol, and cardiorespiratory fitness following a 12-week exercise training trial in previously sedentary individuals with an elevated risk for CVD. Results from this study have the potential to impact how clinical exercise trials are conducted (e.g. require objective monitoring of PA outside of an exercise training trial) and how exercise is prescribed (e.g. reducing sedentary time AND maintaining sufficient PA). The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health. To address this challenge we will apply and validate innovative accelerometer-based technologies for measuring physical activity to assess its sensitivity to detecting changes in dose of physical activity and to monitor activity outside of a training program designed to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. Through improved measures of physical activity this project will promote a better understanding of how the dose of physical activity affects selected health outcomes.                  Project Narrative The Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee advocates improved measures of physical activity exposure in order to elucidate the relationship between physical activity dose and health.

"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malari    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research.       To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification; and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success.       Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs). However, growing resistance to the class of insecticide used on the nets threatens to make this protection ineffective.

"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects. Other specific aims of the project include the application of the proposed methods to two national data sets collected, respectively, from the Louisiana Child Health Study and the Heartbeat! Project, and the dissemination of a user-friendly software program for increasing the potential impact of the project.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a social epidemic, childhood obesity is the result of the interaction between many levels of personal behavior and risk factors, as well as obesogenic ecological factors that span many sources, including families, schools, and communities. Using a broad and interdisciplinary team of clinical and methodology scientists, this project develops advanced analytic tools that could help clinicians better understand the mechanisms of how multiple levels of risk factors lead to childhood obesity, including the relative importance of the risk factors.              Project Narrative As a social epidemic, childhood obesity is the result of the interaction between many levels of personal behavior and risk factors, as well as obesogenic ecological factors that span many sources, including families, schools, and communities.

"Clinical Validation of BCT - Phase II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fracture risk assessment is integral to the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, a devastating clinical condition of which over 40 million Americans are at risk. Due to limitations in areal BMD measures obtained from 2D DXA scans - the current clinical standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis - it has recently become clear that those at risk of osteoporotic fracture need to be better identified. A 3D biomechanics-based technique, which we term Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT), addresses this need through a combination of engineering finite element analysis, 3D quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and bone fracture biomechanics. The main outcome parameter of BCT is an estimate of the biomechanical risk of a bone fracture that accounts for such factors as the patient's 3D bone geometry and distribution of bone density, body-weight, height, trochanteric soft tissue thickness (for hip fractures), muscle moment arm (for spine), and the age-related risk of sustaining an overload event (such as a fall or lifting of a heavy object with back bent). In the larger context of translating BCT to clinical practice, we seek in this Phase II SBIR project to test the overall hypothesis that BCT is a better predictor of osteoporotic fracture than is areal BMD, for both hip and spine fracture and for both women and men. In Phase I of this project, we successfully applied this technique to explain observed age-related trends in hip fracture rates. For Phase II, we plan in our first Aim to refine our BCT technique to produce a fully automated, highly reliable and highly accurate software suite with the capability to analyze CT scans acquired for any medical test with coverage of the hip and/or spine without an external calibration phantom. For Aim 2, in order to ensure optimal prediction of clinical fractures, we will further refine our overall BCT process by calibrating results from the two cohorts (the Mayo Clinic cohort of 750 men and women in Rochester MN, and the MrOS cohort of 3,500 men in six U.S. locations). Issues to be resolved in this calibration process include determining optimal methods for measuring soft tissue thickness, muscle moment arms, and spine loading. This analysis will also enable us to calibrate our function for age- related risk of sustaining an overload event, which may depend on both fracture type (hip vs. spine) and sex. In Aim 3, we will compile normative data for BCT outcomes, critical information for interpretation of clinical results. Having refined and calibrated the overall BCT technique and identified the most successful BCT predictors of clinical fracture in the Mayo and MrOS cohorts, we will proceed in Aim 4 to test the validity of these predictors in a fully prospective manner, without any further modification of the BCT technique. For this, we will analyze the AGES cohort of 5,500 women and men in Reykjavik, Iceland, for incident hip and spine fracture. Taken together, this multi-cohort international validation study will provide new insight into osteoporotic fracture etiology, important advancements for the BCT method, and a thorough evaluation of BCT clinical performance. This project should therefore have a significant impact on osteoporosis research and clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Successful translation of BCT to clinical practice has the potential to greatly improve non-invasive assessment of fracture risk, which would represent an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

"Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress has been made in developing and using accelerometer-based motion sensors for physical activity research.

The aims of this proposal address this weakness in accelerometer- based PA assessment methodologies: The specific aims are: 1) To develop and validate novel methods to process Actigraph accelerometer data to improve estimates of PA using powerful modern classification methods (classification trees, discriminant analyses, hidden Markov models, neural networks, regression splines, and support vector machines); 2) To compare these classification methods and traditional approaches for assessing PA in a controlled setting; 3) To compare the classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA in free living PA conditions and to select a recommended method; and 4) To correct for measurement error in summary estimates of habitual PA from the novel classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA. Our uniquely qualified multidisciplinary research group will address these aims by first developing innovative classification methods to identify specific activities in a laboratory setting, and then validating the models using data collected from known activities performed in both controlled laboratory environments and free- living situations. Based on the results of these studies, the classification methods will be refined, and estimates of PA behavior will be adjusted using statistical measurement error methods to derive more accurate estimates of PA. We have chosen the classification methods to include publicly available ""off-the shelf"" classification methods that others can easily use. The resulting data processing programs will be implemented in popular commercial software packages and made freely available. The results of the proposed investigations will move the field of PA assessment forward by providing innovative approaches to derive more accurate and detailed estimates of PA using a popular accelerometer-based PA monitor.

"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration. By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wireless accelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at the hip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometers will be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permitting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users. After two rounds of iterative technical development, each with laboratory validation conducted at Stanford, the technology will be deployed with 50 typical phone users for 10 months. Validity relative to self report, acceptability, and longitudinal compliance will be measured.          n/a",Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones,7489819,U01HL091737,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asia', 'Car Phone', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hip region structure', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical activity scale', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shoes', 'Side', 'Software Design', 'Sports', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'cost', 'design', 'ergonomics', 'open source', 'prototype', 'remote sensor', 'sensor', 'social', 'software development', 'software systems']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U01,2008,637604,-0.006349742344880142
"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           n/a","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",7490715,R01HD056029,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Empirical Research', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Play', 'Poaceae', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Study', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'data mining', 'developmental disease', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'fenson', 'haptics', 'insight', 'interest', 'lexical', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'social', 'statistics']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2008,186183,-0.05406165199893848
"Towards a cognitive framework for understanding cellular behavior Abstract Free-living cells display strong genome-wide transcriptional responses to changes in individual environmental parameters such as oxygen and temperature. Such transcriptional dynamics are thought to be the basis of a homeostatic response that attempts to reverse the immediate intracellular consequences resulting from the specific change in the environment. I present an alternative interpretation where transcriptional responses reflect a multifaceted behavioral program in response to global changes in the environment that are anticipated to follow the perturbation. This results from the fact that native microbial habitats are highly structured, giving rise to strong correlations between environmental parameters. Over geological timescales, such correlations can be internalized through an ""associative learning"" process that shapes the connectivity and dynamics of regulatory networks. Such internal models should allow microbes to predict the future trajectory of the environment based on immediate sensory information. We have seen evidence of this anticipatory behavior in responses of the bacterium Escherichia coli to changes in temperature and oxygen that correspond to transitions between the outside environment and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. These internal representations seem to reflect a true associative learning paradigm, since they show plasticity upon exposure to novel environments. These phenomena increasingly demand that we interpret microbial behaviors from a cognitive perspective, much as we do for understanding animal behaviors. I propose a multi-faceted research program aimed at 1) establishing that these phenomena, indeed, represent cognitive modeling of microbial habitats, 2) revealing the underlying network mechanisms, and 3) exploring associative learning of novel environments through laboratory experimental evolution. The proposed work establishes deep connections between the disparate fields of microbial ecology, regulatory network evolution, and behavior. In so doing, it challenges the dominance of the century-old notion of homeostasis, with fundamental implications for how we understand and control microbial behavior, especially in the context of disease. n/a",Towards a cognitive framework for understanding cellular behavior,7555864,DP1OD003787,"['Acidity', 'Acids', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Behavior', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Association Learning', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacteroides fragilis', 'Base Pairing', 'Basic Science', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Carbon', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemotaxis', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Coupling', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Cytochromes', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Depth', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Drops', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Employee Strikes', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Global Change', 'Growth', 'Habitats', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Homeostasis', 'Homo', 'Human', 'Hybridization Array', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Physiology', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Detection', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'New York', 'Nitrogen', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oral cavity', 'Organism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Output', 'Oxidases', 'Oxygen', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Perception', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Psychological Manipulation', 'Psychology', 'Pulse taking', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Salts', 'Science', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'abstracting', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'cytochrome c oxidase', 'day', 'density', 'design', 'electron donor', 'enteric pathogen', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'life history', 'microbial', 'microbial disease', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'null mutation', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'quorum sensing', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'response', 'second messenger', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",OD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,DP1,2008,805000,-0.02354168293075192
"Rett syndrome: determinants of outcome and burden DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This population-based study will follow the current cohort of live (n=225) cases with Rett syndrome in Australia for a further five years. New cases ascertained during the study period will also be included. It will describe the natural history of Rett syndrome and assess its impact on resource utilization and the economic and social burden on families and community in comparison with Down syndrome and a normal comparison group. Baseline data on communication, mobility, symptoms and classification have been gathered on the cohort since 1993. In 2000 data were collected on functional ability in daily living, behavior, hand function, medical conditions, and use of health and education services. Mutation data, collected on 80 percent of cases will be continued. A questionnaire has been developed, piloted and will be used to collect data on function, health and well-being of the Rett syndrome subjects and family in 2002, 2004 and 2006. Data will be gathered for the Down syndrome comparison group in 2003. Participants will respond via paper-based or through secure on-line formats. Optical scanning or on-line data capture will be used for data entry. In 2003 and 2005 clinical assessments or clinical file review will provide EEG, ECG, blood parameters, bone densitometry and autonomic nervous system data. A video protocol developed in 2001 to record functional ability will be extended to include gross motor and oral motor function, hand apraxia, gait assessment and language function. Serial videos collected in 2003 and again in 2005 will enable us to monitor changes over time and the effect of therapy or surgery. Yearly telephone interviews to families will record anthropometric data, current medication usage and update previously collected family tree data. Every two years a validated questionnaire to identify epilepsy type will be included.

"Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress has been made in developing and using accelerometer-based motion sensors for physical activity research. However, traditional methods of processing activity monitor data do not provide sufficient accuracy to satisfy current trends in the use of objective physical activity data in the research arena. The aims of this proposal address this weakness in accelerometer- based PA assessment methodologies: The specific aims are: 1) To develop and validate novel methods to process Actigraph accelerometer data to improve estimates of PA using powerful modern classification methods (classification trees, discriminant analyses, hidden Markov models, neural networks, regression splines, and support vector machines); 2) To compare these classification methods and traditional approaches for assessing PA in a controlled setting; 3) To compare the classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA in free living PA conditions and to select a recommended method; and 4) To correct for measurement error in summary estimates of habitual PA from the novel classification methods and traditional approaches for quantifying PA. Our uniquely qualified multidisciplinary research group will address these aims by first developing innovative classification methods to identify specific activities in a laboratory setting, and then validating the models using data collected from known activities performed in both controlled laboratory environments and free- living situations. Based on the results of these studies, the classification methods will be refined, and estimates of PA behavior will be adjusted using statistical measurement error methods to derive more accurate estimates of PA. We have chosen the classification methods to include publicly available ""off-the shelf"" classification methods that others can easily use. The resulting data processing programs will be implemented in popular commercial software packages and made freely available. The results of the proposed investigations will move the field of PA assessment forward by providing innovative approaches to derive more accurate and detailed estimates of PA using a popular accelerometer-based PA monitor. This systematic approach will provide information leading to a clearer understanding of the dose-response relationship between PA and health and the physiological basis of this relationship.           n/a",Novel Analytic Techniques to Assess Physical Activity,7262592,R01CA121005,"['Address', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease regression', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Environment', 'Health', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Qualifying', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'markov model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutritional epidemiology', 'programs', 'response', 'sensor', 'trend']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R01,2007,263847,-0.0006350541910439628
"Enabling Population-Scale Physical Activity Measurement on Common Mobile Phones The primary aim of this U01 project is the technical development, deployment, and evaluation of hardware and software technology that will enable population-scale, longitudinal measurement of physical activity using common mobile phones. Mobile phones available in Asia and soon in the U.S. already include internal accelerometers and low-power wireless communication capabilities. This study will investigate how to use these computing devices for accurate measurement of physical activity type, intensity and bout duration .By exploiting consumer expenditures on phones that many Americans will purchase, maintain, and carry, it may be possible to run large-scale studies where the physical activity of hundreds of thousands of participants is measured and remotely monitored for months or years at an affordable cost. Wirelessaccelerometers designed at MIT will be redesigned so that they can send data to common mobile phones available in 2011. Laboratory testing using the current version of the sensors will be used to compare the relative information gain that can be obtained by combining the phone accelerometer data and data obtained by wearing one or more wireless sensors on different convenient body locations (e.g., in a watch or bag, on a shoe, at thehip, etc.). Optimal but practical configurations of accelerometerswill be determined so that software running on the mobile phone can automatically detect specific physical activities such as brisk walking, running, cycling, climbing stairs, sweeping, playing sports, etc. Technical challenges that will be addressed by the sensor and software design include, (1) obtaining practical battery life, (2) acquiring physical activity data at high temporal resolution, (3) enabling person-specific customization of the detection algorithms, (4) addressing practical end-user concerns about ergonomics, comfort, and social acceptability, (5) permiting real-time and low-cost remote monitoring and maintenance for studies with hundreds of thousands of phone users, and (4) enabling use of other off-the-shelf sensor devices, such as heart rate monitors, as they become available. A participatory design process will be employed to develop strategies for obtaining longitudinal compliance from typical phone users.

"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           n/a","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",7298428,R01HD056029,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Empirical Research', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Play', 'Poaceae', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Study', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'data mining', 'developmental disease', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'fenson', 'haptics', 'insight', 'interest', 'lexical', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'social', 'statistics']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2007,217951,-0.05406165199893848
"Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary lifestyle is directly associated with disease and reduced quality of life. While the general United States population is suffering from an epidemic of sedentary lifestyle, Latinos are even more sedentary than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Notably, Latinos suffer from greater rates of morbidity and mortality of conditions associated with being sedentary than non-Hispanic whites. One concern is that due to cultural artifacts, socioeconomic circumstances, and language barriers, Latinos have limited access to public health interventions that promote active lifestyles. Modern behavioral informatics interventions that use theory-based computer-run expert systems show great promise to provide more effective interventions for hard-to-reach populations at lower cost. The present application is in response to PA-04-153, 'Health Disparities Among Minority and Underserved Women.' We aim to both culturally and linguistically modify an evidence-based, inidvidually tailored intervention, founded on the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory, to target sedentary Latinas. This print-based, expert system intervention has been developed and tested by Dr. Bess Marcus and her team, who have spent 18 years developing programs to increase physical activity in sedentary adults. The study will involve two phases: 1) a formative research period in which 100 Latinas will be recruited to provide data on how to modify the current tailored intervention to be culturally congruent and 2) a pilot randomized trial with 80 recruited Latinas to test the modified intervention against off-the-shelf bilingual health educational materials for Latinas. The formative research phase will involve an iterative process of qualitative data collection and intervention modification, with: 1) translation from English to Spanish; 2) an initial round of exploratory focus groups to obtain data on unique themes to include in the modified intervention; 3) a second round of confirmatory focus groups to examine responses to modified intervention materials; and 4) a series of intensive individual cognitive interviews to examine readability and comprehension, consistency of perception of materials with theory, and conceptual integrity of the intervention materials across English and Spanish. The pilot study will provide data on feasibility as well as on effect size of the modified intervention to inform a future clinical trial. Secondary analyses will explore differences in intervention effect based on levels of acculturation and of ethnic identity.             n/a",Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas,7197865,R21NR009864,"['Hispanic Americans', 'artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'focus groups', 'lifestyle', 'public health']",NINR,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R21,2006,210300,-0.004912042054805205
"HIV Risk Behavior in out-of school rural Af. Am. Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent epidemiological evidence indicates that the risk of contracting HIV is increasing among African American young adults living in the rural South. African American communities in rural Georgia are characterized by chronic unemployment and poverty along with a dearth of health and educational resources. Young adults in these communities face significant barriers to adequate employment and higher education. Many respond to this lack of opportunity and the resulting economic pressure by engaging in high-risk behavior, including substance use and unprotected sexual activity. Although young adults attending higher education have been studied extensively, barriers to obtaining valid samples have prevented empirical research on the risk and protective factors that affect rural African American young adults who do not attend college. The research proposed in this R-21 application addresses the public health need to develop new approaches to obtaining valid samples of hard-to-reach members of populations at risk for HIV and substance use and to identify the protective factors that dissuade them from engaging in high risk behaviors. The objectives of this study are to (1) test the feasibility of Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) for obtaining a sample of rural African American young adults age 18-21 who are out of school and living in resource- poor, rural environments, and (2) evaluate a model of the personal, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors that explain high-risk sexual behavior among these young people. RDS is a novel technique that combines ""snowball sampling"" with a mathematical model that weights the sample to compensate for its non-random nature. RDS will be used to obtain a sample of 240 rural African American young adults. Data will be gathered to evaluate a heuristic model that includes the following predictors: socioeconomic and personal stressors; the negative emotions these stressors induce; support and socialization from prosocial adults; intrapersonal protective processes, including a future orientation, self-regulation, emotion regulation, and racial identity; affiliations with risk-taking peers and sexual partners; and antecedents of HIV-related risk behavior, such as behavioral intentions and attitudes toward sexually protective behaviors.           n/a",HIV Risk Behavior in out-of school rural Af.

"An Intelligent Physical Activity Monitor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a recognized need for specific and reliable information regarding the dose/response relationships between physical activity and health for all segments of the population. New methods for assessing physical activity and energy expenditure (EE) in free-living populations are needed before a systematic evaluation and interpretation of these dose-response relationships between physical activity and specific health-related results can be undertaken. Our objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of a low-cost, unobtrusive acceleration pattern acquisition and analysis system. This instrument will identify and quantify the physical activities that generate these patterns.

"Rett syndrome: determinants of outcome and burden DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This population-based study will follow the current cohort of live (n=225) cases with Rett syndrome in Australia for a further five years. New cases ascertained during the study period will also be included. It will describe the natural history of Rett syndrome and assess its impact on resource utilization and the economic and social burden on families and community in comparison with Down syndrome and a normal comparison group. Baseline data on communication, mobility, symptoms and classification have been gathered on the cohort since 1993. In 2000 data were collected on functional ability in daily living, behavior, hand function, medical conditions, and use of health and education services. Mutation data, collected on 80 percent of cases will be continued. A questionnaire has been developed, piloted and will be used to collect data on function, health and well-being of the Rett syndrome subjects and family in 2002, 2004 and 2006. Data will be gathered for the Down syndrome comparison group in 2003. Participants will respond via paper-based or through secure on-line formats. Optical scanning or on-line data capture will be used for data entry. In 2003 and 2005 clinical assessments or clinical file review will provide EEG, ECG, blood parameters, bone densitometry and autonomic nervous system data. A video protocol developed in 2001 to record functional ability will be extended to include gross motor and oral motor function, hand apraxia, gait assessment and language function. Serial videos collected in 2003 and again in 2005 will enable us to monitor changes over time and the effect of therapy or surgery. Yearly telephone interviews to families will record anthropometric data, current medication usage and update previously collected family tree data. Every two years a validated questionnaire to identify epilepsy type will be included. Resource data to determine the direct, indirect and opportunity costs associated with Rett syndrome will be compared with a normal and Down syndrome comparison group. Data analysis will use multiple regression models to examine effects of different variables on child and family level outcomes and discriminant analysis, recursive partitioning and machine learning to identify genotype/phenotype associations at the individual child level.

"Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management   DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity        has increased dramatically over the last two decades. Overweight and obesity,        the second leading preventable cause of death, poses a major public health           challenge in that it increases the risk of chronic diseases, including coronary      heart disease, and all-cause mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight             management are costly and serve only a small percentage of individuals.              Population-based behavior change programs are needed to reach larger                 percentages of at risk individuals more cost-effectively. Preliminary research       on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to weight management          suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective      multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves        the customization and feasibility testing of a stage-matched, individualized,        interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively          recruiting 60 percent of eligible participants (n=250) to participate in a           randomized clinical trial and evaluating acceptability of the intervention           materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals        delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on        the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis          will provide the theoretical framework that experts have indicated is necessary      to develop more effective and cost-effective interventions.                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed TTM based expert system weight management intervention is capable of  high recruitment rates, accurate assessment, and individualized interventions that have  the ability to create high impact on a population basis.  We envision such interactive  technologies for entire populations delivered at relatively low costs through the mail or  over the Internet or an Intranet.

"Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims of this research project                            are (1) to replicate one of the most effective approaches to behavioral              intervention, a series of expert system interventions, for both smoking              cessation and reduction of dietary fat on a national sample; (2) to extend the       intervention to the reduction of sedentary life style; (3) to develop and            assess the effectiveness of an innovative automated counseling intervention,         the TLC telecommunications system, applied to the same 3 behavioral risk             factors; (4) to compare the effectiveness of the current modular expert system       approach with an integrated expert system intervention, and (5) to determine         the cost-effectiveness of each of the 3 interventions. All subjects will be at       risk for all 3 risk factors and all interventions would intervene on all 3 risk      factors simultaneously. The modular expert system intervention involves 3            assessments, each followed by 3 separate feedback reports at 6-month intervals       for each of the risk factors. The telecommunications system involves briefer         assessments on each risk factor and counseling luring regular telephone              contacts over a 12-month period. The integrated expert system intervention           involves a single assessment on 3 occasions of all 3 risk factors followed by        intervention on all 3 risk factors simultaneously in an attempt to increase          efficiency and capitalize on the covariance between the behaviors. All 3             interventions are based on the Transtheoretical Model. The national sample           would be 1600 subjects recruited throughout the continental United States using      random digit dial telephone methodology. All interventions are designed to           impact on a total population and a proactive recruitment procedure will be           employed to recruit more than 75 percent of the eligible sample.

"Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims of this research project                            are (1) to replicate one of the most effective approaches to behavioral              intervention, a series of expert system interventions, for both smoking              cessation and reduction of dietary fat on a national sample; (2) to extend the       intervention to the reduction of sedentary life style; (3) to develop and            assess the effectiveness of an innovative automated counseling intervention,         the TLC telecommunications system, applied to the same 3 behavioral risk             factors; (4) to compare the effectiveness of the current modular expert system       approach with an integrated expert system intervention, and (5) to determine         the cost-effectiveness of each of the 3 interventions. All subjects will be at       risk for all 3 risk factors and all interventions would intervene on all 3 risk      factors simultaneously. The modular expert system intervention involves 3            assessments, each followed by 3 separate feedback reports at 6-month intervals       for each of the risk factors. The telecommunications system involves briefer         assessments on each risk factor and counseling luring regular telephone              contacts over a 12-month period. The integrated expert system intervention           involves a single assessment on 3 occasions of all 3 risk factors followed by        intervention on all 3 risk factors simultaneously in an attempt to increase          efficiency and capitalize on the covariance between the behaviors. All 3             interventions are based on the Transtheoretical Model. The national sample           would be 1600 subjects recruited throughout the continental United States using      random digit dial telephone methodology. All interventions are designed to           impact on a total population and a proactive recruitment procedure will be           employed to recruit more than 75 percent of the eligible sample.

"Just in Time Information for Exercise Adoption DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     A novel personal digital assistant (PDA)-based system that can automatically detect bouts of moderate or greater walking and deliver health behavior change information to users to increase their levels of physical activity will be developed and evaluated. The system will be an extension of work already performed by the investigators, and will incorporate a validated wireless motion sensor, pattern classification software to identify bouts of walking, and a personified, relational user interface designed to maintain engagement and trust in the tailored behavior change information delivered to users over multiple interactions. The system will be designed to be worn and used continuously by free-living populations and provide users with health behavior change information at the moment it is needed.      Users will interact with the PDA via a simulated face-to-face conversation with the animated relational agent, and will conduct a daily progress review and goal-setting session at which time they will schedule specific times they intend to walk on the following day (bouts of 10 minutes or more of moderate or greater intensity). If they complete a scheduled walk, the agent provides immediate social reinforcement. If they fail to initiate a walk at a scheduled time the agent engages them in a problem-solving session in which it attempts to help them overcome the specific obstacle to exercise they are experiencing.       In the proposed effort the components of the PDA-based system will be developed, integrated and tested, and a randomized pilot study conducted to: 1) evaluate the efficacy of the PDA-based behavior change intervention for increasing walking; 2) evaluate the effect of timeliness of health behavior change information on walking (time of need vs. retrospective); and 3) compare the efficacy of the personified user interface with that of a text-based interface for delivering health behavior change information on a PDA.      The proposed work will make significant contributions to several areas within the science of medical informatics, extending and integrating work in knowledge representation, bio-signal analysis, natural language processing, and consumer health informatics. This research will advance our understanding of the role of time in health behavior change, and result in a model of the temporal relationships among sensor data, user behavior, user goals, and the delivery of health information intended to change behavior. n/a",Just in Time Information for Exercise Adoption,7127056,R21LM008553,[' '],NLM,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2005,105924,-0.02535305930057046

"Rett syndrome: determinants of outcome and burden DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This population-based study will follow the current cohort of live (n=225) cases with Rett syndrome in Australia for a further five years. New cases ascertained during the study period will also be included. It will describe the natural history of Rett syndrome and assess its impact on resource utilization and the economic and social burden on families and community in comparison with Down syndrome and a normal comparison group. Baseline data on communication, mobility, symptoms and classification have been gathered on the cohort since 1993. In 2000 data were collected on functional ability in daily living, behavior, hand function, medical conditions, and use of health and education services. Mutation data, collected on 80 percent of cases will be continued. A questionnaire has been developed, piloted and will be used to collect data on function, health and well-being of the Rett syndrome subjects and family in 2002, 2004 and 2006. Data will be gathered for the Down syndrome comparison group in 2003. Participants will respond via paper-based or through secure on-line formats. Optical scanning or on-line data capture will be used for data entry. In 2003 and 2005 clinical assessments or clinical file review will provide EEG, ECG, blood parameters, bone densitometry and autonomic nervous system data. A video protocol developed in 2001 to record functional ability will be extended to include gross motor and oral motor function, hand apraxia, gait assessment and language function. Serial videos collected in 2003 and again in 2005 will enable us to monitor changes over time and the effect of therapy or surgery. Yearly telephone interviews to families will record anthropometric data, current medication usage and update previously collected family tree data. Every two years a validated questionnaire to identify epilepsy type will be included. Resource data to determine the direct, indirect and opportunity costs associated with Rett syndrome will be compared with a normal and Down syndrome comparison group. Data analysis will use multiple regression models to examine effects of different variables on child and family level outcomes and discriminant analysis, recursive partitioning and machine learning to identify genotype/phenotype associations at the individual child level.

"Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management   DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity        has increased dramatically over the last two decades. Overweight and obesity,        the second leading preventable cause of death, poses a major public health           challenge in that it increases the risk of chronic diseases, including coronary      heart disease, and all-cause mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight             management are costly and serve only a small percentage of individuals.              Population-based behavior change programs are needed to reach larger                 percentages of at risk individuals more cost-effectively. Preliminary research       on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to weight management          suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective      multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves        the customization and feasibility testing of a stage-matched, individualized,        interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively          recruiting 60 percent of eligible participants (n=250) to participate in a           randomized clinical trial and evaluating acceptability of the intervention           materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals        delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on        the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis          will provide the theoretical framework that experts have indicated is necessary      to develop more effective and cost-effective interventions.                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed TTM based expert system weight management intervention is capable of  high recruitment rates, accurate assessment, and individualized interventions that have  the ability to create high impact on a population basis.  We envision such interactive  technologies for entire populations delivered at relatively low costs through the mail or  over the Internet or an Intranet.  Commercial applications include marketing to healthcare  providers, namely managed care organizations, and employers who share the burden of  healthcare expenses.  n/a",Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management,6734209,R44HL070549,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior therapy', 'clinical trials', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'dietary lipid', 'health education', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'interactive multimedia', 'nutrient intake activity', 'patient oriented research', 'weight control', 'weight loss']",NHLBI,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2004,315359,0.0017258303710350027

"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are, they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms   2) Accommodative Mechanisms   3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms   There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term, we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause. In phase 1, we propose to:   Clinically define CVS by observing the incidence of ocular surface abnormalities in symptomatic subjects and compare them with an age and sex matched non-symptomatic control population   Develop specialized micro-environment glasses to combat CVS symptoms   Study the efficacy of micro-environment glasses in symptomatic and control populations   Critically evaluate viability of CVS micro-environment glasses as a commercial product      using both statistical methods and subjective questionnaires.            n/a",Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS,6792878,R41EY015023,"['age difference', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computers', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'gender difference', 'human subject', 'keratoconjunctivitis sicca', 'occupational health /safety', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'questionnaires', 'syndrome', 'vision aid', 'vision disorders', 'visual photosensitivity', 'work site']",NEI,"SEEFIT, INC.",R41,2004,100000,-0.035361710417126026

"Spinal Cord Injury: Automatic Scoring of Motor Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disorders of motor function due to accidental injury, stroke and neurodegenerative disorders, together with disorders of mental health, are the most crippling human ailments. One common result of mechanical insult is spinal cord injury (SCI), in which damage of the spinal cord by contusion, compression or laceration causes loss of sensation, motor and reflex function below the point of injury. Other symptoms of SCI may include bowel and bladder dysfunction, hyperalgesia and sexual dysfunction. Although many SCI patients survive injury, major chronic dysfunction is the most common outcome. There are approximately 10,000 new cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) in the U.S each year. In contrast to the relatively small acute patient population, chronic SCI, involving approximately 200,000-250,000 people in this country, is extremely expensive to society, both in terms of human and economic costs. Because most SCI victims are under age 30 at the time of their injury, and most now live a near-normal life span, direct medical costs average $2 million per patient over a lifetime, and approximately $5 billion total per year in the US only. Therefore, any   drug or intervention that can positively improve the quality of life of patients suffering from SCI is likely to have a greater financial impact than would be expected simply from the cost of acute injury each year.  Animal models for SCI and other conditions that affect gait and motor coordination are successfully used today to develop new treatments. Assessing the level of motor dysfunction in an animal model is a difficult challenge as most researchers rely on the subjective scoring of symptoms. We propose here to build a system that will allow a more objective, faster and consistent assessment of the level of injury and course of recovery in rat and mouse models of SCI that can be applied in the future to other gait and motor coordination disorders. An artificial intelligent system based on computer vision will be developed to capture and score gait and motor coordination in rodents and will be validated against the standard scores of motor function obtained using the methods of Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (1995) for the rat model of SCI.         n/a",Spinal Cord Injury: Automatic Scoring of Motor Function,6695163,R43NS046980,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' gait', ' laboratory rat', ' limb movement', ' psychomotor function', ' spinal cord injury']",NINDS,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2003,234554,-0.02528454800966816

Population-based behavior change programs are needed to reach larger                 percentages of at risk individuals more cost-effectively. Preliminary research       on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to weight management          suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective      multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves        the customization and feasibility testing of a stage-matched, individualized,        interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively          recruiting 60 percent of eligible participants (n=250) to participate in a           randomized clinical trial and evaluating acceptability of the intervention           materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals        delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on        the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis          will provide the theoretical framework that experts have indicated is necessary      to develop more effective and cost-effective interventions.                          PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The proposed TTM based expert system weight management intervention is capable of  high recruitment rates, accurate assessment, and individualized interventions that have  the ability to create high impact on a population basis.  We envision such interactive  technologies for entire populations delivered at relatively low costs through the mail or  over the Internet or an Intranet.  Commercial applications include marketing to healthcare  providers, namely managed care organizations, and employers who share the burden of  healthcare expenses.  n/a",Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management,6651486,R44HL070549,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior therapy', ' clinical trials', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' dietary lipid', ' health education', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' interactive multimedia', ' nutrient intake activity', ' patient oriented research', ' weight control', ' weight loss']",NHLBI,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2003,479254,0.0017258303710350027
"Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims of this research project                            are (1) to replicate one of the most effective approaches to behavioral              intervention, a series of expert system interventions, for both smoking              cessation and reduction of dietary fat on a national sample; (2) to extend the       intervention to the reduction of sedentary life style; (3) to develop and            assess the effectiveness of an innovative automated counseling intervention,         the TLC telecommunications system, applied to the same 3 behavioral risk             factors; (4) to compare the effectiveness of the current modular expert system       approach with an integrated expert system intervention, and (5) to determine         the cost-effectiveness of each of the 3 interventions. All subjects will be at       risk for all 3 risk factors and all interventions would intervene on all 3 risk      factors simultaneously. The modular expert system intervention involves 3            assessments, each followed by 3 separate feedback reports at 6-month intervals       for each of the risk factors. The telecommunications system involves briefer         assessments on each risk factor and counseling luring regular telephone              contacts over a 12-month period. The integrated expert system intervention           involves a single assessment on 3 occasions of all 3 risk factors followed by        intervention on all 3 risk factors simultaneously in an attempt to increase          efficiency and capitalize on the covariance between the behaviors. All 3             interventions are based on the Transtheoretical Model. The national sample           would be 1600 subjects recruited throughout the continental United States using      random digit dial telephone methodology. All interventions are designed to           impact on a total population and a proactive recruitment procedure will be           employed to recruit more than 75 percent of the eligible sample. The design is       a 4-group (Control, Modular Expert System intervention, Telecommunications           Intervention, Integrated Expert System Intervention) x 3 occasions (0, 12, and       24 months). Each behavioral risk factor will be intervened upon for 12 months        and the 3 risk factors will be related simultaneously.

"Predicting life-threatening events in CHIME infant data  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant under one year old without any apparent warning signs.  It is the leading cause of death of infants between the age of one month and one year in the developed countries. Previous studies have indicated that SIDS victims may suffer from cardiorespiratory failure, which reflects immaturity of autonomic nervous system (ANS) control. Heart variability (HRV) has been shown to be a noninvasive and inexpensive way to assess the ANS. Increased heart rate and decreased heart rate variability have been observed in SIDS victims. While it is unclear whether there is a relationship between SIDS and infants who have apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) like apnea and bradycardia, there is a desire to gain a better understanding of the nature of ALTE, their frequency and severity, and the ability of home monitors to detect events and provide an alarm. The Collaborative Home Infant Monitoring Evaluation (CHIME) study group, formed by NIH, sought to study these issues through the collection of a massive clinical database, which includes physiological, signals from 529 infants recorded in polysomnographic (PSG) studies. The infants were then studied several months using a home monitor which recorded life-threatening events. A classification is available regarding which infants had verified, apparent life-threatening events. Given the wealth of information linking SIDS and heart rate variability (HRV), we desire to investigate whether heart rate variability is effective predictor for life-threatening events. This research will investigate whether HRV can differentiate infants at risk for future apparent life-threatening events (FALTE). First statistical methods will be used to determine if there is significant difference in HRV between normal and FALTE infant groups. Next, the major goal is to design a method to classify infants using HRV, exploring various prediction models including logistic regression, decision tree, and neural networks. The relationship between HRV parameters and all the affected factors will also be studied to provide a clearer understanding of the parameters, and to help determine how to use HRV as a classifier. Successful prediction of infants with future apparent life-threatening events could have clinical significance and provide physicians with an opportunity for treatment.   n/a",Predicting life-threatening events in CHIME infant data,6619652,R03HD042479,"['apnea', ' autonomic nervous system', ' bradycardia', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' heart rate', ' human data', ' infant human (0-1 year)', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' patient monitoring device', ' polysomnography', ' statistics /biometry', ' sudden infant death syndrome']",NICHD,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R03,2003,78500,-0.02398613392504849
"Rett syndrome: determinants of outcome and burden DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This population-based study will follow the current cohort of live (n=225) cases with Rett syndrome in Australia for a further five years. New cases ascertained during the study period will also be included. It will describe the natural history of Rett syndrome and assess its impact on resource utilization and the economic and social burden on families and community in comparison with Down syndrome and a normal comparison group. Baseline data on communication, mobility, symptoms and classification have been gathered on the cohort since 1993. In 2000 data were collected on functional ability in daily living, behavior, hand function, medical conditions, and use of health and education services. Mutation data, collected on 80 percent of cases will be continued. A questionnaire has been developed, piloted and will be used to collect data on function, health and well-being of the Rett syndrome subjects and family in 2002, 2004 and 2006. Data will be gathered for the Down syndrome comparison group in 2003. Participants will respond via paper-based or through secure on-line formats. Optical scanning or on-line data capture will be used for data entry. In 2003 and 2005 clinical assessments or clinical file review will provide EEG, ECG, blood parameters, bone densitometry and autonomic nervous system data. A video protocol developed in 2001 to record functional ability will be extended to include gross motor and oral motor function, hand apraxia, gait assessment and language function. Serial videos collected in 2003 and again in 2005 will enable us to monitor changes over time and the effect of therapy or surgery. Yearly telephone interviews to families will record anthropometric data, current medication usage and update previously collected family tree data. Every two years a validated questionnaire to identify epilepsy type will be included. Resource data to determine the direct, indirect and opportunity costs associated with Rett syndrome will be compared with a normal and Down syndrome comparison group. Data analysis will use multiple regression models to examine effects of different variables on child and family level outcomes and discriminant analysis, recursive partitioning and machine learning to identify genotype/phenotype associations at the individual child level. Feedback to families on study progress will be given through the study Web site. n/a",Rett syndrome: determinants of outcome and burden,6678177,R01HD043100,"['Australia', ' Downs syndrome', ' Internet', ' Rett syndrome', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral medicine', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder etiology', ' epilepsy', ' family genetics', ' family structure /dynamics', ' functional ability', ' genotype', ' health care', ' health care cost /financing', ' human mortality', ' human subject', ' interview', ' longitudinal human study', ' mathematical model', ' outcomes research', ' psychomotor function', ' quality of life', ' scoliosis', ' social support network', ' statistics /biometry']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA,R01,2003,170100,-0.002525191385480096
"Narrow-Band Active Noise Reduction for DPOAE Measurement DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to enable accurate acquisition of distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) measurements in relatively high noise environments for use in hearing evaluations and screening. DPOAE measurements have been shown to be an effective and efficient method for screening infant, children, and adult hearing. Environmental noise, however, has been shown to adversely affect the ability to successfully obtain DPOAE measurements, especially at frequencies below 1500 Hz.  We will achieve our aim by developing a narrow-band, adaptive active noise reduction system that will seamlessly augment existing DPOAE measurement protocols. Our innovation will supplement existing DPOAE measurement systems with both low-cost acoustic hardware and advanced signal processing techniques. By reducing background noise levels in a narrow frequency band near the DPOAE test frequencies, we will enable higher signal-to-noise ratio DPOAE measurement sequences. The increased SNR will result in the ability to obtain DPOAE measurements in relatively high noise environments such as the newborn intensive care unit and nursery, offices of pediatricians, schools without special audiology facilities, field hospitals, and remote or mobile clinics. n/a",Narrow-Band Active Noise Reduction for DPOAE Measurement,6485483,R43DC005112,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' computer program /software', ' hearing tests', ' human subject', ' measurement', ' noise', ' otoacoustic emission', ' sound frequency']",NIDCD,"CREARE, INC.",R43,2002,103954,-0.01594718295530346

"STRESS MANAGEMENT EXPERT SYSTEM FOR CANCER PREVENTION Stage matched interventions for stress management that are interactive and individualized, and are delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts. Computer based expert systems linked to self-help manuals can be as effective as Counselors but at much lower cost and greater accessibility. Stress is an important cause of cancer and other chronic and acute diseases and is one of the most costly behaviors in terms of health care, job performance and disability. Fifty million Americans do not practice effective stress management. Existing programs are action- oriented and are designed for the 30% of populations who are prepared to take action. Stage matched programs can meet the needs of all; the 45% in the Precontemplation stage and the 25% in the Contemplation stage. Phase I of this Fast-Track research will demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting 70% of at-risk populations and the acceptability of the expert system interventions. Phase II will complete recruitment of 1200 participants randomly assigned to treatment or control and can demonstrate efficacy of these interventions over six months. Follow-up over 18 months can show increasing impact long after the intervention.

"ACTUARIAL STRATEGIES IN CHILD DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT  The proposed project involves a preliminary investigation of                                                                                   potentially significant methodological advance in diagnostic assessment. The         current state-of-the-art in diagnostic assessment involves the use of a              structured interview. Typically, structured interviews involve a static skip         structure, i.e., some portions of the interview are administered conditional on                                 particular responses to prior questions. For example, if there is a negative         response to a question about depression and anhedonia, most structured               interviews require the clinical to skip the remaining questions about                associated symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, etc.).         Although structured interviews represent an enormous advantage over earlier          diagnostic procedures, their inflexible structure is often incompatible with         the heterogeneity of most child and adolescent populations, and can result in        superfluous questioning about uncommon disorders and insufficient follow-up          about more common ones. Many interviews do not make exceptions for individual        characteristics. For example, 1) a 17 year old boy might need to answer ""no"" to      5 or 6 questions about separation anxiety before the interviewer may move on to      another set of questions; or 2) an underweight 16 year old girl might not be         asked important follow-up questions when replying ""no"" to the initial question       about eating disorders. One might conclude that introducing more clinician           flexibility would be the solution; however, the literature on clinical judgment      suggests that increasing clinician involvement in determination of interview         structure would likely degrade classification accuracy and introduce unwanted        sources of error and bias. To address this issue in another manner, the              principal investigator has developed a data-driven, actuarial expert system to       guide a flexible interview structure. Thus, interview structure is dynamically       responsive to individual characteristics, without introducing error associated       with qualitative clinical judgments. Pilot modeling revealed that his system         offers advantages in classification accuracy over state-of-the-art diagnostic        approaches, with the additional benefit of reducing administration time for          particular disorders. The current project is planned to generate requisite data      to develop a formal expert system and to forecast its relative accuracy and          efficiency in a child and adolescent population. It is predicted that this           system will demonstrate improvements in classification accuracy over a static        structured interview approach, with reduced administration time.

"PERCEPTION OF RISK AND BEHAVIOR IN THE ELDERLY   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): This application was            initially submitted as an R29 FIRST Award, and is being re-submitted as an R01       in response to Program Announcement, PA-97-065 (NIA) entitled, ""Social               Cognition and Aging.""                                                                 The goal of this project is to determine how individual risk perceptions             influence health behaviors among the near-elderly (51-61) and decisions              regarding wealth holdings among the elderly (70+). Among the near-elderly, the       following health behaviors will be studied: the use of preventive services           (mammography, prostate screening, and cholesterol screening), weight loss and        exercise. The preventive services are designed to reduce mortality from cancer       and heart disease. Weight loss and exercise are both preventive measures as          well as mitigators of harm that results from health shocks. Expanding the use        of these preventive and mitigating measures are important to reduce morbidity        and mortality from heart disease and cancer. Among the elderly, the behavior of      interest relates to asset accumulation/dissaving, specifically focusing on           housing decisions. The specific decisions will be selling a house, and changes       in housing wealth holdings. The two decisions will be analyzed because housing       assets likely have fewer measurement errors, and because housing is the major        component of wealth for most elderly persons. Housing decisions are important        from a policy perspective because they may represent precautionary savings to        finance long-term care, a substantial risk the elderly face.                                                                                                              The proposed conceptual model is an extension of the common Bayesian learning        model whereby prior risk perceptions are updated on the basis of information.        Our model holds that updated risk perceptions, in turn, influence behavior.          Risk perceptions will be estimated as enodogenous explanatory variables              simultaneously with health behaviors among the near-elderly and housing              decisions among the elderly.

"STRESS MANAGEMENT EXPERT SYSTEM FOR CANCER PREVENTION DESCRIPTION:  Stage matched interventions for stress management that are interactive and individualized, and are delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts.  Computer based expert systems linked to self-help manuals can be as effective as counselors but at much lower cost and greater accessibility.  Stress is an important cause of cancer and other chronic and acute diseases and is one of the most costly behaviors in terms of health care, job performance and disability.  Fifty million Americans do not practice effective stress management.  Existing programs are action-oriented and are designed for the 30% of populations who are prepared to take action.  Stage matched programs can meet the needs of all; the 45% in the Pre-contemplation stage and the 25% in the Contemplation stage.  Phase I of this Fast-Track research will demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting 70% of at-risk populations and the acceptability of the expert system interventions.  Phase II will complete recruitment of 1200 participants randomly assigned to treatment or control and can demonstrate efficacy of these interventions over six months.  Follow-up over 18 months can show increasing impact long after the intervention.  Effective and cost-effective stress management systems can be broadly disseminated with consistent quality and user friendly acceptability.  n/a",STRESS MANAGEMENT EXPERT SYSTEM FOR CANCER PREVENTION,6211051,R44CA081948,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer prevention', ' clinical research', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' education evaluation /planning', ' health education', ' human subject', ' interactive multimedia', ' publications', ' questionnaires', ' self help', ' statistics /biometry', ' stress management']",NCI,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2000,371291,-0.003119780526537516
"WEIGHT MANAGEMENT EXPERT SYSTEMS FOR DIABETES Approximately 90% of individuals with NIDDM are overweight. Overweight can exacerbate the course of the disease and co-morbid conditions, increasing health care utilization, morbidity, and mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight management are costly and serve only a small percentage of at risk individuals. Thus, population-based behavior change programs may be necessary to reach larger percentages of at risk individuals more cost- effectively. Preliminary research on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to health behaviors involved in weight management suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves the customization and feasibility test of a stage-matched, individualized, interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively recruiting 50% of eligible participants (n=300) to participate in a randomized clinical trial of a comprehensive weight management expert system intervention and evaluating acceptability of the intervention materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis will provide the theoretical and individualized framework that experts in the area have indicated is necessary to develop more effective and cost- effective interventions. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Overweight and obesity are costly to all participants in the health care delivery system. Over 90% of the 15 million adults with NIDDM are overweight, which increases healthcare utilization, morbidity, and mortality. Effective population-based weight management interventions that are appropriate for people at all stages of change have the potential to have significant health and financial impacts, as well as tremendous commercial potential.  n/a",WEIGHT MANAGEMENT EXPERT SYSTEMS FOR DIABETES,6141688,R43DK057921,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior therapy', ' body weight', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diet', ' dietary carbohydrates', ' dietary lipid', ' exercise', ' health behavior', ' human subject', ' noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus', ' nutrition related tag', ' weight control']",NIDDK,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2000,114434,-0.007079702773154656
"ACTUARIAL STRATEGIES IN CHILD DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT  The proposed project involves a preliminary investigation of                                                                                   potentially significant methodological advance in diagnostic assessment. The         current state-of-the-art in diagnostic assessment involves the use of a              structured interview. Typically, structured interviews involve a static skip         structure, i.e., some portions of the interview are administered conditional on                                 particular responses to prior questions. For example, if there is a negative         response to a question about depression and anhedonia, most structured               interviews require the clinical to skip the remaining questions about                associated symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, etc.).         Although structured interviews represent an enormous advantage over earlier          diagnostic procedures, their inflexible structure is often incompatible with         the heterogeneity of most child and adolescent populations, and can result in        superfluous questioning about uncommon disorders and insufficient follow-up          about more common ones. Many interviews do not make exceptions for individual        characteristics. For example, 1) a 17 year old boy might need to answer ""no"" to      5 or 6 questions about separation anxiety before the interviewer may move on to      another set of questions; or 2) an underweight 16 year old girl might not be         asked important follow-up questions when replying ""no"" to the initial question       about eating disorders. One might conclude that introducing more clinician           flexibility would be the solution; however, the literature on clinical judgment      suggests that increasing clinician involvement in determination of interview         structure would likely degrade classification accuracy and introduce unwanted        sources of error and bias. To address this issue in another manner, the              principal investigator has developed a data-driven, actuarial expert system to       guide a flexible interview structure. Thus, interview structure is dynamically       responsive to individual characteristics, without introducing error associated       with qualitative clinical judgments. Pilot modeling revealed that his system         offers advantages in classification accuracy over state-of-the-art diagnostic        approaches, with the additional benefit of reducing administration time for          particular disorders. The current project is planned to generate requisite data      to develop a formal expert system and to forecast its relative accuracy and          efficiency in a child and adolescent population.

"INTERACTIVE MEDIA FOR WOMEN CONSIDERING HORMONE THERAPY The long-term goal of Phase I and Phase II is to create a series of bilingual (Spanish/English), bicultural, interactive CD-ROMs dealing with issues related to menopause and aging, with specific emphasis on Hispanic women. This proposal will result in a CD-ROM about Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) that takes 15-3O minutes to use and will test its value in a controlled study. Through an interactive decision-tree that specifies individual risk factors and lifestyle preferences, the CD-ROM will help users identify their options, including HRT, lifestyle changes such as exercise and diet, and other alternatives. Besides providing information, the CD-ROM will be designed to improve decision-making and increase women's confidence in their ability to make informed choices. Although it may increase the risk of cancer, HRT relieves short-term menopausal symptoms, and appears to offer long-term benefits of reduced risk for heart disease, stroke and osteoporosis. Over 40 million women will pass through menopause in the next two decades. Studies have shown that Hispanic women are less familiar with HRT and less likely to use it than non-Hispanic white women. In addition, Hispanas approach medical care with their own set of cultural values. Interactive media offer personalization, enhanced learning through multiple sensory input, and a cost-effective method of providing information in a managed care environment or busy individual practice. This is an innovative application of existing technology to provide patient education. Possible topics for Phase II include osteoporosis, heart disease, depression, and stroke. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Educational media is a $3B market. Print and video materials on HRT and menopause are available, but little exists as interactive media, in Spanish, and/or is culturally-relevant to Hispanics.

"AI2AMP-PD: Accelerating Parkinsons Diagnosis using Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence AI2AMP-PD: Accelerating Parkinson’s Diagnosis using Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects more than 7 million people worldwide, and biomarkers to bolster the therapeutic pipeline are urgently needed. Developing biomarkers for clinical use is a difficult process that requires evaluation of multiple, large cohorts, each adding confidence to the marker. The Accelerating Medicine Partnership in Parkinson’s disease (AMP PD) consortium provides an unparalleled opportunity to rapidly achieve this previously elusive goal.  We hypothesize that a powerful, multi-omics classifier powered by standard and advanced machine learning algorithms will accurately identify PD-associated biomarkers at genome scale. Transcripts and genomic classifiers associated with PD will be identified in early-stage, untreated, patients with Dopamine Transporter- neuroimaging-supported diagnosis represented in the PPMI cohort. Transcripts and genomic classifiers will be rigorously replicated in the independent PDBP and BioFIND cohorts. Multi-omics classifiers using both PD- associated transcriptome changes and PD-associated genomic variants will be built with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques (e.g. variational autoencoder).  This analysis will powerfully delineate --- for the first time --- the full spectrum of known and novel, coding and noncoding RNAs linked to PD and detectable in circulating blood cells in a harmonized, large-scale data set. It will develop and test highly innovative multi-omics classifiers and provide a generally useful computational framework for large-scale, unbiased PD biomarker discovery. Project Narrative These large-scale studies are relevant to public health for two reasons. First, they will reveal the biomarker genes whose dysregulation of expression level is associated with (and possibly causal of) early development of Parkinson’s disease. Secondly, the multi-omics, DNA-RNA predictive model built here based on large dataset and advanced deep learning methods will provide a computational framework for further biomarker development and early disease prediction.",AI2AMP-PD: Accelerating Parkinsons Diagnosis using Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence,10157680,U01NS120637,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'DNA', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'dopamine transporter', 'feature selection', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic signature', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2020,537000,-0.02457438843875457
"Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health PROJECT SUMMARY Over 80% of the US population resides in urban areas, and the built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may drive cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain, and by influencing exposures to environmental factors, such as air pollution, extreme temperatures, and noise. Evidence for the built environment and CVD has been dominated by cross-sectional studies with nonspecific exposure assessment. Developing precise, time-varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to establish causal relationships between the built environment and CVD, which are crucial to informing policy-relevant, actionable interventions. It is now possible to estimate such exposure metrics at scale in prospective cohort studies using deep learning computer vision methods, a class of machine learning algorithms that can accurately process images, combined with time-varying nationwide street-level imagery, high resolution satellite data, and novel mobile health technologies. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing built environment exposure measures from deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data in participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (N=500), and to geocoded residential addresses from nationwide Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts (N=288,000). We will create built environment exposure measures by leveraging deep learning algorithms applied to nationwide Google Street View imagery (2007-2020) and high-resolution Landsat satellite data (1986-2020) to create fine-scale, time-varying built environment metrics of the natural environment (e.g., trees), physical environment (e.g., sidewalks), perceptions (e.g., safety), and urban form (e.g., compact high-rise). We will use a mix of innovative analytical approaches to determine the effect of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence across different time horizons. First, we will append these metrics to time-activity patterns of participants who have collected minute-level data on GPS and physical activity from smartphones and consumer wearable devices to quantify how minute-level exposure to the built environment is related to CVD health behaviors. Next, we will apply novel built environment metrics to residential address histories of participants to estimate how self-reported CVD health behaviors change after their residential built environment changes. Last, we will examine the association between long-term cumulative residential exposure to the built environment and CVD incidence over 34 years of follow-up. Our work will enable us to measure built environment exposure from unprecedented perspectives in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential causal relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, and to better specify pathways to CVD incidence. Ultimately, our work will yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health. PROJECT NARRATIVE The built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain and by shaping exposures to environmental hazards (e.g., air pollution, extreme temperatures, noise); however, developing accurate, time- varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to build causal relationships between the built environment and CVD and to inform policy-relevant, actionable interventions. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing longitudinal built environment exposure measures from street-view and satellite imagery using deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data from a) 500 participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (NHS3) and b) over 34 years of geocoded residential addresses from three large nationwide cohorts of over 288,000 US adult women and men from the Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts.

"Machine learning for analysis of walking patterns and physical activity in knee osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) exhibit altered walking patterns that cause repetitive, abnormal forces on the knee joint, leading to disease progression. Existing interventions to reduce knee loading during walking have not resulted in meaningful change in knee OA symptoms or joint structure. A key limitation of existing research has been the use of simplified metrics to describe walking patterns and not accounting for walking amount and intensity (i.e. physical activity). The goal of this research is to comprehensively characterize walking patterns and activity in people with and without knee OA and to assess the associations of walking with 2-year change in knee OA outcomes. Machine learning approaches will be used to analyze ground reaction force (GRF) data and accelerometer-derived physical activity metrics in an existing, large, well- characterized cohort (n=2575) from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST). Machine learning approaches that use selected features and those that are agnostic and utilize all available information from time-varying GRFs will be used in combination with physical activity metrics to classify symptomatic and structural change. The results from machine learning approaches will be compared to those of common statistical approaches. This research will allow for characterization of the complex relationships between walking patterns and activity, providing novel insights into OA disease processes.

"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,9981021,K99MH118359,"['10 year old', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'artificial neural network', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neural correlate', 'periadolescent', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social factors', 'symptom cluster']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,156897,0.0018982019621397164
"Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the leading cause of global disease burden. Associated with over 1,000 different symptom profiles, MDD is highly heterogeneous. The majority of MDD symptom change occurs across hours. Consequently, there is a need to increasingly focus MDD research on personalized assessment of these rapid symptom fluctuations. To date, personalized models of MDD have shown promise, but relied solely on self-report measures. There is thus a critical need to develop personalized models of MDD that incorporate objective signals. Passively collected information from smartphones and wearable sensors can continuously and unobtrusively track behavioral and physiological signals related to core disturbances associated with MDD, including psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbances, social contact, behavioral activation, heart rate variability, and screen time. Preliminary data suggest that personalized artificial intelligence (i.e., personally weighted deep learning models) are well suited for creating novel personalized digital biomarkers of these passive indicators, and that these biomarkers can predict rapid changes in MDD symptoms. This proposal will investigate the ability to develop personalized deep learning models of rapid changes in MDD symptoms among a nationally representative sample of 120 treatment seeking adults with MDD across 90 days using passively collected data from smartphones and wearable sensors. This proposal aims to test the accuracy of personalized, subtyped, and cohort-based modeling techniques and uncover personalized digital biomarkers of moment-to-moment changes in MDD symptoms. The project proposes the following innovations: it will (1) conduct the first passive-sensing study of MDD in a nationally-representative cohort; (2) utilize deep learning models to aid in the discovery of novel maintenance factors of MDD symptom changes; and (3) use personalized multimodal assessments of MDD to address the heterogeneity in MDD. In line with the aims of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this project will study MDD symptom changes across multiple units of analysis and integrate multiple systems. This study will provide a critical step towards uncovering novel personalized maintenance patterns of MDD symptom changes in daily life. Further, it will allow for scalable personalized treatments to be developed using technology to deliver behavioral interventions in the moments immediately preceding rapid MDD symptom changes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to utilize personalized artificial intelligence techniques and objective data (collected from smartphones and wearable devices) to create individualized digital biomarkers of rapid changes in major depressive disorder symptoms. This is important because, if we were to uncover personalized patterns between objectively measured physiology and behavioral changes and understand their resulting impact on rapid fluctuations in major depressive disorder symptoms, we would be able to define new, person-specific maintenance patterns that underlie the wide-ranging heterogeneity that is currently seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Moreover, these advancements will provide a crucial step forward towards developing personalized, scalable, technology-based interventions that will be able to be delivered immediately (and, ideally, before rapid symptom changes) among those persons with major depressive disorder.",Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices,10029386,R01MH123482,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Devices', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analog', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'microphone', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenomenological models', 'premature', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tv watching', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,250435,-0.021501905449459218
"Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 30,000 new HPV-related-cancers are diagnosed annually. Although HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2006 and recommended for routine vaccination for school-age girls and boys, vaccination rates remain low. One reason that has contributed to low vaccination rates is incorrect “risk perceptions” around HPV vaccines such as the high perceived risks of adverse events or side effects from the HPV vaccine. Incorrect risk perceptions are often rooted in the false information about HPV vaccines that people are exposed to in their daily life, including social media. The impact of social media on health information is substantial. Negative social-media HPV-vaccine information has been found to have an association with low vaccination coverage. Given the negative consequences of false information, there is a need to develop a robust and scalable way to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it propagates and negatively impacts behavior. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to build a model to identify false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter, demonstrate its impact on individual risk perceptions and measure its underlying mechanisms on risk perception formation. We propose a novel approach to leverage machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, crowdsourcing/expert data annotation, psycholinguistic analysis and statistical modeling to investigate the false HPV-vaccine information collectively (in terms of its detection and propagation patterns) and individually (in terms of its impact and underlying cognitive mechanisms). Our study will first build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter. By modeling the domain-specific HPV- vaccine related text content, information-veracity related linguistic features, individual and collective user behaviors, and dissemination patterns, our model will be able to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it gets verified and spreads widely. We will then investigate the impact of false HPV-vaccine information on risk perceptions around HPV vaccination operationalized by natural language processing methods and a developed HPV-vaccine Risk Lexicon. We will further conduct psycholinguistic analysis on the false HPV-vaccine information and use statistical modeling to uncover the underlying mechanism of risk perceptions. Our study will make a critical and timely contribution to identifying the false HPV-vaccine information and its impact, which has the potential to be applied to other health topics. This proposed project will also address the National Cancer Institute priorities in promoting HPV vaccines and combating misinformation in cancer prevention and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in part because of incorrect perceptions of vaccination risks, which has been linked to the spread of false HPV-vaccine information. The proposed study seeks to build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on social media (Twitter) and determine its impact on risk perceptions of the HPV vaccine. The findings will provide important contributions to understand the impact of false health information on HPV vaccination behavior and could be expanded to other health topics.",Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions,9954963,R21CA237483,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Individual', 'Information Dissemination', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Politics', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'School-Age Population', 'Semantics', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Text', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'boys', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer prevention', 'combat', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'girls', 'high risk', 'information model', 'information processing', 'multilevel analysis', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'risk perception', 'side effect', 'social media', 'theories', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,211659,-0.043612404543827026
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9852419,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,711592,-0.02359232504234224
"MRI and machine learning to improve early prognosis and clinical management after spinal cord injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Purpose/Hypothesis: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes substantial social, economic, and health burden.1 For individuals with motor incomplete SCI, some basic ability to stand or walk is expected during the recovery process,2 and this is a top priority in rehabilitative programs.3 However, establishing a prognosis for recovering community walking ability is extremely difficult.4 Within 72 hours after SCI,5 edema develops within the damaged spinal cord. This edema is a hallmark of spinal cord injury, expressed as signal hyperintensity using T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Correlations between the sagittal length of this spinal cord edema and walking ability are generally poor.7,8 However, advanced but available high resolution axial T2-weighted MRI to quantify spinal cord edema in people in the acute stage of SCI may improve prediction of walking ability.9,10 The early clinical management and targeted rehabilitation of these individuals could be drastically enhanced, optimizing recovery and rehabilitation outcomes. The main objective of this research project is to use early axial spinal cord MRI sequences as neuroprognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of residual motor function. This objective will be realized by the implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To establish to what extent the axial damage ratio biomarker, measured by high-resolution axial T2-weighted structural imaging, can predict residual function in persons with SCI. Previously-collected axial T2-weighted spinal cord structural MRI data of 200 people with SCI from the US Model SCI System at Craig Hospital will be used to quantify cord damage. This metric will be related to the primary 1-year status-post injury outcome measures, which are clinical records of walking ability and function. Multivariate statistical analyses will be applied to create exploratory models to determine the prognostic value of the MRI measures. We hypothesize that the axial damage ratio can be used in the acute stage as an accurate and objective neuroprognostic biomarker of residual motor function. Aim 2: To identify the relationship between damage to specific spinal cord regions and specific motor and sensory deficits. MRI data from Aim 1 will be used. Spinal cord regional damage analysis will be related to right and left upper and lower extremity motor and sensory scores. Correlational statistical analyses will be applied to analyze relationships between specific tract damage and motor/sensory deficits. We hypothesize that damage to descending lateral corticospinal motor regions is related to ipsilesional motor deficits, and that similar findings exist for ascending sensory regions and sensory deficits. For both Aims, we will compare our manual damage quantification to our machine learning approach to automatically detect spinal cord damage. Aim 3: Develop, test, and distribute a machine-learning based analysis pipeline for spinal cord damage measures. We will use functions included in the Spinal Cord Toolbox and the open-source NiftyNet deep-learning platform to develop the machine-learning based analysis pipeline. The processing steps will include spinal cord detection, spinal cord damage segmentation, registration to the spinal cord template, and the calculation and output of the axial damage ratio and regional damage biomarkers. Significance: Successful completion of these Aims will advance the NIH/NICHD NCMRR aim: “to enhance the health, productivity, independence, and quality of life of people with physical disabilities.” The significance of this outcome relates directly to improving the clinical management of SCI. This research may inform clinicians, patients, and families, regarding the percentage chance of regaining walking ability. The healthcare team will be able to determine, early-on, which people will optimally respond to locomotor training. This work will significantly improve the prognosis for recovery of walking and specific motor/sensory function based on early imaging of the damaged spinal cord. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to use early axial MRI measures of spinal cord damage as objective biomarkers to improve the prediction of walking recovery and specific motor return of individuals following SCI. This research will provide patients with a quantified sense of expectations regarding their chances of walking recovery, and will help guide the healthcare team on the best options for clinical management and rehabilitation (i.e. focusing on neuroplasticity and restoration of walking versus compensatory strategies).

"Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care Project Summary/Abstract The best predictor of future injury is previous injury. Unfortunately, this has not changed in a quarter century, despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and the associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical treatment and/or clinical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Even with formal care, injured athletes are two- to four times (in extreme cases 100 times) more likely to suffer a second injury for up to two years after RTP. This is even more alarming given that 65% of initial sports-related injuries affect children and young adults (ages 5-24 years), setting them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. These data implicate the initial injury event as the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. Thus, an urgent need exists to revolutionize the current standard of post- injury care through better identification and targeting of deficits that underlie second injury risk to enable everyone to stay physically active and healthy for their whole lives. To address this need, we propose a pioneering approach that capitalizes on the biological concept of Phenotypic Plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete’s functional adaptability across different performance environments. Here PP is computed based on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that reflect the functional movement capability of the athlete. The overall objective of this proposal is, therefore, to develop a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach for second injury prevention through the development of a systematic bioinformatics-driven approach for PP profile construction, and the training of genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence to establish treatment type and magnitude for precision enhancement of PP. The result of the proposed work will be a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach via two expected outcomes: (1) a formalized phenotypic precision medicine approach to objectively quantify behavioral plasticity, and (2) the successful implementation of a platform leveraging genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence integrated with mixed reality for performance prediction. This platform will support delivery of personalized treatments for PP enhancement. These objectives are the critical first step for the development of a generalizable precision medicine approach that will revolutionize rehabilitation and finally stem the tide of second injury in sport. This contribution will be significant to push back against the initial injury tipping point and, in doing so, create a pathway for injured athletes to return safely to physical activity and to maintain a long-term healthy lifestyle. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the proposed platform will lead to fewer young men and women who suffer from second injury and the negative effects that lead to poorer long-term health. The project is relevant to NIH’s mission because the knowledge gained will be used to optimize new precision assessment and treatment strategies to prevent injury, and this will enhance health and reduce the burden of athletic injury.",Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care,9989850,R21EB027865,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Services', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral plasticity', 'complex biological systems', 'data fusion', 'environmental change', 'fitness', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'indexing', 'injured', 'injury prevention', 'injury recovery', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'medical specialties', 'mixed reality', 'multimodal data', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult', 'young man', 'young woman']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,312918,-0.01710424815930918
"ClientBot: A conversational agent that supports skills practice and feedback for Motivational Interviewing for AUD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Millions of Americans are in need of evidence-based counseling, such as motivational interviewing (MI), for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) each year. To develop competence in an evidence-based practice like MI, trainees require ample opportunities for practice and immediate, performance-based feedback on the skills that they are learning. However, this is challenging if not impossible to offer at scale -- to the large number of providers in need of training. Opportunities for practice typically rely on roleplays with other trainees with limited experience, and feedback requires either direct supervision from an expert trainer or behavioral coding from a trained coding team; these are costly, limited, and time consuming. AI-based technology can meet this need, generating many opportunities for practice, and providing regular, actionable feedback. Many practice opportunities coupled with rapid, performance-based feedback can enhance and expand training in evidence-based counseling for AUDs in a scalable and cost-efficient manner.  Lyssn.io​, Inc., (“Lyssn”) is a start-up developing AI-based technologies to support training, supervision, and quality assurance of evidence-based counseling. Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient. ​Lyssn’s​ team includes expertise in natural language processing, machine learning, user-centered design, software engineering, and clinical expertise in evidence-based counseling. Previous research demonstrated the basic utility of a prototype conversational agent (ClientBot) for training counselors. Currently, ClientBot simulates a general mental health client who can engage in open-ended interaction with trainees and provides immediate, performance-based feedback to trainees using machine learning.  The current Fast-Track SBIR proposal partners ​Lyssn​ with Prevention Research Institute (PRI), who has a long track-record of training counselors in evidence-based approaches for AUD and currently trains approximately 1,250 counselors per year. Phase I will adapt ClientBot to an AUD training context, including understanding PRI training workflows, assessing usability, and accuracy of machine learning based MI feedback. Phase II will conduct a field-based usability trial and a randomized training trial (N = 200 PRI trainees) to evaluate the effectiveness of ClientBot on learning of MI skills compared to a wait-list and PRI training-as-usual. Analyses will also examine the hypothesized mechanisms of behavior change underlying ClientBot’s MI skills training. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on role plays with peers and human judgment for training and performance-based feedback and support commercialization of a ClientBot product for training of AUD counselors in evidence-based practices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Training counselors in evidence-based treatments for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) requires repeated opportunities for skills practice with performance-based feedback, which is challenging to provide at scale. Building on an existing prototype, ​Lyssn.io​ – a technology start-up focused on scalable and cost-efficient human-centered technologies – will enhance and evaluate an AI-based, conversational agent (ClientBot) that simulates a realistic client with alcohol concerns and provides performance-based feedback to support counselor training.",ClientBot: A conversational agent that supports skills practice and feedback for Motivational Interviewing for AUD,10009084,R44AA028463,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nonprofit Organizations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevention Research', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Role', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Sports', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Vision', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'alcohol testing', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral health', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'peer', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIAAA,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R44,2020,397456,-0.04527506114897757
"The Development and Systematic Evaluation of an AI-Assisted Just-in-Time-Adaptive-Intervention for Improving Child Mental Health PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Early childhood mental health problems constitute a significant public health concern with wide-ranging impacts on functioning both concurrently and later in life. Although childhood mental health is influenced by a variety of factors, the quality of relationships with caregivers plays a critical role. Critical, coercive, and conflictual parent- child interactions have been consistently linked with increased risk of externalizing and internalizing symptoms, whereas supportive and nurturing relationships have been shown to confer protective effects. Early intervention of maladaptive family relationships is thus crucial for preventing or offsetting negative developmental trajectories in at-risk children. A variety of therapeutic methods have been developed and employed to foster positive parent- child relationships and improve child mental health, including parent training/education, in-person therapy, home visiting, school curriculums, and web programs. However, systematic obstacles interfere with the accessibility, generalizability, and acceptability of these traditional appointment- and module-based approaches. Furthermore, limitations in the family-centered flexibility, individual responsiveness, and broad availability of these services render them inadequate to address the unique needs of at-risk populations who would benefit from more readily accessible and inexpensive 24-hour support that is provided in real time and real life—when and where support is needed most. Not surprisingly, research finds that roughly half of the families who do participate in traditional appointment- and module-based mental health services fail to show sufficient symptom improvement. Just-in- time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), in contrast, utilize smartphones, wearables, and artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and respond to psychological and behavioral processes and contextual events as they unfold in everyday life. Although JITAIs have the potential to transform the way people receive mental health support, barriers to their successful, wide-scale implementation remain. Using pilot data collected from smartphones and wearables, our interdisciplinary team of psychologists and engineers used AI to build machine learning algorithms to detect psychological states and contextual events, such as ongoing moods and relationship conflict, in couples. In the current project, we propose developing and testing a JITAI to provide opportune supports to families in dynamic response to contextual events and shifting psychological states to amplify attachment bonds, regulate emotion, and intervene in maladaptive parent-child interactional patterns. Building on our prior research, we will (1) build software to unobtrusively capture real-time data from commercially-available mobile devices, (2) use machine learning to develop algorithms to automatically monitor psychological and behavioral processes relevant to child mental health, (3) launch a JITAI to provide as-needed intervention, and (4) carry out a micro-randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of our JITAI for decreasing child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Our project will contribute to the development of technology ecosystems and service delivery models with the power to meaningfully transform the accessibility and dynamic responsiveness of mental health care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mental health problems in childhood are highly prevalent and impairing, placing an immense social and economic burden on society. Parent-child relationships in the early years of life play a critical role in promoting child mental health, with critical and coercive relationships increasing the risk of mental health problems across the lifespan. Our project includes the creation and systematic evaluation of an innovative technology-based therapy system that employs artificial intelligence to monitor and responsively administer dynamic (i.e., as needed) supports to families in real-world settings in order to promote positive family relationships and improve child mental health.",The Development and Systematic Evaluation of an AI-Assisted Just-in-Time-Adaptive-Intervention for Improving Child Mental Health,10010441,R42MH123368,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Mental Health', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Coercion', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family Relationship', 'Fostering', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Home visitation', 'Hour', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychologist', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Service delivery model', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training and Education', 'Underserved Population', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'analytical method', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'contagion', 'cost effective', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'early childhood', 'efficacy testing', 'family support', 'flexibility', 'foster child', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective effect', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'response', 'service delivery', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technology development', 'therapeutic effectiveness']",NIMH,COLLIGA APPS CORP.,R42,2020,416822,-0.003982184951104816
"Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is a lethal neoplasm and a common hematologic malignancy. MM is uniformly preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Unlike MM, patients with MGUS are asymptomatic. The current management for MGUS is watchful waiting for disease progression. A marked racial disparity in this disease area is long-established with a 2 to 3-fold increased risk in African Americans (AAs) compared to Caucasians. Moreover, obesity is a risk factor for MM independent of race. Obesity is prevalent in U.S. adults, and particularly more prevalent among AAs than Caucasians. As a result, without any intervention, racial disparities in this disease will continue to worsen. Metformin, a widely-used, safe, well- tolerated, and inexpensive medication, induces weight loss and has been found to be more effective in glycemic control in AAs compared to Caucasians. It has also been used in prospective trials for non-diabetes indications and solid tumor malignancies. We therefore hypothesize that metformin use in MGUS patients will prevent MM and reduce MM disparities. This project plans to focus on the precursor condition of MM – MGUS. The findings from the proposed project will inform biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials. The long-term goal is to identify intervention strategies to prevent the progression of MGUS to MM, reduce the overall burden of MM, and reduce MM disparities. We plan to identify whether high body mass index (BMI) and/or significant change in BMI over the life course are risk factors for MGUS by race (Aim 1), utilizing linked databases with nearly lifelong follow-up of BMI and other health measures ,as well as utilizing artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning approaches, to perform big data analyses. We will then assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory after MGUS diagnosis in metformin versus non-metformin users in a subgroup of MGUS patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (Aim 2.1) and the association of metformin use with the progression of MGUS to MM (Aim 2.2). Last, we will assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory in the subgroup of MGUS patients without diabetes mellitus (Aim 3). This project is significant in its capability to 1) identify perhaps the only modifiable risk factor (high BMI) to inform interventions to prevent MM; 2) identify a dynamic marker for disease progression by race (M-protein concentration), where these biomarkers can be a surrogate for MM diagnosis in future prevention trials; and 3) reduce MM health disparities by a) identifying race-specific biomarkers for MGUS and MGUS progression, available through clinical encounters (as opposed to expensive genetic testing); and b) exploring metformin use as a chemopreventive measure. It is innovative in its 1) focus on MM prevention rather than treatment and 2) utilization of artificial intelligence to analyze big data. Successful completion of this study will provide evidence for a paradigm shift in current clinical practice of MGUS management and help prevent MM, an incurable and costly disease. More importantly, it will provide evidence to guide interventions to reduce MM disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in multiple myeloma (MM), a common and incurable malignancy whose management is extremely costly, are long-established. Although MM is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by many years, no established prevention strategies exist and current clinical practice does not treat patients with MGUS; thus, racial disparities for this disease are expected to persist or even worsen due to the disproportionate burden of obesity – a known risk factor for MM – in the African American population. This project plans to study racial differences in risk factors/biomarkers for MGUS and the progression of MGUS to MM to inform future biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials with the goal of reducing MM health disparities.",Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective,10055834,R01CA253475,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caucasians', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Department of Defense', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metformin', 'Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Neoplasms', 'Obesity', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Race', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Subgroup', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'diabetic', 'follow-up', 'genetic testing', 'glycemic control', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'innovation', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'specific biomarkers', 'working group']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,360281,-0.021654891368820477
"Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers” 7. Project Summary We will test Adapt2Quit, an innovative Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational Messaging System. Adapt2Quit uses complex, machine-learning algorithms to adaptively select the best messages for a smoker, based upon multiple attributes, including: 1) the smoker’s profile; 2) the smoker’s explicit feedback over time to the system; and 3) data from thousands of prior smokers’ profiles and their feedback patterns. Adapt2Quit’s type of machine- learning is called a recommender system. Outside healthcare, companies (like Amazon) use recommender systems to continuously learn from user feedback (e.g.: liked product, products purchased) to improve, thus enhancing personal relevance and customer engagement. Engagement is a huge challenge for digital health. In the field of computer-tailored health messaging, Adapt2Quit is the first to use machine-learning to continuously adapt to feedback and select new personalized messages to send to smokers. To evaluate the impact of the recommender system, Adapt2Quit will be compared with a robust, active control, a simple but effective messaging system. In our pilot experiment, Adapt2Quit outperformed the control, especially among socio- economically disadvantaged (SED) smokers. SED smokers are harder to engage in interventions. Thus, Adapt2Quit’s increased engagement will be of particular importance for targeting SED smokers. In addition to the potential impact of the Adapt2Quit messages in inducing and engaging smokers in cessation, our goal is to increase use of the state Quitline. We will recruit 700 SED smokers at two sites. All smokers will complete a baseline interview and receive a paper brochure with information about the state’s Quitline. Smokers will then be randomized to: Adapt2Quit or the standard messaging. As the system is designed to enhance engagement, and through engagement lead to positive actions, Aim 1 will focus on engagement [Hypothesis (H1a) Among Adapt2Quit smokers, those with higher engagement levels (completed more ratings) will have greater scores on the perceived competence scale (PCS)]. Aim 2 compares (Adapt2Quit and control) behavior change processes including perceived competence for smoking cessation and cessation supporting actions (calling a Quitline) [H2a: Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater scores on the PCS than control smokers; H2b: Adapt2Quit smokers will adopt more cessation supporting actions (Quitline, NRT) than control smokers]. Aim 3 will assess effectiveness of the system [H3a: (primary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater smoking cessation rates (6-month point prevalence biochemically verified) than control smokers; H3b: (secondary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have lower time to first quit attempt than control smokers; H3c: (mediation analysis) Measured internal and external processes will mediate the effect of Adapt2Quit on smoking cessation]. To accomplish the above aims, we have brought together a multidisciplinary team with relevant expertise, and a strong track record of collaboration. 8. Narrative We propose testing Adapt2Quit — an innovative motivational texting “recommender system.” Adapt2Quit enhances tailored motivational messaging systems using machine-learning algorithms to learn from, and adapt to, user feedback (prior and daily message ratings), thereby increasing message personal relevance. Our study will test Adapt2Quit motivational messaging texting with socioeconomically disadvantaged (SED) smokers.","Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers”",9954825,R01CA240551,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biochemical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Motivation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Self Determination', 'Self Efficacy', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking and Health Research', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'active control', 'base', 'behavior change', 'design', 'digital', 'disadvantaged population', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'health care settings', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning progression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine replacement', 'primary outcome', 'quitline', 'recruit', 'rural healthcare', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,712077,-0.11008404850668009
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9829561,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computer science', 'craving', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2020,165045,0.0055587465795541025
"Deep Learning of Street View Imagery to assess Urban Green Space Relationships with Mental Health:  A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY The built environment is an important modifiable determinant of human health, yet our ability to understand its effects on human health have been limited by the lack of scalable data on specific components (and exposures) of the built environment. The emergence of ubiquitous geo-referenced imagery in the United States (e.g. Google Street View Imagery), combined with recent advances in image processing using deep learning algorithms, offers unprecedented opportunity for measuring street-level built environment features at scales needed for population-based research. To develop and demonstrate the potential of deep learning algorithms for environmental health research we will: develop methods to assess green space features using street view imagery and deep learning algorithms; create new deep learning algorithms to predict urban green space quality, stress reduction and restorative potential; and apply new street view measures to 9,070 adult Twin Pairs in the Washington Twin Registry to determine associations between green space and mental health. Our proposed study will dramatically move the field of environmental health forward by provided a completely new, transferable and scalable exposure assessment method for assessing built environment exposures relevant to human health and provide robust information on how urban green space influences mental health. Overall, our new approach will provide rich new data sources for environmental epidemiologists, city planners, policy makers and neighborhoods and communities at large. PROJECT NARRATIVE The built environment is an important determinant of human health, yet our ability to measure specific components of the built environment relevant to health is limited.

"Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Because suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide and suicide attempt) significantly contributes to global disease and financial burden, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, the World Health Organization, and prominent researchers have called for the need to develop and improve prediction models for suicidal behavior. The period after contact with a health care professional is a particularly high-risk period, suggesting that prediction of suicidal behavior in the short-term after contact (i.e., defined as within one year in most studies) would address a critical need in the field to aid intervention efforts. However, previous short-term research has been limited by numerous factors, including a lack of research on youth samples, an overreliance on self-report measures or electronic health records, and the frequent examination of bivariate associations between only one predictor and suicidal behavior. The overall objective of the current proposal is to utilize several algorithms and assess their relative performance in the prediction of short-term suicidal behavior after contact with an outpatient specialist (defined as within 1, 6, and 12 months) using an unparalleled dataset. I will use data from a prospective, large-scale register of all outpatient mental health specialist visits among youth in Stockholm County, Sweden, consisting of approximately 160,000 visits by the onset of the current award. These individuals can be linked to population-based registers assessing a broad range of information (e.g., medical problems, academic information, neighborhood factors, parental psychopathology), which is a significant advantage over prior literature primarily studying demographic and psychiatric predictors in isolation. The central hypothesis is that the examination of numerous predictors within a large sample and the use of advanced statistical methods will significantly improve upon previous suicidal behavior prediction, which has remained slightly above chance. To achieve the overall objective, the current proposal is designed to apply machine learning algorithms through two specific aims: Aim 1: Apply variable selection algorithms that determine a limited number of salient predictors and, therefore, maximize interpretability; Aim 2: Apply ensemble algorithms that aggregate machine learning models and, therefore, maximize predictive power. The current proposal will significantly contribute to the field by examining short-term risk using machine learning techniques among a youth, outpatient sample, including varying follow-up windows and predictors across domains. Finally, the results from the current proposal will have positive impact by informing both 1) basic research through the identification of at-risk subgroups based on numerous predictors, and 2) the creation of a prediction tool that will aid in clinical practice. Project Narrative Over the past 50 years, prediction of suicidal behavior has remained slightly above chance levels, significantly hindering the development of effective intervention strategies. Because the majority of those who attempt or die by suicide are in contact with a health care professional within the year prior to their death, the current proposal serves to fill a critical gap in suicidal behavior prediction by exploring prediction methods for suicidal behavior among youth in the short-term (i.e., within 1, 6, and 12 months) after contact with an outpatient mental health specialist using an unparalleled dataset. Findings from the current proposal will have implications for clinical practice by identifying high-risk individuals for short-term suicidal behavior and aid clinical decision-making.",Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach,9981424,F31MH121039,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sweden', 'Techniques', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'World Health Organization', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'translational pipeline']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F31,2020,45520,-0.0631310092993651
"Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this R01 project is to develop an automated assessment system that can capitalize on state of the art sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable accurate and early detection of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities. In the USA, 1 in 10 infants are born at risk for these disabilities. For children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, early treatment in the first year of life improves long-term outcomes. However, we are currently held back by inadequacies of available clinical tests to measure and predict impairment. Existing tests are hard to administer, require specialized training, and have limited long- term predictive value. There is a critical need to develop an objective, accurate, easy-to-use tool for the early prediction of long-term physical disability. The field of pediatrics and infant development would greatly benefit from a quantitative score that would correlate with existing clinical measures used today to detect movement impairments in very young infants. To realize a new generation of tests that will be easy to administer, we will obtain large datasets of infants playing in an instrumented gym or simply being recorded while moving in a supine posture. Video and sensor data analyses will convert movement into feature vectors based on our knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach will use machine learning to relate these feature vectors to currently recommended clinical tests or other ground truth information. The power of this design is that algorithms can utilize many aspects of movement to produce the relevant scores. Our preliminary data allows us to lay the following aims: 1)Aim 1: To assess concurrent validity of a multimodal instrumented gym with existing clinical tools. Here, using 150 infants (75 with early brain injury and 75 controls), we will focus on converting data from an instrumented gym into estimates of the standard clinical tests; 2)Aim 2: To develop a computer vision-based algorithm to quantify infant motor performance from single camera video. Here using video data from 1200 infants (400 with early brain injury, 400 preterm without early brain injury, 400 controls), plus those gathered from Aim 1 and Aim 3, we will extract pose data from single-camera video recordings and convert these into kinematic features and relevant scores needed to classify infant movement; 3)Aim3: To discover the features related to long-term motor development. Here we will convert data collected longitudinally from 50 infants (25 with early brain injury and 25 controls) using both instrumented gym and video recordings into estimates standard clinical tests change over time and track features over developmental timescales. These three aims spearhead the use of real world behavior for movement scoring. Our aims will bring us closer to a universal non-invasive test for early detection of neurodevelopmental disabilities and lay the groundwork for long-term prediction of disability. But above all, it promises to scale to infants worldwide, producing an affordable tool to aid in infant health assessment. NARRATIVE Increased survival rates of medically fragile infants lead to an increased number of children with functional impairments later in life. Early detection of motor delays or impairments provides the opportunity for early treatment which improves health outcomes. This study will use state of the art sensors combined with machine learning approaches to develop objective, accurate, easy-to-use tools for the early scoring of deficits and lays the foundation for the early prediction of physical disability.",Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability,9993993,R01HD097686,"['Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Asphyxia', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Birth History', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Educational Status', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand Strength', 'Health', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infant Health', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Birth', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Seizures', 'Supination', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'base', 'critical period', 'design', 'disability', 'drug abuse in pregnancy', 'early screening', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neonatal stroke', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'physically handicapped', 'pressure', 'prognostic tool', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'vector']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,670354,-0.01917217309793567
"Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life ABSTRACT: Emotion regulation (ER) is a key transdiagnostic process and treatment target, with particular relevance to distress disorders (depression, generalized anxiety disorder). Distress disorders, which are characterized by heightened negative emotions, are prevalent conditions with considerable public health burden and comparatively lower response to treatment. The efficacy of interventions for distress disorders may be improved by investigating components of effective ER, both as instructed in the lab (ER capacity) and as measured naturalistically in daily life (ER tendency). Effective ER is based on key components such as accurate perceptions of one's emotions (i.e., emotional awareness) as well sensitivity to the environmental context (i.e., contextual sensitivity), which facilitate the selection and implementation of the appropriate ER strategy. For individuals with distress disorders, elevated levels of perseverative negative thinking (PNT) interferes with these processes, contributing to ER deficits and increased symptoms. This contextualized and integrative model of ER in distress disorders has not been tested, and very little is known about the predictors or outcomes of effective ER tendency—a critical gap given that ER capacity is irrelevant if ER is not employed skillfully in daily life. Furthermore, examinations of ER tendency can show how individuals, considering their particular characteristics and abilities, can optimally match particular ER strategies to the specific situations they encounter. The goal of this application is to evaluate components of ineffective ER— both in the lab and in daily life— that influence the severity and course of distress disorders and functioning. Consistent with NIMH strategic objectives and the RDoC framework, this project incorporates multimodal assessment, dimensional symptom measurement, and machine learning approaches. The proposed study will be comprised of 300 adults, oversampled for elevated PNT (50%). Participants will complete a lab assessment to measure predictors of ER capacity, followed by a 10- day ecological momentary assessment study examining predictors of ER tendency in daily life. To better capture negative emotions as they occur, reports in daily life will be physiologically-triggered with algorithms that detect potential episodes of psychological stress. Effective ER will be operationalized in multiple ways in the lab and in daily life, using self-reported changes in affect, physiological indices, and perceived ER success. Effective ER capacity and tendency will then be examined as predictors of distress symptom, functioning, and well-being trajectories assessed monthly for 12 months. Additionally, an exploratory aim is to create predictive models from a multifaceted battery of theoretically motivated variables that impact ER tendency and subsequent clinical outcomes. To this end, machine learning will be used to build a clinically-relevant framework for how person- level, situation-level, and ER strategy use interact to predict optimal ER. Overall, this project contributes to the long-term goal of identifying and refining targets for personalized interventions, by more precisely isolating key mechanisms of effective ER for specific individuals and the contexts they encounter in their daily lives. Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine predictors (i.e., emotional awareness, contextual sensitivity, perseverative negative thinking) of dysfunctional emotion regulation that contribute to depression and anxiety, as well as to provide an initial framework for optimal emotion regulation in individualized daily life contexts. This study uses multiple measurements (behavioral, psychophysiological, self-report, clinical interview) in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings in daily life, and it focuses on dimensional and transdiagnostic features that underlie multiple disorders. Consistent with NIMH's mission, findings will be relevant to public health because they can help refine intervention targets and inform personalized treatment for depression and anxiety, which are common and impairing conditions.",Emotion Regulation in Distress Disorders: Elucidating the Role of Cognitive Processes and Person-Situation Fit in the Laboratory and Daily Life,9993553,R01MH118218,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Applications Grants', 'Arousal', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'comparative', 'emotion regulation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'random forest', 'response', 'success', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA,R01,2020,441529,-0.0456544973959416
"Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals Project Summary/Abstract The main goal of this study is to build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system that can inform effective recruitment and retention strategies to prevent excessive turnover. High turnover rates (estimated 25-60% annually) are devastating for mental health care systems, affecting organizations (e.g., cost), employees (e.g., work well-being), and most critically, the quality of care. Human resource departments collect extensive employee data that can be useful predictors for turnover, but these data are not often analyzed to address turnover issues in mental health organizations. Computational methods have greatly evolved and can now access and analyze large and complex data. This pilot study will achieve three specific aims: Aim 1: build and test turnover prediction models by developing and applying machine learning algorithms to existing human resource data; Aim 2: generate critical questions to enhance turnover prediction through qualitative methods; and Aim 3: test the enhanced model in predicting turnover at 12 months. In Aim 1, using past human resource data and service encounters from [two mental health organizations (rural and urban locations)], we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict turnover. The algorithms will address turnover questions simultaneously (e.g., Who are the most likely to leave? What factors predict turnover at varying time points in employment?). In Aim 2, we will interview key informants: “leavers” (employees who voluntarily terminate employment during the study); “stayers” (employees with extreme longevity in the organization); and “predictees” (identified as likely to leave, based on our algorithms). The findings will be discussed in two focus groups in order to generate, refine, and validate 5-10 critical questions to enhance prediction of turnover. In Aim 3, we will conduct an on-line survey of all current employees to assess the 5-10 critical questions and link survey data with data from human resources and services to examine the improved precision between the theory-based model (predictors in the survey) and the data-driven model (machine learning algorithms) in predicting actual turnover 12 months later. Machine learning can model complex and dynamic variable relationships (e.g., handling a large number of variables, accounting for heterogeneity) and overcome limitations in traditional turnover research that often relies on small, cross-sectional, and convenience samples. Successful completion of this study will promote data-driven, evidence-based organizational management practices to address turnover, which is aligned with NIMH priorities of capitalizing on existing data structures and using technologies to improve mental health service quality. This study will be a critical step in developing highly adaptable machine learning algorithms to predict turnover; ultimately, we envision that this system will be partnered with future clinical interventions to reduce turnover in mental health. Project Narrative This pilot study will build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system to inform effective recruitment and retention strategies for preventing excessive employee turnover in mental health organizations. Successful retention of a quality workforce not only helps mental health organizations and their employees, but also directly impacts the quality of care that clients receive. In addition, a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system could be partnered with clinical interventions to reduce turnover.",Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals,9895943,R34MH119411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Mental Health Centers', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Effectiveness', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personnel Turnover', 'Pilot Projects', 'Practice Management', 'Predictive Factor', 'Productivity', 'Professional Burnout', 'Psyche structure', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'burnout', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'data resource', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'heterogenous data', 'human data', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental health organization', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'retention rate', 'rural area', 'structured data', 'theories', 'treatment services', 'urban area']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R34,2020,244635,-0.010705187294465478
"Delineating neurobiological heterogeneity in internalizing symptoms using machine learning and deep phenotyping Symptom-based classification approaches based on the DSM 5 are often not supported by epidemiological, genetic, and clinical neuroimaging research and may impede the advancement of interventions that target the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mental health disorders. A novel alternative to classifying psychopathology based on presenting clinical symptoms is to identify neurobiologically-informed biotypes. Individuals are clustered according to shared patterns of brain dysfunction using data-driven machine learning techniques to reveal the heterogeneous biological mechanisms that underlie comorbid disorders. Internalizing symptoms often first begin during development, suggesting that this is a critical period of vulnerability. Additionally, strong sex differences are found in anxiety and depressive symptoms, starting in adolescence. Thus, studies are needed that examine sex differences in the neurobiological mechanisms associated with internalizing symptoms during development. The purpose of the current study is to uncover the neurobiological heterogeneity associated with internalizing symptoms in youth. During the K99 phase, Aim 1 will use machine-learning techniques to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity among youth with anxiety and depressive disorders using multimodal neuroimaging data from a large community-based sample of over 1,200 youth studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; Training phase). We will test these heterogeneous patterns on a hold-out sample from the same cohort to examine the model’s validity (Validation phase). While the PNC provides an ideal dataset for developing a model, it does not have paradigms relevant to fear and anxiety that would allow us to identify important phenotypic differences between biotypes. Thus, Aim 2 will evaluate the generalizability of this model in an independent sample collected during the R00 phase, and further characterize these biotypes using pertinent measures related to error and reward processing. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate how sex differences in brain development associate with heterogeneous neural patterns in internalizing symptoms. Dr. Kaczkurkin’s long-term goal is to establish an independent research program where she will use advanced multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to study the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders in youth. This study will provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on the PNC database at the University of Pennsylvania to develop a well-validated model while also collecting a refined independent dataset, which will provide Dr. Kaczkurkin with the training and experience needed to transition to an independent research career. This study will provide critical knowledge regarding the neurobiological heterogeneity in youth with mood and anxiety disorders. A greater comprehension of how abnormalities in brain function give rise to these symptoms in adolescence is critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments.

"Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anxiety disorders in youth are highly prevalent [1] and impairing [2-4]. Left untreated, these disorders confer substantial additional risk for the development of a wide range of negative sequelae, including substance use [5], suicidal ideation and attempts [6], and additional mental health comorbidities [7]. Although several treatments have demonstrated efficacy for anxiety in youth, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), family CBT (FCBT), medication (MED), and combination of CBT and medication (COMB) [8], a meaningful portion of youth are classified as non-responders after a full course of treatment [9]. The identification of baseline predictors and moderators of response is critical to improve treatment efficacy and reduce burden on families. Increased anxiety severity, comorbidity (behavioral problems, depression), and family psychopathology, along with older age, female gender and anxiety diagnosis, have been highlighted as potential predictors and moderators of outcome. However, studies have been underpowered and findings are inconsistent [10]. To date, all studies have taken a traditional analytic approach, which typically provides conservative estimates as a result of imposed explanatory constraints [11]. Machine Learning (ML) represents a promising complementary statistical technique to traditional analyses, given its focus on predictive fit rather than explanatory inference [12] and will facilitate identification of non-linear, complex patterns of predictors and moderators at the individual level [13, 14]. These methods have shown promise in identification of treatment outcome predictors in other medical [e.g., 15-18] and psychiatric samples [e.g., 19-22], but to date have not been implemented in a sample of anxious youth. The proposed project will aggregate datasets from at minimum ten peer-reviewed and published randomized controlled trials (N=1444) and train and validate two models along overlapping features, including (1) demographics, (2) diagnosis, (3) anxiety severity (4) behavioral problems, and (5) family psychopathology. Models will also be used to examine differential response to ICBT, FCBT, MED and COMB. Aggregated data will be uploaded into a centralized dataset, in line with the NIMH RDoC db and NDAR [23] datasets, and then used to predict outcome for individual anxious youth (N=80) completing ICBT and COMB at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple. The aims of this study are consistent with calls issued in the NIMH strategic plan (Objective 3) and will help facilitate the development of person-centered interventions for anxious youth [24]. An individualized approach to treatment is important to further increase treatment efficacy and reduce the financial and emotional burden associated with non-response [25, 26]. A training plan has been designed that consists of mentorship, formal classwork and experiential learning to develop the applicant's expertise in machine learning and dataset aggregation. The proposed study will take place within Temple University's clinical psychology program, which has a successful track record of conducting impactful NIMH-funded research and training research scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although several efficacious treatments have been identified for youth anxiety, there is significant heterogeneity in treatment response and this heterogeneity is poorly understood. To help clarify differences in treatment response and facilitate the development of person-centered interventions, novel and advanced statistical approaches should be implemented using adequately powered datasets. The proposed study will (1) use machine-learning methods to identify predictors and moderators of outcome in an aggregated dataset of at minimum ten Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining youth anxiety treatments (individual and family cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, and combination treatments), (2) create a centralized dataset of aggregated RCTs to foster continued cross-site collaboration and (3) test the model's predictive accuracy at the individual level in a real-world sample.",Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth,9990935,F31MH123038,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Youth', 'active method', 'anxiety treatment', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'childhood anxiety', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'demographics', 'depression model', 'design', 'expectation', 'family burden', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individual variation', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'parental role', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'social anxiety', 'treatment response']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2020,33509,-0.03638635532163297
"A Transfer Learning Framework for Creating Subject-Specific Musculoskeletal Models of the Hand PROJECT SUMMARY Restoring hand function remains an elusive goal for many clinical conditions, including stroke, osteoarthritis, tetraplegia, amputation, and traumatic injury. The hand’s anatomical complexity makes restoring hand function particularly challenging because altering any one parameter in the hand can have cascading effects that are difficult to predict, but essential to control. In this proposal, as a critical step toward informing personalized treatments for the hand, we will study how subject-specific differences influence hand function. Completion of this proposal will rely on collection of three datasets that are designed to provide varying levels of biomechanical detail and require varying levels of effort to collect. Briefly, these datasets include (1) a simulation dataset containing 500,000 simulations fully describing all musculoskeletal parameters involved in hand force production, (2) a dense, biomechanical datasets that describes the kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity required for hand force production in 30 adults, and (3) a sparse, clinically-inspired dataset that describes demographics, anthropometrics, and clinical metrics of hand function in 1000 adults. In Aim 1, we will leverage the first two datasets to design a data-driven analysis framework that identifies the most important biomechanical parameter(s) and maps how those parameters influence hand force production. Completion of this aim will elucidate the biomechanical mechanisms that modulate hand force production and evaluate the ability to use simulation data, instead of experimental data, to identify these mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will leverage all three datasets to create a transfer learning framework capable of efficiently and accurately predicting subject-specific muscle force-generating parameters from easy to collect clinical data. We specifically focus on muscle force- generating parameters because these parameters remain challenging to quickly and accurately estimate, are known to vary across the population, and are highly related to functional metrics like strength. Completion of this aim will provide a new approach for rapidly estimating subject-specific musculoskeletal parameters, thereby enabling efficient creation of subject-specific models and potentially catalyzing use of such models in a clinical setting. Overall, the results from this study could enhance our ability to provide personalized diagnoses and prognoses for individuals suffering from hand impairments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to understand the biomechanical mechanisms underlying force production in the hand. Specifically, we utilize machine learning methods to examine how subject-specific differences influence hand force production and create subject-specific computer models from easy to obtain clinical data. The results, which integrate modeling with an individual’s clinical data, could enhance our ability to provide personalized diagnoses and prognoses for individuals suffering from hand impairments.",A Transfer Learning Framework for Creating Subject-Specific Musculoskeletal Models of the Hand,10040078,R21EB030068,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amputation', 'Anatomy', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diagnostic', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand Strength', 'Hand functions', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Production', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quadriplegia', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Stroke', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Testing', 'Traumatic injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'bone', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'design', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'hand dysfunction', 'hand rehabilitation', 'individual patient', 'kinematics', 'machine learning method', 'motor control', 'neural network', 'neuromuscular', 'novel strategies', 'open-access repositories', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,560939,-0.015181834183119991
"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function. Our proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s plan to support the design and testing of new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight (Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research).",Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake,9963258,R01DK121703,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Distal', 'Duodenum', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Emetics', 'Emetine', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Ferrets', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Gastric Bypass', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Gastrointestinal Physiology', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hearing', 'Heart Rate', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Rat', 'Laboratory mice', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Satiation', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Vomiting', 'awake', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gastric fundus', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal function', 'healthy weight', 'heart rate variability', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'side effect', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,508751,-0.003594561885134041
"Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs PROJECT SUMMARY Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. As the disease remains largely asymptomatic until late stages, there is a pressing need to develop affordable approaches for screening before visual impairment occurs. Although sophisticated imaging technologies such as Spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) can provide highly reproducible and accurate quantitative assessment of glaucomatous damage, their application in widespread screening or non-specialized settings is unfeasible, given the high cost and operator requirements. Fundus photography is a low-cost alternative that has been used successfully in teleophthalmology programs. However, subjective human grading of fundus photos for glaucoma is poorly reproducible and highly inaccurate, as gradings tend to largely over- or underestimate damage. We propose a new paradigm for assessing glaucomatous damage by training a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network to provide quantitative estimates of the amount of neural damage from fundus photographs. In our Machine-to-Machine (M2M) approach, we trained a DL network to analyze fundus photos and predict quantitative measurements of glaucomatous damage provided by SDOCT, such as retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and neuroretinal rim measurements. Our preliminary results showed that the M2M predictions have very high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT observations. This provides an objective method to quantify neural damage in fundus photos without requiring human graders, which could potentially be used for screening, diagnoses and monitoring in teleophthalmology and non- specialized point-of-care settings. In this proposal, we aim at refining and validating the M2M model in suitable, large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records, and clinical trial data. Our central hypothesis is that the M2M approach will be more accurate than subjective human gradings in screening, diagnosing, predicting and detecting longitudinal damage over time. In Aim 1, we will investigate the performance of the M2M model to screen for glaucomatous damage using large datasets from 6 population-based studies: Blue Mountains Eye Study, Los Angeles Latino Eye Study, Tema Eye Survey, Beijing Eye Study, Central India Eye and Medical Study and the Ural Eye and Medical Study, which will provide data on over 25,000 subjects of diverse racial groups. In Aim 2, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model to predict future development of glaucoma in eyes of suspects using the data from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS). In Aim 3, we will investigate the ability of the M2M model in detecting glaucomatous progression over time using data from the Duke Glaucoma Registry, a large database of longitudinal structure and function data in glaucoma with over 25,000 patients followed over time. If successful, this proposal will lead to a validated, inexpensive, and widely applicable tool for screening, early diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma, that could be applied under population-based settings and also at non-specialized point-of-care settings. Project Narrative Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment in the world. This proposal will employ a novel artificial intelligence paradigm for quantifying neural damage on ocular fundus photographs for the purpose of screening, diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma damage. The approach will be validated on large datasets from population-based studies, electronic medical records and clinical trial data.","Objective Quantification of Neural Damage for Screening, Diagnosis and Monitoring of Glaucoma with Fundus Photographs",10047364,R21EY031898,"['Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blindness', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fundus', 'Fundus photography', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'India', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Latino', 'Los Angeles', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Ocular Hypertension', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Reference Standards', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual impairment', 'algorithm training', 'clinical care', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'hypertension treatment', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning network', 'longitudinal database', 'novel', 'optic nerve disorder', 'point of care', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'screening', 'time use', 'tool']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,241500,-0.03774995077581928
"Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have well-established risk factors such as physical activity (PA), depression, and hypertension (HTN). These risk factors disproportionately affect racial minority populations, but the mechanisms underlying racial health disparities are not well understood. In this, geographic factors could be key, as PA, depression and HTN are strongly affected by geographic exposures, including green space. However, green space is typically measured with questionnaires, which have substantial error, or satellite-based indexes that are nonspecific and provide no information on the type of vegetation (e.g., tree vs. grass), nor whether the vegetation is within view at the street level. As a result, no study has quantified the contribution of green space to racial disparities in ADRD. And while novel technologies such as Google Street Views (GSV) imaging are promising data sources for capturing unique measures of green space, managing, processing, and analyzing high-dimensional data present significant logistical and analytical challenges, especially when linking these data to existing data from large prospective cohorts. Finally, we need to understand green space in the context of other potentially correlated geographic exposures, or the urban exposome—the totality of life- course geographic exposures (the set of green space, air pollutants, noise, built environment, and social environment)—to estimate which factors drive health. This proposal will address these challenges by using GSV imaging to assess the effect of green space on PA, depression, and HTN, as well as subsequent ADRD risk within the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)—a 10-year longitudinal study of 6,814 men and women without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline from 4 racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic White, African-American, Chinese, and Hispanic). Aim 1 will quantify the effect of specific aspects of green space (e.g. trees, grass, shrubs, plants) on ADRD and cognitive decline and evaluate whether these associations differ according to race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will determine the indirect effect of green space on ADRD that is mediated through PA, depression, and HTN. Aim 3 will quantify exposome associations with ADRD and cognitive decline using untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques and evaluate whether they differ according to race/ethnicity. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) implementing deep learning algorithms to analyze high-resolution geographic data, (2) cognitive function epidemiology, and (3) developing and refining data-driven approaches to perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies. These combined plans will successfully prepare the applicant for an independent research career focused on identifying modifiable geographic determinants of ADRD in diverse populations using innovative measures of geographic context. Project Narrative Green space or trees and natural vegetation can provide mental health benefits and possibly lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); however, green space is often measured poorly in epidemiologic research. I propose to integrate high-resolution images from Google Street Views to derive ground-level objective measurements of green space into a diverse prospective cohort study using deep learning algorithms, mediation analysis and geographic mixtures. This research will enable unprecedented perspectives on exposures that drive ADRD and related cognitive decline risk, and will provide translational insights into potential interventions to optimize opportunities for ADRD prevention and reduce racial disparities in ADRD.",Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment,9952648,K99AG066949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air Pollutants', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Baltimore', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chicago', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Los Angeles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Plants', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Social Environment', 'Social Impacts', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'built environment', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'economic impact', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'healthy aging', 'high resolution imaging', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'men', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial disparity', 'racial health disparity', 'racial minority', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'urban public health']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2020,129600,-0.034899372557895186
"Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity ABSTRACT Regular exercise (physical activity) is the most effective intervention that promotes health and combats non- communicable disease (NCD). However, our understanding of the molecule(s) responsible for the superb benefits of exercise is obscure. The NIH Common Fund project “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)” is a large-scale discovery study designed to understand the molecular responses to exercise training, which has released the first batch of multi-omics data, including RNA-seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics, from 5 tissues collected at different time points in rats following an acute bout of endurance exercise. These endeavors have laid a solid foundation for elucidation of the molecular transducer of physical activity. We have recently made significant progress in four areas, which poised us to explore these data and elucidate the mechanism(s) in an unprecedented manner. Specifically, 1) We have obtained similar time-course, transcriptomics data in 4 tissues in mice following acute and long-term endurance exercise and developed machine learning capability for mining the multi-omics data for identification of regulatory factors that mediate the exercise benefits; 2) We have perfected CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for generation of loss- of-function knock-in mice as well as techniques to generate tissue-specific, inducible gain-of-function transgenic mice; 3) We have established comprehensive phenotypic analysis in mice; and 4) We have had a successful experience in elucidating the regulation and function of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), a humoral factor expressed in skeletal muscle and promoted by endurance exercise, in mediating the health benefits and protection against diseases. We hypothesize that endurance exercise promotes expression and release of one or more humoral factors from one or multiple tissues/organs, which is sufficient and necessary mediating the health benefits of exercise. To this end, we propose 1) Identify candidate molecular transducers of physical activity by machine learning-based multi-omics modeling. 2) Generate loss-of-function knock-in and tissue-specific, gain-of-function transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing and transgenesis. 3) Elucidate the role of the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity in health benefits of exercise. The experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced adaptations with great potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for NCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since ancient times, physical activity has been well-known to improve health and prevents disease, but the understanding of biological molecule(s) responsible for the health benefits is still obscure.

"Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study Efforts to decipher biological signatures for mental illness now focus increasingly on adolescence, a period of rapid brain development that immediately precedes the peak age of onset for many disorders. Maturation of the cerebral cortex during this time has long been thought to mediate emergence of early symptoms. However, while specific cortical changes have been implicated in a small number of specific syndromes, for the most part, patterns in cortical development that underlie the differentiation of psychopathology remain uncertain. The ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unprecedented opportunity to align emergence of specific patterns of psychopathology with specific changes in cortical maturation. Over the next 5 years, ABCD will obtain annual, standardized measures dimensional psychopathology, and biennial MRI scans, of 11,875 youths across 21 US-based sites, covering age 9 to 16. The proposed studies will leverage this longitudinal design to discover regionally- and temporally-specific features of cortical development that associate with emergence of dimensional psychopathology, and then to relate these patterns to specific profiles of underlying genomic and environmental risk. Analysis of baseline data from age 9-10, included in this application, indicates that psychopathology is in early stages of differentiation, although already strongly related to polygenic risk for child-onset disorders, and to well- established pre- and post-natal environmental insults. Aim 1 of the proposed studies will juxtapose clinical and imaging data from baseline through three follow-up time points, focusing primarily on whether departures from neurotypical age-related cortical thinning trajectories (assessed via intercept, slope, and quadratic indices) associate with emergence of specific dimensions of illness. The precise temporal alignment of clinical and cortical thinning trajectories will take an initial step towards inferring causal relationships, which will be further substantiated through triangulation with genomic (Aim 2) and environmental (Aim 3) risk profiles. Polygenic scoring methods developed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium will be used to determine whether cortical maturation trajectories developed in Aim 1 mediate relationships between genomic risk and emergent dimensional psychopathology. Then, using data from hundreds of environmental measures that canvass participants’ daily activities, nutrition, life stressors, socioeconomic status, family dynamics, neighborhood safety, and numerous other factors, we will use novel machine learning methods to develop profiles of exposomic risk factors that predict emergent dimensional psychopathology, and determine whether cortical maturation patterns mediate the relationship between environmental risk profiles and clinical course. By the conclusion of the proposed studies we hope to establish specific cortical signatures that bridge causal factors with emergent psychopathology in adolescence, and that can be leveraged to develop new preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Adolescence is a critical period for emergence of a range of psychiatric syndromes, as well as for maturation of the cerebral cortex. Investigators have long presumed these events to be linked, potentially in ways that can predict specific clinical outcomes, but until now we have lacked data from sufficiently large, prospective studies to establish definitive or tractable patterns. Leveraging data from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (n=11,875), we will map emergent psychopathology across a range of symptoms to specific patterns of cortical development from age 9 to 16, and anchor these relationships to mediating genomic and environmental risk factors.",Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study,10096054,R01MH124694,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family dynamics', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'critical period', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal', 'psychiatric genomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'standardize measure', 'stressor', 'theories']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,413200,-0.012172357323147207
"Prospective Health Outcomes and Inflammatory Biomarkers Associated with e-Cigarette Use Project Summary. This project is designed to identify validated biomarkers for use in the assessment of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) by the FDA. Since the introduction of ENDS, commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products. With the goal of validated biomarker discovery in two independent cohorts, the COPDGene and UCSD ENDS studies, we propose to identify ENDS-related inflammatory biomarkers in ENDS only and dual users and relate these biomarkers to five-year lung health outcomes. COPDGene is an ongoing, longitudinal study of >6,000 current and former traditional cigarette (t-cig) smokers enriched for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with detailed longitudinal lung phenotyping data (including chest CT), genome-wide blood RNA-seq, and proteomic data. The UCSD ENDS Study is a controlled study of young ENDS only users and controls with detailed assessment of inflammatory biomarkers in the oropharynx, airways and blood.  Biomarkers used as validated surrogate measures must be 1) associated with ENDS use, 2) predictive of health outcomes, and 3) have a strong biological rationale. We hypothesize that inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use will be predictive of five-year lung health effects. In Aim 1 of this proposal, discovery of inflammatory transcriptomic and proteomic biomarkers of ENDS exposure will be performed in subjects from the COPDGene five-year study visit, and biomarkers will be validated in two independent sets of subjects from the COPDGene ten-year visit and the UCSD ENDS Study. In Aim 2 we will identify antibody-specific adaptive immune response biomarkers of ENDS exposure using adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq). Auto-antibodies are biomarkers that are associated with the degree of lung damage in COPD. AIRR-seq is a powerful tool for inflammatory biomarker discovery that characterizes an individual’s decades-long history of antibody responses. In Aim 3 we will use machine learning predictive models to relate ENDS-associated biomarker panels to five-year lung health outcomes from COPDGene. The investigative team for this grant is well-positioned to identify novel inflammatory biomarkers of ENDS use. The COPDGene and UCSD cohorts have the detailed lung phenotyping and molecular characterization necessary to discover and clinically validate biomarkers in two important populations of ENDS users, i.e. ENDS only and dual users. Public Health Relevance: Since the introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), commonly referred to as e-cigarettes, there has been a large increase in ENDS use among young adults and older traditional cigarette smokers who also use ENDS (dual users). Since 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had regulatory authority over ENDS, and there is an acute need for ENDS-related biomarkers that can be used as validated surrogate endpoints for evaluation of new ENDS products.

"Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP) Abstract Placental abruption is an obstetrical complication defined as premature placental separation. Despite its elusive etiology, it is believed to be the consequence of acute stimuli – ischemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress at the maternal‐fetal interface – associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in (premature) placental separation. The study of abruption and maternal and newborn long‐term cardiovascular and hemorrhagic/thrombotic cerebrovascular events is the central focus of the proposed project. We will examine the long‐term impact of abruption on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in women and in their children. We will also investigate the relationship of clinical classification (mild and severe forms) of abruption, risks based on abruption across successive pregnancies, and abruption in twin pregnancies, on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We will undertake a causal mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which these associations may be mediated through (i) preterm delivery and (ii) small for gestational age births. We will perform this analysis by clinical classification of abruption and estimate the extent of mediation following corrections for both measured (socio‐demographic characteristics, including maternal smoking, comorbid medical conditions, and obstetrical events), and unmeasured confounding. A unique aspect of this project will be to identify, through applications of Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning algorithms, subsets of women at high risk for abruption and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. Finally, we will examine whether maternal race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are effect measure modifiers of the association between abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We propose to address these aims through a large population‐based epidemiologic study, utilizing data from the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS), a New Jersey statewide database of all patients admitted to all non‐federal acute care hospitals in NJ with a CVD diagnosis, with longitudinal follow‐up of up to 30 years. The MIDAS data will be linked to the NJ fetal death and linked live birth‐ infant death data with associated maternal and newborn hospitalization data between 1980‐2017 to create one of the largest and most comprehensive databases in the US to evaluate the extent to which sentinel events in pregnancy impart lasting risk for women's and children's health later in life. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, policy implications and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE) The overarching goal of this project is to examine the associations between placental abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. The project will focus on overall associations, as well as identifying subsets of women at high risk based on abruption severity, recurrent abruptions, gestational age at delivery, and fetal growth restriction. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, and policy implications regarding women's health, and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.",Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP),10051711,R01HL150065,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Birth', 'Cardiovascular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Life', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'New Jersey', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patients', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rupture', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Small for Gestational Age Infant', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'acute care', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'health of the mother', 'high risk', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'improved', 'infant death', 'insight', 'interest', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal risk', 'mortality', 'obstetrical complication', 'policy implication', 'population based', 'premature', 'screening guidelines', 'sociodemographics', 'stillbirth', 'support vector machine']",NHLBI,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,707286,-0.014627732289393134
"VR-Based Evaluation and Training System for Emergency Responders and Managers Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) systems are increasingly being utilized as training platforms for complex, extremely demanding or rarely executed tasks. Often, VR systems focus primarily on delivering increasingly realistic scenarios for training purposes without any capability to assess or refine trainee performance in situ. Our novel VR training platform to deliver HAZMAT training not only delivers realistic scenarios, but also measures and evaluates performance using scientifically validated measures of variables associated with both individual and team performance. The advantage of our approach is to immerse first responders in HAZMAT emergency scenarios that are realistic and also designed to focus on measurement and refinement of specific areas of performance. Key contributors to performance among emergency responders and managers were identified by an extensive review of the literature and subsequent tested for association by psychometric assessment of over three hundred emergency responders. A subset of 18 highly associated contributors were then identified through statistical analysis of survey results. These contributors can be measurably represented in VR Training scenario elements. Performance related to each can then be measured and assessed for individual or team trainees. These refined key contributors can then be validated on larger, more diverse samples of emergency responders using the beta version of our proposed VR-based system. Our VR system is also a configurable platform that enables the evaluation and training of a wide range of skills needed by distinct roles (police, firefighters, EMTs, etc.) in diverse scenarios such as biosafety spills, HAZMAT disasters and bioterrorism threats. Also, HAZMAT disasters that are rare or very difficult/costly to create real world training events can be more easily and cost effectively mastered. Scenarios also can be dynamically modulated by trainer input in real-time, or by computerized Artificial Intelligence analysis of performance and trainee real-time physiological measures to rapidly optimize specific key contributor performance of individuals and teams. Rapid, efficient and effective training of emergency responders serves the ultimate goal of minimizing potential catastrophic consequences of these events.

"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project assembles leading cavernous angioma researchers with the aim of developing blood tests for the diagnosis and prediction of symptomatic brain hemorrhage, a critical clinical challenge in a disease affecting more than a million Americans. We further examine whether blood biomarkers can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional bleeding.

"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders.

"Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future  infection Project Summary / Abstract Background: Trachoma, caused by ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. This goal will be achieved in many countries, but some regions in Ethiopia maintain persistently high levels of infection despite >10 years of intensive control activities. A small proportion of the population likely harbors the majority of trachoma infections, with foci of infection (“hotspots”) at or below the village scale; the operational challenge is accurately predicting where they are with existing data. Advances in machine learning and spatial data science have demonstrated marked improvements in the spatial resolution of predictions for diseases like malaria. Among available biomarkers of trachoma, IgG antibody responses in children could enable more accurate predictions because they integrate exposure over time and reflect recent transmission. Aims: The principal aims of this study are to evaluate whether antibody measurements can identify stable hotspots of trachoma infection, and whether a novel machine learning approach can accurately predict village- level trachoma infection forward in time (up to 3 years). We hypothesize that infection will be concentrated in the population and that hotspots of infection will be at the village level. We further hypothesize that antibody measurements in young children will provide a stable source of information about trachoma transmission that will enable us to accurately predict villages with high levels of future C. trachomatis infection. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we will draw on measurements from a well characterized population across 40 villages enrolled in a NIH-funded cluster randomized trial in Ethiopia’s Amhara Region (U10-EY023939). The three-year trial is designed to measure the effect of improved water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) on trachoma infection in the absence of azithromycin treatment. The trial has collected clinical and biomarker measurements from approximately 2,400 children ages 0-9 years at enrollment and in annual visits over 3 years. We will characterize the spatial scale of transmission using the !-statistic, which equals the relative risk of infection within different distances of cases. We will use a permutation-based, spatial scan statistic to identify hotspots using IgG antibody and PCR measures in each year, and will determine if they are stable over time. Using geospatial ensemble machine learning, we will predict trachoma seroprevalence as a function of remotely sensed, geospatial information and limited enrollment characteristics. We will rank order villages by predicted seroprevalence, and will assess the proportion of PCR C. trachomatis infections in top-ranked villages 1, 2, and 3 years later. We will repeat the analysis using predicted clinical symptoms as a comparator. The development of methods to make accurate, fine-scale predictions of future C. trachomatis infection will lay the groundwork for a future adaptive randomized trial that preferentially allocates more intensive intervention to villages predicted at enrollment to have high future levels of infection. Project Narrative / Lay Language Description Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide and has been targeted for global elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Trachoma control programs target and monitor activities at the level of districts, but it is likely that infection hotspots are concentrated at much smaller scales and could be missed in district-level averages. We propose to combine antibody-based measures of exposure with state-of-the-art machine learning to develop predictions of trachoma infection at the scale of individual villages in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which would represent a substantial increase in the resolution of information available to guide control and monitoring efforts.",Seroepidemiologic methods to identify hotspots of trachoma and predict future  infection,9974479,R03AI147128,"['Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Azithromycin', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Cholera', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethiopia', 'Eye Infections', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handwashing', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hygiene', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relative Risks', 'Resolution', 'Sanitation', 'Scanning', 'Serological', 'Seroprevalences', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Water', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'novel', 'population based', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'remote sensing', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'transmission process']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2020,87707,-0.017740927211955474
"Informing national guidelines on diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes SUMMARY The diet quality of U.S. childbearing aged women is worse now than any time in the last 50 years. Poor diet quality has been linked with adverse pregnancy outcomes that contribute to infant mortality and pose a tremendous societal burden. Nevertheless, formal recommendations on the diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes are lacking. The US Congress recently mandated that dietary advice for pregnancy be included in the next edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans—the major nutrition policy document that provides dietary advice for health promotion. The USDA/HHS Pregnancy Work Group, which included PI Lisa Bodnar, was charged with summarizing existing knowledge on diet patterns that support healthy pregnancy outcomes to inform the pregnancy-specific guidelines. They identified an evidence base that was entirely insufficient for deriving empirical recommendations and called for research to fill this critical knowledge gap. Our objective is to generate empirical evidence that will inform national dietary guidance on the diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes. We hypothesize that our results will suggest dietary recommendations for pregnant women that will diverge from prevailing nutrition advice. We expect this divergence because our innovative approaches will accommodate the complex synergy among foods in the diet. Using a large, prospective cohort of 7995 U.S. women enrolled at 8 U.S. academic centers, we will quantify the contribution of dietary patterns to variation in risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth <37 weeks, small-for-gestational-age birth, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia). We will use machine learning techniques that allow for complex interactions among dietary components. Then, we will generalize recommended dietary patterns in our sample to the U.S. population of pregnant women using cutting edge “transportability” methods developed in the causal inference literature. Finally, we will develop machine learning algorithms that will identify subgroups who will benefit most from dietary pattern recommendations. The successful completion of this project will provide the Dietary Guidelines Scientific Advisory Committee with empirically-derived data on the ideal dietary patterns for promoting healthy pregnancy outcomes. Our innovative methodologies will serve as a template for nutritional epidemiologists in other areas of health to apply to their data, leading to a broad impact on the Dietary Guidelines. Developing practical data-driven dietary recommendations to optimize pregnancy outcomes will help to reduce the high economic and societal burden of adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve the health of mothers and their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE The Dietary Guidelines for Americans is the cornerstone of nutrition policy in the U.S., impacting WIC and other Federal nutrition assistance programs, health insurance incentives, weight and lifestyle interventions, policies to change the food environment, and nutrition education programs at the national, regional, state and local levels. This project will inform the next edition of the Dietary Guidelines by using cutting-edge analytic approaches to identify diet patterns that promote healthy outcomes of pregnancy. Although the causes of poor pregnancy outcomes are multifactorial, we focus on dietary intake because it is one of the few potentially modifiable risk factors, and has important implications for mother and child well beyond the childbearing years.",Informing national guidelines on diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes,10026261,R01HD102313,"['Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'Area', 'Birth', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Congresses', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Female of child bearing age', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incentives', 'Infant Mortality', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mothers', 'Nulliparity', 'Nutrition Policy', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Requirements', 'Nutritional Support', 'Nutritional status', 'Oils', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pattern', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Small for Gestational Age Infant', 'Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'child bearing', 'cohort', 'dietary control', 'dietary guidelines', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'food environment', 'fruits and vegetables', 'health of the mother', 'healthy pregnancy', 'improved', 'infant death', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'modifiable risk', 'nutrition', 'nutrition education', 'pregnant', 'programs', 'synergism', 'working group']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,645069,-0.003982285583111798
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome,10023944,R01MH119185,"['22q11.2', '3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Rhinometry', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ear', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nasal cavity', 'Neurobiology', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Cortex', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oral cavity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Societies', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdeletion', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory sulcus', 'precision medicine', 'psychotic symptoms', 'resilience', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,740401,-0.016453717546448768
"Rethinking Electronic Fetal Monitoring to Improve Perinatal Outcomes and Reduce Frequency of Operative Vaginal and Cesarean Deliveries The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to fetal hypoxia and ischemia. Its established weaknesses include: 1) the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns and 2) the widespread use of unproven surrogates for relevant fetal hypoxic and/or ischemic injury such as umbilical arterial pH, intrapartum stillbirth, newborn Apgar scores and neonatal seizures. This technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with cerebral palsy. EFM as it is presently used in the clinical setting has been associated with an extraordinary increase in the use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery. No functional algorithm has yet been developed that integrates clinical data collected in the antepartum period and during labor and any other patient specific data with the results of EFM. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of EFM data, especially under real world conditions and in real time where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in significantly decreased use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery while more precisely defining the fetus at risk for developing metabolic acidosis and long term neurologic injury. The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) of the fetal heart rate (FHR) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to oxygen deficiency, but its weaknesses almost all stem from the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns. The widespread use of this technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with severe hypoxic/ischemic neurological disorders, but it has been associated with an extraordinary increase in cesarean delivery rates. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of FHR monitoring data, especially under real world conditions where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes.

"DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease Project Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous: it has many subtypes and the disease progresses at different rates in different subtypes. Disease progression in early-stage PD is observed as signal changes in SPECT imaging with 123I-FP-CIT, which is called DaTscan imaging, or simply DaTscan. The goal of the research proposed here is to create accurate models of heterogeneous PD progression using DaTscan images. Such models will not only provide additional insight into PD, but they are also critically important in assessing the effect of neuro-protective therapy. A new set of models called mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) are proposed to model early-state PD progression as it manifests in DaTscans. MLDS models combine machine-learning methods with linear dynamical system theory. They capture many features of early-stage PD progression: laterality, non-linear progression, as well as PD heterogeneity. Preliminary results show that, MLDS is accurate, finds progression subtypes, relates well to clinical data (MDS-UPDRS motor scores), and gives genuinely new insights about PD progression. The proposed research aims to develop the MLDS methodology in region-of-interest as well as voxel-based frameworks. A detailed discussion of the MLDS theory, model fitting, and the relation to clinical data is included. Longitudinal DaTscan images as well as MDS-UPDRS motor scores are available for over 440 subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), and this data set will be used along with MLDS to create the PD progression models. Project Narrative How Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses is poorly understood. This research proposes to develop precise disease progression models for PD using machine-learning. These models will give greater insight into PD progression and also help assess PD therapy.",DaTscan-based Disease Progression Models for Early-stage Parkinson’s Disease,9902564,R01NS107328,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Glean', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Theory', 'Work', 'base', 'disease heterogeneity', 'dopamine transporter', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'neuron loss', 'presynaptic', 'progression marker', 'putamen', 'research clinical testing', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'uptake']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,353176,-0.022768578843672716
"Factors associated with hospitalization, ICU use and death among vulnerable populations diagnosed with COVID-19 Project Summary. As of April 30, 2020, over 1 million individuals in the U.S. have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with COVID-19 may develop various symptoms – while the majority of patients have mild symptoms, some require hospitalization, admissions to intensive care unit (ICU), and may die. To date, there is only limited knowledge on risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19. First, older adults have been found to have higher risks of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are more likely to be hospitalized or die. Studies have suggested that some underlying conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, or obesity, are associated with the severity of COVID-19. However, it is unknown to what extent these comorbidities explain the variation in the severity of COVID-19, whether older age is independently associated with the severity of COVID-19; and whether and how older age modifies the relationship between comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19. Second, it has been reported that black Americans experienced a higher rate of COVID-related hospitalization and were more likely to die of COVID- 19, compared to white Americans. However, it is unknown what may contribute to such racial difference – whether it is due to the differences in health conditions between blacks and whites, or due to the characteristics of the community where they reside in, or due to some other factors that are also associated with race. The objective of this study is to identify individual risk factors that are associated with the severity of COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalizations, ICU use and death), especially among older adults, and to understand reasons that may contribute to racial differences in COVID-19 severity. To achieve these goals, we will use the daily- updated national Veterans Affairs (VA) data, which contain rich individual-level information on veterans diagnosed with COVID-19. As of April 30, 2020, almost 9,000 veterans have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and about 500 had died, thus providing a large study cohort. This proposed study has two Specific Aims:1) To identify individual risk factors that are associated with COVID-19 related hospitalizations, ICU use and mortality, to understand the role of older age in COVID-19 severity, and to build a predictive model for COVID- 19 severity by machine learning; and 2) To examine reasons for racial differences in illness severity among veterans diagnosed with COVID-19: whether and how such difference is related to individual factors and community characteristics, especially socio-economic status. This study is innovative because it will be the first study to examine the role of multiple risk factors in the severity of COVID-19 by using national data with detailed individual-level information and machine learning algorithm; and it will be the first to examine the reasons, including the role of social determinants, for racial differences in COVID-19 severity. This proposed research is significant as it will help to identify patients with the highest-risk phenotypes, thus providing insights into disease prevention and resource allocation. Project Narrative: This proposed research aims to understand risks factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalization, ICU use and death) and the role of older age in the severity of COVID-19; and to examine reasons leading to racial differences in the severity of COVID-19. This proposed research is highly relevant to public health because the findings from this study will help target prevention strategies and allocation of resources to high-risk populations and help fight this novel infectious disease.","Factors associated with hospitalization, ICU use and death among vulnerable populations diagnosed with COVID-19",10159581,RF1AG063811,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'African American', 'Age', 'COVID-19', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Virus', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'caucasian American', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'fighting', 'health administration', 'health difference', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel virus', 'parent grant', 'predictive modeling', 'racial difference', 'racial health disparity', 'social determinants', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'study population', 'success']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,RF1,2020,578879,-0.0773772141632676
"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",9890853,R01HL121226,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dobutamine', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family suidae', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Ischemia', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'feedforward neural network', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'myocardial injury', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'radio frequency', 'spatiotemporal', 'synthetic construct', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,795348,-0.016271158139341005
"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"Visible-light OCT angiography, velocimetry, and oximetry for characterizing retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma Project Summary Glaucoma damage to the optic nerve and impairment of vision are progressive and irreversible. Understanding mechanisms of glaucomatous injury will help to develop new approaches for treatments that can be used along with traditional therapies that lower intraocular pressure (IOP). Recent developments in optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography have brought increased attention to the role of the inner retinal circulation in glaucoma. To improve our understanding of retinal vascular alterations in glaucoma, we can take advantage of recent developments in visible-light OCT (vis-OCT) to characterize simultaneously tissue structure, vessel density, blood flow and oxygenation. The goal of this project is to further advance vis-OCT by attaining capillary-level measurements, test the value of measuring their local alterations as early indicators of glaucoma and glaucomatous progression and use this to evaluate impaired retinal autoregulation from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss as a potential cause of increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop high-speed, high-sensitivity, high-resolution vis-OCT. The speed will be double that of the current system. A more stable supercontinuum laser will be used to improve system sensitivity, and a tighter focus will be used to improve lateral resolution. This will enable complete detection of capillaries that may be vulnerable to vascular dysfunction. Specific Aim 2 will develop quantitative OCT angiography, velocimetry and oximetry in capillaries as well as arteries and veins. Building on the high-resolution, high-contrast scans acquired in Aim 1, we will use machine learning to segment capillary plexuses, and advanced image processing to extract capillary architecture. Aided by this capillary architecture, we will automatically measure blood flow and oxygenation in capillary segments and incorporate them into a real-time platform. Specific Aim 3 will use this system to demonstrate that acute loss of RGCs, produced by optic nerve transection, alters retinal capillary plexus density, oximetry and velocimetry over time and that these changes precede altered oximetry and flow in larger retinal vessels. We will also show that loss of RGCs impairs the autoregulatory response to acute IOP challenge. In Specific Aim 4, we will demonstrate that optic nerve injury in a model of controlled, elevated IOP produces early alterations in capillary velocimetry, oximetry and autoregulation, show that they are more persistent with advanced injury, and demonstrate the pathophysiologic consequences of these observations. Successful development of this new technology will improve methods of early glaucoma diagnosis and detection of progression. Better understanding of retinal vascular factors that lead to increased susceptibility in advanced glaucoma will lead to improved treatments for these highly vulnerable patients. Project Narrative This project will develop advanced technology to image retinal capillaries and measure capillary blood flow and oxygen content.

"Development of a Wheelchair Maintenance Alert Application for Elderly Wheelchair Users Project Summary Elderly wheelchair users experience wheelchair breakdowns every 2-3 months in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and rural areas of high-income countries. One in three breakdowns leads to adverse physical, social, psychosocial and economic consequences to wheelchair users which increases the public health and personal burden. Preventative wheelchair maintenance has been found to reduce the frequency of wheelchair breakdowns by ten-fold, but compliance with maintenance recommendations is extremely low because they are generic and not reflective of how and where the wheelchair is being used. To address this issue, we are developing a low-cost, scalable maintenance application that leverages artificial intelligence tools to provide maintenance recommendations tailored to how a wheelchair is used. The availability of low-cost technology and widespread use of smartphones by the elderly and people with disabilities in LMICs has led us to develop a smartphone application called WheelTrak that measures wheelchair wear as a function of usage in community. Based on the wear factors, the application produces a Wheelchair Wear Index (WWI) that is representative of wear of critical wheelchair parts that are prone to breakdown. Once a WWI threshold is reached, maintenance is required, and the application notifies the user and/or caregiver who can conduct maintenance to avoid breakdowns and related health consequences. We will conduct a data collection study in collaboration with our wheelchair industry partner – UCP Wheels in El Salvador – and characterize the WWI for the elderly by tracking wear factors which include user’s travel distance, ground shocks and surface vibrations using WheelTrak and a wheel sensor. Based on the trained WWI algorithm, a preventative maintenance schedule will be developed for older adults that can be employed through WheelTrak for maintenance reminders. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to evaluate the usability of the application and gather barriers to maintenance. User feedback will assist us in improving WheelTrak for greater user satisfaction and compliance with maintenance, and addressing any personal or logistical challenges that elderly users and their caregivers or family members may face with conducting maintenance activities in LMICs. Findings from the proposed studies in this application will assist us in planning future studies to investigate the WWI-enabled WheelTrak tool as an intervention to prevent or reduce breakdowns and health consequences with the elderly in LMICs. Preventative maintenance of wheelchairs is necessary to reduce frequent wheelchair breakdowns and corresponding health consequences experienced by the elderly in adverse environments which are commonly present in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). WheelTrak is a smartphone application that measures real-time wheelchair wear in the community during use and triggers preventative maintenance reminders. In this study, we are modelling the application algorithm and collecting user and caregiver feedback to transform WheelTrak into a maintenance intervention tool for elderly wheelchair users in LMICs.",Development of a Wheelchair Maintenance Alert Application for Elderly Wheelchair Users,10095020,R03AG069836,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Economics', 'El Salvador', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Income', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Life Style', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Care', 'Maintenance', 'Manual wheelchair', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Notification', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'User Compliance', 'Wheelchairs', 'aged', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'industry partner', 'low and middle-income countries', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'rural area', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'tool', 'usability', 'vibration']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R03,2020,75877,-0.037397435475426045
"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,9912094,R01AI135115,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladeshi', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholera', 'Cholera Vaccine', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Haiti', 'Haitian', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sanitation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Standardization', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Vibrio cholerae O1', 'Vibrio cholerae infection', 'Water', 'age related', 'base', 'cohort', 'diarrheal disease', 'disorder risk', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,667663,-0.012318087064427309
"Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study Project Summary In the U.S., approximately 840,000 Americans die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) each year. The prevalence of CVD is on the rise and widespread disparities in CVD exist across economic, racial, and ethnic groups. In order to address the rising prevalence of CVD and persistent disparities, there has been a shift in focus to public health strategies addressing cardiovascular health (CVH). CVH is a broader and more positive construct beyond the absence of CVD. Despite this recent focus on improving CVH, widespread disparities still exist. Social determinants of health (SDOH) may be important contributors to these continued disparities. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SDOH as the “structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.” There has been limited work in studying how a diverse set of SDOH change over time and perform in the prediction of CVH. To address this need, we will identify patterns of SDOH exposure over time and determine if the addition of SDOH variables allows for better prediction of an individual's CVH status. The primary hypothesis is that a diverse set of SDOH will be associated with and improve the prediction of CVH, independent of baseline CVH and other covariates. To examine this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) identify patterns of SDOH exposure up to age 50 and define exposure subgroups and 2) determine whether overall and domain-specific patterns of SDOH exposures from young adulthood to middle age, identified in Aim 1, are associated with and improve the prediction of CVH and its component metrics. We will utilize the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective cohort study with detailed information on cardiovascular risk factors and disease in a geographically and racially diverse sample of young adults. In Aim 1, we will use a novel sequential pattern mining method to identify the associations among SDOH and determine the SDOH exposure patterns from baseline to age 50. The Aim 1 SDOH exposure definitions will be included as predictors of CVH at age 50 and beyond using supervised machine learning techniques. By including SDOH in predictive models, health services professionals and clinicians may have an improved understanding of patients at high-risk for low CVH and may better tailor social and clinical interventions to each patient's needs. If awarded, this fellowship will allow me to contribute novel research to the SDOH and cardiovascular health fields, gain competency in new research skills, and improve my writing and presentation skills. The completion of this project and training will prepare me for my long-term career goal of becoming an independent research scientist in an academic setting, studying SDOH and using data science and informatics tools to improve public health. Project Narrative The incorporation of social determinants of health (SDOH) in predictive models for cardiovascular health (CVH) may help health services professionals and clinicians in identifying patients at high-risk for low CVH. This has important public health implications because social and clinical interventions may be tailored to each patient's needs. This research may also help to identify which SDOH are predictive of CVH from young adulthood to middle age, allowing public health professionals to target specific SDOH through directed social, behavioral, and policy-related interventions.",Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study,9911103,F31HL151178,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Social Identification', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'age group', 'base', 'biracial', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'cohort', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'good diet', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial difference', 'racial diversity', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F31,2020,40733,-0.04237729659827124
"Cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of distressing psychotic-like experiences in childhood and adolescence Project Summary Research has yet to understand why some with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs; early markers of psychosis risk) transition to psychosis spectrum disorders whereas others report only transient PLEs. This information will be critical for understanding the etiology of psychosis spectrum symptoms and for prevention and intervention efforts for this major public health concern (~90% of individuals with significant PLEs report mental health diagnoses in adulthood). According to the expanded proneness-persistence-impairment (PPI) model, potential distinguishing factors between transient PLEs and those transitioning to psychotic disorders is whether they are sustained and distressing (i.e., sustained dPLEs). Consistent with NIMH Strategic Objective 2, this K23 application will fill critical missing gaps in the literature by characterizing the key risk factors and clinical significance of early sustained dPLEs. The application will focus on ~11,800 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study initially aged 9-11-years-old followed annually over the course of the award. The analyses will test PPI model hypotheses, including investigating the most important factors distinguishing sustained from transient dPLEs, examining neurobiological correlates (e.g., resting state functional connectivity, cortical thickness, cognitive functioning), family history of psychosis, motor and speech developmental delays, and environmental predictors (adverse childhood experiences, cannabis use; Aim 1). Models will also test whether longitudinal changes in cognitive, neural predictors, and environmental risk factors distinguish sustained versus transient dPLEs (Aim 2). Lastly, the application will also fill a critical research gap by examining the clinical significance of sustained dPLEs, examining the social and educational functional impairments, treatment seeking behavior, and conducting additional data collection when the youth are ages 16 to 18 to assess the base rates of attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) among youth endorsing sustained dPLEs (Aim 3). To assess rates of APS, the applicant and a masters-level clinician will interview a subset of ABCD participants (n=500) and their parents/caregivers using the Structured Interview of Prodromal Syndromes. Overall, the applicant will implement rigorous practices, including running all analyses for the aims and hypotheses outlined below on two-thirds of data and then replicating the exact same models on an untouched one-third of data. Under the mentorship of a diverse team of experts of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology, longitudinal analyses, machine learning, and neuroimaging analyses, this scientifically rigorous proposal will test hypotheses regarding cross- sectional and longitudinal predictors of sustained versus transient dPLEs for the future application of early identification and preventative interventions. The application addresses several gaps in the applicant’s training that are critical for success as an independent clinical investigator, including the need for further training in advanced statistical techniques (e.g., machine learning, longitudinal analyses, neuroimaging analyses) and increased exposure in the area of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The current application will make important advances in understanding the nature of early markers of risk for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, otherwise known as psychotic-like experiences. Specifically, we do not yet understand why some individuals go on to develop more severe forms of psychotic-like experiences (i.e., sustained distressing psychotic-like experiences) and why for some individuals these experiences are transient. The current application will make significant strides in understanding the most important factors (such as family history and cognition) distinguishing sustained from transient distressing psychotic-like experiences, as well as understanding the clinical importance of these symptoms (including how many individuals with sustained distressing psychotic-like experiences seek treatment or have problems in school or at homes as a result of these symptoms).",Cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of distressing psychotic-like experiences in childhood and adolescence,10054751,K23MH121792,"['11 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Occupational', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Sustainable Development', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Youth', 'adverse childhood events', 'aged', 'attenuated psychosis syndrome', 'base', 'career', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'structured data', 'success', 'theories']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,162963,-0.002416383073800812
"Early Mobilization: Operationalizing Big Data & Implementation Science to Lead Expansion to ICUs (E-MOBILE-ICU) PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 800,000 critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation every year and three quarters of the survivors suffer from persistent disability, which poses a major public health problem as critical care becomes more widely utilized and available. Although early mobilization, which engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation, is a promising evidence-based intervention that may prevent disability, less than ten percent of pa- tients ever get out of bed. This proposal aims to apply precision medicine to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early mobilization and elucidate how it can be implemented successfully to extend the benefits of early mobilization to critical care survivors at greatest risk for long-term disability. I hypothesize that this re- source-intensive intervention can be applied with greater precision to a subset of patients most likely to bene- fit, and that implementation science strategies can be devised to successfully drive adoption of this interven- tion beyond a clinical trial setting. I will test my hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) I will identify the optimal critical illness phenotype for implementation of early mobilization by using cutting-edge machine learning methods; Aim 2) I will determine the effect of early mobilization on long-term functional disability to incentivize adoption of this practice; Aim 3) I will determine the barriers and facilitators of implementation of early mobilization across five institutions to identify the contextual features associated with successful implementation to inform strategies that can bridge the gap between evidence base and clinical practice. My long-term goal is to mitigate the com- plications of critical illness with clinical trials using precision-based methods to identify at-risk and yet apt-to- benefit populations paired with implementation science methodologies to illuminate how to bring these interven- tions to the bedside. To accomplish this, I have assembled an exceptional interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. Vineet Arora, Matthew Churpek, and John Kress) and advisors (Drs. Shyam Prabhakaran, Donald Hedeker, Laura Damschroder, and Matthias Eikermann) who have a track record of NIH-funding and successful mentor- ship of post-doctoral candidates. I intend to build on my foundation as an accomplished clinical trialist and have formulated an in-depth career development plan to gain expertise in machine learning methods to identify differ- ential treatment effects (Churpek and Prabhakaran), longitudinal data analysis, (Arora and Hedeker), and imple- mentation science methods (Arora, Prabhakaran, and Damschroder) to craft strategies that bring complex mul- tidisciplinary interventions from clinical trials (Kress and Eikermann) to everyday ICU care. Completion of this proposal will train me to fill an unmet need defined by a recent National Academy of Medicine publication which indicated that identification of differential treatment effects must be paired with rigorous implementation to help transition evidence base to routine clinical care. Equipped with advanced statistical skills and implementation science approaches, I will be able to design hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to target and implement complex multidisciplinary interventions to vulnerable populations in future R01 level applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Three-quarters of survivors of mechanical ventilation will develop persistent disability. Early mobilization engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation to prevent disability, but has poor adoption into clinical practice.

"Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. Over 5.4 million cases of keratinocyte cancers (basal and squamous cell) are diagnosed annually and incidence of melanoma has increased 3% each year for the past 30 years. In the 2014 Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer, the U. S. Surgeon General included strategies for coordinating messages on sun safety and physical activity, recognizing the need for sun safety among populations that engage in physical activity outdoors. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer; individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn. Melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Strava, a tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of mobile technologies for logging physical activity and providing social feedback on activities by other Strava users. The goal of this R21 research is to test the feasibility of interfacing with the Strava website and its mobile app to develop an algorithm that a) predicts when individuals are likely to be engaged in physical activity outdoors in the sun when ultraviolet radiation is high and b) delivers sun safety advice tailored to the time, location, and personal risk (e.g., skin sun sensitivity) of the Strava users. Concept focus groups with Strava users (n=16) and non-users (n=16) will provide input on the feasibility, content, and functions in the Strava Sun (SS) intervention. The algorithm that predicts future outdoor exercise will be developed using machine learning modeling on activity data provided by Strava users (n=1000). The SS intervention will be programmed to deliver ecologically-valid sun safety advice through Strava's open-source Applications Programming Interface (API) via email and comments in the Strava interface. The sun safety advice will be tailored to location, time, season and user's personal risk, employing advice algorithms we developed for a sun safety mobile app, sunZapp, and a social media message library in our Go Sun Smart intervention for outdoor recreation resorts. SS will be tested for usability (n=30 Strava users) prior to conducting a pilot field trial to establish feasibility of SS in practice (n=226 Strava users). The project is significant and innovative. A sun protection interface for the Strava platform will provide individuals who engage in regular physical activity personalized, ecologically-valid advice to help them practice sun safety during outdoor activities. It will contain a novel machine learning algorithm that predicts future high-risk behavior, i.e., outdoor physical activity, to provide precision prevention advice. The intervention will be delivered over an established and popular technology platform with over 42 million registered users. Recreational UV exposure is associated with every form of skin cancer and individuals who engage in more physical activity have a higher prevalence of sunburn, a proximal biomarker of melanoma risk, perhaps explaining why melanoma is the only cancer with which physical activity is positively correlated. Mobile technology for tracking physical activity has become increasingly prevalent and Strava, an activity tracking app and social networking site for athletes, is one of the most popular of these technologies. This research will test the feasibility of delivering location-based, ecologically-valid sun safety advice to Strava users at times when they are predicted to be engaged in outdoor physical activity, by utilizing Strava's public open-source Applications Programming Interface.",Using Retrospective and Real-Time Physical Activity Tracking to Predict Risk of Sunburn in Outdoor Exercisers on Strava,10057198,R21CA241637,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Basal Cell', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cancer Control', 'Cessation of life', 'Colorado', 'Connecticut', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Electronic Mail', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'High Prevalence', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Photosensitivity', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protective Clothing', 'Published Comment', 'Recreation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Self Efficacy', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Social Network', 'Software Engineering', 'Squamous Cell', 'Sun Exposure', 'Sunburn', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'United States', 'anticancer research', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'data access', 'data format', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'forgetting', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'interest', 'keratinocyte', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'melanoma biomarkers', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety practice', 'skill acquisition', 'skin cancer prevention', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'sun protection', 'sun safety', 'usability', 'web site', 'willingness']",NCI,"KLEIN BUENDEL, INC.",R21,2020,444313,-0.006326570739786901
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,10074037,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,18249,-0.0014973929736269013
"The Impact of Temperature and Pollution on Mortality, Morbidity, and Health Care Cost Among the Elderly OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Determinants of Vulnerability to Environmental Stress Among the Elderly ADRD Population As individuals live longer, healthier lives, the number of people living with, and dying from, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has risen. AD prevalence and mortality are expected to continue to rise in the future. However, while AD is fatal and individuals living with AD have high mortality rates, their immediate cause of death is usually respiratory disease or ischemic heart disease rather than dementia. Consequently, improving the health and quality of life of people living with ADRD depends on understanding their vulnerability to these diseases, and how these conditions interact with their dementia. Our proposed study focuses on the determinants of health and mortality among those in the Medicare population who have been identified as living with ADRD. Because cardiovascular and respiratory diseases have been identified as frequent causes of death among the ADRD population, we focus on an environmental stressor that increases the likelihood of death due to cardiovascular and respiratory causes: acute exposure to air pollution. Using a large dataset of Medicare beneficiaries and machine-learning techniques applied to quasi-random variation in pollution exposure generated by changes in local wind direction, we find that acute exposure to air pollution increases mortality risk for only about one quarter of the elderly. While individuals living with ADRD are much more likely to be in this vulnerable group than the typical Medicare beneficiary, we find that acute air pollution exposure does not increase mortality risk for a large fraction (44%) of Medicare beneficiaries living with ADRD. In this study, we will apply machine learning and “big data” techniques to Medicare administrative data, local characteristics, and atmospheric variables in order to understand why some individuals living with ADRD suffer harm from the increased cardiovascular and respiratory stress induced by air pollution exposure while others do not. These factors, once identified and verified in continuing research, will provide guidance that can improve the health and quality of life of individuals living with ADRD by better directing resources to those most in need and guiding interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability to these and other hazards. As part of the project, we will develop a publicly available database that provides the following data at the ZIP code level: ADRD prevalence, vulnerability to air pollution exposure among the ADRD population, and ZIP code level characteristics that have been shown to affect vulnerability. Other researchers can then use this data for any other study seeking to understand the effects of geographically defined factors or policies on the ADRD population. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative While Alzheimer’s disease is a fatal form of dementia, the top two immediate causes of death for people with Alzheimer’s disease are respiratory illness (55.5%) and ischemic heart disease (23.1%), which are both exacerbated by exposure to environmental hazards such as air pollution. In this study, we will apply machine learning and “big data” techniques to Medicare administrative data in order to identify risk factors that predict vulnerability to the harmful effects of pollution exposure for individuals living with ADRD, allowing for better targeting of resources to those most in need and contributing to the improvement of interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability to these and other hazards.","The Impact of Temperature and Pollution on Mortality, Morbidity, and Health Care Cost Among the Elderly",10123225,R01AG053350,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Big Data', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Environmental Wind', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Policies', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'beneficiary', 'environmental stressor', 'hazard', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'respiratory']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,R01,2020,376508,-0.0787189093741987
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents.

"Exploring the role of gonadotropins in Down syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Down syndrome (DS) is a common chromosomal disorder that results from the triplication of chromosome 21. Comorbid medical conditions frequently occur among individuals with DS; however, opthalamic disorders such as keratoconus occurs 6 times more often among this population as compared to the general population. Keratoconus is a known multifactorial, progressive, degenerative disease of the cornea; however, the etiology of the disease remains unclear. Our recent work has found that hormone-regulated Prolactin-Induced Protein (PIP) is a potential biomarker of keratoconus but the link between DS and keratoconus remains unclear. Pathway analysis has further linked comorbid DS and keratoconus through gonadotropins and serum amyloid A1 (SAA), a protein linked in a series of studies to cognitive dysfunction among adults with DS. The proposed study aims to determine and validate the role of gonadotropins in the DS population with the keratoconus co-morbidity with the long-term goal to better understand the underlying mechanisms that result in increased risk for ocular co-morbidities such as keratoconus among this population. This pilot study will include n=90 participants (n=30 DS; n=30 comorbid DS and Keratoconus; n=30 healthy controls). All participants will provide biofluid samples of tears and plasma, which will be assayed on an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) platform. Analyses will be performed using R and SPSS 24 (IBM) in a series of steps. Support Vector Machine (SVM) analyses will be applied to examine the use of biomarkers to detect disease presence (i.e. keratoconus comorbidity). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses will help with variable selection in order to enhance the prediction accuracy of the models. Biomarkers will include hormone specific (LSH, LH, GNRH, LHR, FSHR, GNRHR) as well as a panel of plasma proteins including biomarkers of inflammation linked with cognitive dysfunction (SAA, CRP, ICAM1, VCAM1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-5, IL-7, Eotaxin-3, TARC, A2M, B2M, FVII, TNC, Adiponectin, FABP-3, IL-18, PPY, TPO and I-309). Diagnosis of keratoconus will be utilized as the dependent variable. If successful, data obtained from this study could help facility the development of a screening tool for detecting individuals with DS who are at risk for development of keratoconus, with the goal of defining potential enrollment into clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Vision disorders occur in nearly all individuals with Down syndrome (DS) with development of ocular co-morbidities such as keratoconus, a cornea dystrophy, occurring 6 times more often in this population as compared to the general population. Recent work from our group has found differences in sex hormones (i.e. androgen and estrogen levels) among individuals with keratoconus as compared to healthy controls but this difference was impacted by age and gender. Information gained from this study will (1) reveal the relationship between gonadotropins among individuals with DS and ocular comorbidities, specifically keratoconus, and (2) provide insight into the association between known plasma biomarkers including serum amyloid A1 and gonadotrophins among those with DS as well as those with comorbid keratoconus and DS.",Exploring the role of gonadotropins in Down syndrome,10108508,R21EY032320,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Androgens', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blepharitis', 'Blood', 'CCL1 gene', 'CCL17 gene', 'CCL26 gene', 'Cataract', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome 21', 'Clinical Trials', 'Congenital chromosomal disease', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Corneal dystrophy', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Eye Development', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Future', 'GNRH1 gene', 'GNRH2 gene', 'GNRHR gene', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Hormones', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Gonadotropins', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'ICAM1 gene', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-18', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukin-7', 'Keratoconus', 'Lacrimal Duct Obstruction', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic Nystagmus', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prolactin', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Readiness', 'Refractive Errors', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Strabismus', 'TNF gene', 'Thinness', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visual Acuity', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'insight', 'link protein', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'programs', 'receptor', 'sex', 'support vector machine']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,403584,-0.010508254604054154
"Evaluating associations between trauma-related characteristics and functional recovery in individuals with spinal cord injury Project Summary World Health Organization established that every year, around the world, between 250,000 and 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI). While existing research suggests links between the injury event, early care, and rehabilitation outcomes, there still remains a critical knowledge gap – about how characteristics associated with trauma and acute phases of SCI can allow us to better understand functional recovery post- SCI. In the past, this research was partly hampered due to databases that either focused on trauma-care or inpatient rehabilitation. However, using advanced analytical methods, we are now in a position to combine databases that contain trauma and acute phase-related variables with patient-level characteristics to assess longitudinal functional recovery over time. Trauma and acute phase-related variables include type of trauma, cause of injury, process of care, clinical data, and outcome data during acute care. The overall objective of this study is to use trauma and acute phase-related variables to explain the longitudinal functional recovery of individuals with SCI, from acute to post-acute to community. This will be achieved by probabilistically linking the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Outcomes Study (PTOS) database with the National Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems (SCIMS) database. The PTOS and SCIMS databases provide complimentary information about trauma and acute phases of SCI from acute hospital to inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) to community. The long-term goal of our research is to identify trauma and acute phase-related variables that can be utilized during acute care and post-acute rehabilitation interventions to improve clinical decision making, which in turn enhances rehabilitation programs.The central hypothesis of this proposal is that trauma and acute phase- related variables, combined with patient-level characteristics, will significantly predict longitudinal functional recovery in individuals post-SCI. Our hypothesis is guided by prior research and our pilot work with the PTOS database. A primary objective of this proposal is to examine the association between trauma and acute phase- related variables with functional improvements during IRF in individuals with traumatic SCI using machine learning ensemble methods (Aim 1). A secondary objective of this study is to develop longitudinal trajectories of functional recovery over a period of 1-year post-SCI taking into account trauma, acute phase, and patient- level characteristics during acute, post-acute, and community living using growth curve modelling (Aim 2). The proposed study will yield novel insights about the relationship between trauma and acute phase-related variables with functional status. Project Narrative World Health Organization has reported that every year, around the world, between 250,000 and 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI).

"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9912764,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2020,139614,0.0061643922574316475
"Modified Use of E-cigarettes and Marketing on YouTube PROJECT SUMMARY E-cigarette use among U.S. youth is a significant public health problem. Understanding youth appeal of e- cigarettes and marketing strategies targeting youth is critical to inform the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s goal to prevent youth e-cigarette use. A significant youth appeal is the ability to modify e-cigarettes or to “hack” the devices or e-liquid constituents for unintended purposes (e.g., using at higher temperatures or for a longer period of time, adding their own e-liquids made with nicotine or THC oil). However, it is largely unknown how youth modify e-cigarette devices or their components, their perceptions of these behaviors, and marketing strategies used to endorse these behaviors. YouTube, a popular social media, can be examined to understand modified uses of e-cigarettes and marketing associated with these behaviors. The overall goal of this study is to understand ways in which youth modify e-cigarettes, their motivations for doing so, and marketing sources, using YouTube analysis, survey methodology, and expert evaluation. We will identify modified uses of e-cigarettes and marketing using fictitious youth YouTube viewer profiles to search for e-cigarettes using a browser plug-in and custom scripted web-crawling and then machine learning to automatically code the videos to identify e-cigarette modifications and marketing source. Our Advisory Committee (AC) of subject matter experts in tobacco regulatory science, social media, youth tobacco use, toxicology, communications, and tobacco marketing will apply their knowledge to assess the potential impact of these identified modified uses on appeal, addiction, and health effects of e-cigarettes to identify those which are amenable to FDA regulations and communications. We will then conduct an in-depth analysis of these selected behaviors using a combination of machine learning and detailed human coding on youth-accessible YouTube videos to understand: 1) components that are modified (e.g., batteries, cartridges/pods, e-liquids), 2) motivations for modification (e.g., enhance user experience, reduce perceived harm), 3) marketing sources (e.g., online shops, pro-e-cigarette organizations), and 4) appeal (number of likes, views). We will also use an online survey with adolescent and young adult e-cigarette users (N=1000) to examine the prevalence, appeal, motivations, risk perceptions, and marketing exposure related to these modified uses and their predictors (i.e., demographic variables, past-month e-cigarette use frequency, e-cigarette dependence, other tobacco/substance use, interpersonal and intrapersonal risk factors). The results of this study will provide the FDA with novel evidence to 1) develop regulations to prohibit the manufacturing and marketing of e-cigarette components that can be modified by youth, 2) restrict youth-accessible marketing of e-cigarettes on social media such as YouTube, and 3) develop prevention campaigns to educate youth about the harms of modifying e-cigarettes. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: E-cigarette use among youth is high; thus, to inform youth e-cigarette prevention, we will examine the youth appeal of the product, such as the ability to modify or “hack” the devices and their related components for unintended uses and marketing on popular social media, YouTube. We will use mixed-methods (i.e., machine learning, survey methodology, expert evaluation) to achieve our aim. The results of this study will provide the FDA with novel evidence to develop regulations to prohibit the manufacturing and marketing of e-cigarette components that can be modified, restrict youth-accessible marketing of e-cigarettes on YouTube, and develop prevention campaigns to educate youth about the harms of engaging in these behaviors.",Modified Use of E-cigarettes and Marketing on YouTube,9981285,R01DA049878,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Behavior', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Devices', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Esthesia', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High temperature of physical object', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Industry', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Motivation', 'Nicotine', 'Oils', 'Perception', 'Plug-in', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Toxicology', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'demographics', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic liquid', 'experience', 'male', 'marijuana vaping', 'novel', 'preference', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk perception', 'sex', 'social', 'social media', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco regulatory science', 'vaping', 'web site']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,453703,-0.022488340178539828
"In Vivo Knee Motion and ACL Biomechanics During Dynamic Activities Abstract: Radiographic evidence of OA is present in more than 50% of patients 10 years after ACL reconstruction. However, the etiology of early onset OA after ACL reconstruction is not well understood. While previous work has demonstrated changes in joint motion following reconstruction, it is unclear how these altered motions relate to changes in the local mechanical response of cartilage to in vivo loading. This information may be critical to understanding the onset of OA, as the mechanical response of cartilage affects cartilage homeostasis. In line with this mechanism, our pilot data indicates that regions of high cartilage strain measured in patients with ACL injury and reconstruction are susceptible to decreased cartilage thickness, a characteristic feature of OA. Importantly, these degenerative changes are observed as early as 18 months post-reconstruction. Therefore, in this proposal our overall hypothesis is that site-specific changes in the mechanical response of cartilage to loading following ACL injury and reconstruction are predictive of long-term cartilage degeneration. Specifically, we hypothesize that in regions of cartilage experiencing elevated strain during loading, early degeneration will be reflected by altered composition and decreased cartilage thickness. Thus, we will measure localized cartilage strain, composition, and thickness at four time-points: after ACL injury but prior to reconstruction, as well as at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. At each time point, a combination of high-speed biplanar radiography and MR imaging will be used to measure local cartilage strains during in vivo loading. To assess cartilage degeneration, we will use MRI to measure site-specific changes in composition (using T1rho and T2 relaxation times) and cartilage thickness. Additionally, our analyses will account for relevant biological variables such as age, sex, and BMI, and clinical factors such as graft placement characteristics and meniscus injuries. In addition to mechanical factors, biological factors such as joint inflammation and lubrication may also play a role in cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, synovial fluid and serum will be collected to measure inflammatory mediators and metabolic biomarkers. Using this data, we will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction that utilizes both mechanical and biological factors, as well as other demographic and clinical characteristics, to predict declines in cartilage health. Furthermore, this comprehensive dataset will be used to develop clinical phenotypes to identify those at high risk for cartilage degradation after ACL reconstruction. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focusing on surgical procedures, pharmaceutical targets, and non- pharmacological interventions such as physical therapy or weight loss in preventing cartilage degeneration. Therefore, our findings will both elucidate the role of alterations in the local mechanical response of cartilage on degeneration after ACL reconstruction and improve the identification and treatment of patients at high risk for cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) is a major concern after ACL reconstruction. This project will develop a predictive model of cartilage degeneration after ACL reconstruction using a novel combination of mechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics.

"Maternal Antecedents and Electronic Fetal Monitoring in Term Asphyxia (MAESTRA) Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a neurologic syndrome that results from reduced flow of oxygenated blood to the fetal or newborn brain. HIE occurs in 1-3 per 1,000 term births and may cause death or neurologic disabilities such as cerebral palsy. Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) was developed in the 1970's to assess the adequacy of fetal oxygenation as a strategy to prevent HIE, and is now standard of care. Yet clinical trials report that EFM usage has not reduced the rate of CP, perinatal death or HIE, but is associated with a dramatic increase in cesarean deliveries. The currently used 3 Category fetal heart rate (FHR) classification system, based on simple rules designed to be easy to apply at the bedside, has some utility in predicting HIE. However, Category II FHR patterns that make up the vast majority of tracings are poorly predictive of HIE and confer “indeterminate” risk. Category III patterns are also of limited use in predicting HIE due to low sensitivity. There is an urgent need to develop better objective methods to assess EFM that would identify more fetuses at risk of HIE in time for corrective actions. Uterine tachysystole, or excessive frequency of uterine contractions, has been implicated as a preventable cause of HIE; yet studies report conflicting results. EFM research has been limited by an inability to access and manually analyze the large datasets needed to study HIE. We now have the ability to analyze digital EFM signals using automated methods to measure standard FHR patterns as well as to discover novel aspects of the tracing that may not be readily detectable by a clinician at the bedside. We hypothesize that modern signal processing and machine learning techniques can create highly predictive models of HIE by analyzing established and novel features of EFM tracings, in combination with demographic and pertinent clinical information from the mother and fetus. We propose a population-based retrospective cohort study of 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2010-19. Our specific aims are: 1) To create the MAESTRA Cohort dataset that links EFM recordings to HIE and neonatal acidosis among 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation in 2010-19 at Kaiser Permanente Northern CA; 2) Using modern signal processing and machine learning techniques, to extract established and novel FHR and uterine contractility features from the EFM recordings, and to determine which of these features are most predictive of HIE and acidosis when combined with maternal and fetal clinical data; and 3) To perform external validation by applying the final predictive models to a historical dataset. We anticipate that machine learning techniques incorporating novel FHR and uterine contractility patterns over time, as well as pre- and perinatal clinical characteristics, will improve the predictive value of the EFM data that are already being collected as part of routine care. Our results will inform future clinical trials. Such an unprecedented large-scale multidisciplinary study will lead to improvements in our ability to use EFM data to prevent neonatal brain injury while minimizing unnecessary cesarean sections. MAESTRA Project Narrative Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs when a baby gets reduced oxygen and blood flow to the brain, and can lead to death or long-term disabilities such as cerebral palsy. During labor and delivery, doctors are able to continuously record the heart rate of the fetus.

"Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses and Predicting Medication-Class Response in Patients Project Summary/Abstract  Mood disorders, like many psychiatric conditions, have their onset in emerging adulthood and often last a lifetime. Mental illnesses have an excessively large loading of Disability Adjusted Life Years, making early intervention crucial for both individuals and society. Differentiating bipolar disorder (BD) from major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) can be especially challenging if clear mania is absent. In fact, BD patients go an average of 6-10 years without the proper diagnosis, with 70% misdiagnosed with MDD instead. The challenge of identifying BD patients among depressed individuals is complex but critical because diagnosis determines treatment. The use of antidepressant (AD) medications in patients with BD can lead to worsening of illness. We have recently shown that, using resting fMRI, we can predict future medication class response with high accuracy (> 90%). In this project we will build on this work to generalize to a new MRI scanner and clinical assessment protocol. In addition we will develop, in consultation with multiple psychiatrists, a cloud-based tool to analyze and report the results from the brain imaging protocol and machine learning analysis, in a timely, meaningful, and interpretable manner. Results are expected to be an important step forward in the eventual development of clinical useful markers of mental illness. 2 Project Narrative  Patients with mood disorders will often spend months to years on the wrong medication, which can also make them worse (e.g., putting individuals with bipolar disorder on antidepressants). There is a great need to develop biomarkers of treatment response in mental illness. This work will build on recent work from our group showing over 90% accuracy using resting fMRI predictors to further generalize the results to multiple scanners and develop an online portal to process and provide reporting of results (classification results) as well as processed data and citation information.",Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses and Predicting Medication-Class Response in Patients,10157747,R41MH122201,"['Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Combination Medication', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Financial cost', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'New Mexico', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Ontario', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatrist', 'Readiness', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data sharing', 'data tools', 'data warehouse', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adulthood', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'quality assurance', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'web portal']",NIMH,ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS GROUP,R41,2020,437555,-0.030474457597901593
"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning. PROJECT NARRATIVE Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype that provides important information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. This study utilizes a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach coupled with longitudinal multimodal MR imaging and neurocognitive assessment in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry and cognition along a continuum from healthy controls to SPD (in the SZ spectrum but not fully psychotic) to SZ (psychosis).

"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,9709107,R01HD092331,"['Academia', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Crime', 'Criminology', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Family', 'Firearms', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Security', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'behavioral outcome', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'convict', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'developmental psychology', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'repeat offender', 'social', 'social factors', 'structured data', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2020,706182,-0.005300488734580428
"Personalized Networks and Sensor Technology Algorithms of Eating Disorder Symptoms Predicting Eating Disorder Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are severe mental illnesses with the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. The most widely used empirically supported treatment for EDs (cognitive behavior therapy) is only efficacious for ~50% of individuals. This low response rate is due to the fact that EDs are heterogeneous conditions with diverse symptom trajectories that are not adequately addressed in current “one-size-fits-all” psychotherapies. Until we can identify what maintains or exacerbates individual symptoms, clinicians will continue to have difficulty accurately predicting prognosis and will have no empirical guidance to develop targeted treatment plans to promote recovery. Our scientific premise, developed from our past work, is that the application of network theory will enable the identification of cognitive-behavioral symptom networks that maintain and ‘trigger’ EDs both between and within individuals. Our study goals are to (1) identify individual ED ‘trigger’ symptoms (cognitions, behaviors, affect, and physiology) and (2) correlate trigger symptoms with real-time physiological data to create an algorithm predicting onset of ED behaviors. These goals will ultimately identify symptoms that prevent full remission and lead to relapse. We will use a multiple units of analysis approach combined with novel, cutting-edge advances in network science. We will collect intensive real- time data on cognitions, behavior, affect, and physiology using mobile and sensor-technology from 120 individuals with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN), atypical AN, and bulimia nervosa across 30 days. At 1-month and 6-month follow ups we will assess ED outcomes (e.g., remission status, ED behaviors) to test if ‘trigger’ symptoms predict ED outcomes. Network science and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques will allow us, for the first time, to discover whether certain trigger symptoms predict worse outcomes. Specific aims are to (1) develop personalized networks to identify which cognitive, behavioral, affective, and physiological symptoms maintain EDs and predict ED outcomes and (2) utilize sensor data to identify physiological patterns both within and across people that correlate with core maintaining symptoms and that predict ED behaviors. The proposed research uses highly innovative methods, combining intensive longitudinal data collection methods, all remote procedures, novel advances in network science and sensor-technology, and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to answer previously unresolvable questions pinpointing which personalized symptoms trigger EDs. The proposed research has clinical impact. If we identify patterns that contribute to symptom network variation within individuals, these data will provide a model of personalized medicine for the entire field of psychiatry, as well as providing novel intervention targets to prevent and treat EDs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will identify the maintaining symptoms of eating disorders within individuals. The proposed research has significant public health relevance, as it will lead to personalized, novel, effective treatments that promote full remission and decrease the high societal burden associated with eating disorders. The proposed research is relevant to NIH’s precision medicine initiative, as it will identify within-person, maintenance symptoms of eating disorders, leading to personalized treatments delivered via mobile or sensor technology.",Personalized Networks and Sensor Technology Algorithms of Eating Disorder Symptoms Predicting Eating Disorder Outcomes,10044077,R15MH121445,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Binge Eating', 'Bulimia', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Eating Disorders', 'Epilepsy', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Science', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'food restriction', 'innovation', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'severe mental illness', 'smartphone Application', 'standard care', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'treatment planning', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R15,2020,463165,-0.025557340815378107
"2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML historical analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and predicators;Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk,9978241,R01MH120088,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,377685,-0.009393217051249124

"4/5 CAPER: Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods.

"Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies. Abstract Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions (increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels) that occur together, increasing risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Epidemiological studies have shown that prolonged sitting is deleterious to metabolic indicators, even after adjusting for physical activity (PA). Acute laboratory trials have shown that breaking up sitting time can improve metabolic factors. Sitting is a prevalent behavior in all population groups by age, gender and ethnicity. Associations with metabolic syndrome factors, such as obesity, have also been shown in all population groups. Epidemiological studies have mostly depended on reported sitting time, especially TV reviewing. More recently large cohort studies have collected data from hip worn accelerometers and applied a cut point (e.g., 100 counts per minute) on single axis data to estimate sedentary time. Such devices have been included in numerous studies, principally because of their accuracy to measure PA intensity. Primarily used in intervention trials to reduce sitting, the thigh worn ActivPAL has been shown to more accurately assess posture and provide valid measures of sitting, standing, and sit-stand transitions. To date, very few health outcome cohort studies have included the ActivPAL. Compared to the ActivPAL and free living observations of sitting time, the 100 count cut point has been shown to underestimate prolonged sitting by substantially overestimating sit-stand transitions. New studies are showing that how we accumulate sitting time (i.e. in long or short bouts) is associated with metabolic health outcomes, and may be independent of total sitting time and PA. Study results on prolonged sitting and metabolic risk factors from accelerometer data are inconsistent and may be due to measurement error in the cut points employed. In a small sample of older women, adults, and youth we have demonstrated that novel machine learned methods can greatly improve estimates of prolonged sitting and transitions. Further development and testing of these methods would support valid applications to existing large cohort studies with raw accelerometer data to improve estimates of associations between sitting patterns and metabolic health. There are also many large cohorts (e.g. NHANES 2003/6), with quality health outcomes, but non raw accelerometer count data, so calibration methods to adjust non raw estimates of sitting time are also needed and would be attractive to researchers not yet familiar with the machine learning process. We proposed to employ 7 existing data sets (N=20,000) matched for age and spanning youth, adults and older adults. We will scale up our training and test the performance of the refined algorithms to detect sit-stand frequencies, prolonged sitting, usual bout duration and Alpha (a combination of duration & frequency). We will test performance of the algorithms against ActivPAL (ground truth) and in new samples assess predictive validity with objective health outcomes. We will test differences between the existing and new techniques using R2 and mean-squared error of prediction (via bootstrapping) and GEE techniques. Narrative There are many large studies with existing data that could be better used to understand health behaviors. We will focus on improving measurement of sitting patterns from body worn devices. We will see how sitting is related to obesity and other metabolic risk factors for chronic disease across different age groups.",Novel computational techniques to detect the relationship between sitting patterns and metabolic syndrome in existing cohort studies.,10003222,R01DK114945,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Patterning', 'Body fat', 'Calibration', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hip region structure', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Population Group', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age group', 'algorithm training', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'heart disease risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'older women', 'performance tests', 'response', 'scale up', 'sedentary', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,640068,-0.04701747759028169

"Parsing Neurobiological Bases of Heterogeneity in ADHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with multifactorial etiological risk factors, diverse expressions of symptoms, comorbidities, and long-term trajectories. An approach to parsing such heterogeneity is to move beyond symptom ratings toward clinically meaningful phenotypic measures that have well-theorized relations with neurobiological systems. This approach serves as the basis of the NIH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. In the proposed study, we will explore attention in an attempt to understand heterogeneity within children with ADHD. Reaction time variability (RTV), an index of attention, is the cognitive correlate that typically demonstrates the largest effect size when comparing ADHD to non-ADHD children. However, while RTV is considered a robust correlate of ADHD, its etiology is unclear and individuals with ADHD themselves vary considerably on indices of RTV. Thus, first establishing the neurobiological basis for RTV and then exploring if it can be used to understand heterogeneity in ADHD is critical. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine disordered attention, as indicated by RTV, in a large sample of children recruited at ages 9 to 10 and followed longitudinally. ABCD measures include attentional tasks, diagnostic interviews, and extensive neuroimaging. At baseline, 1079 children in ABCD met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. We propose to utilize machine learning to explore the neurobiological basis of RTV using the entire ABCD neuroimaging sample (n=9,598). We will also explore heterogeneity within ADHD by identifying groups of individuals diagnosed with ADHD who are characterized by unique RTV and neuroimaging profiles. To establish the validity of these profiles, we will examine their association with functioning. Machine learning focuses on learning statistical functions from multidimensional data sets to make generalizable predictions about individuals; it allows for inferences at the level of the individual and is sensitive to subtly distributed differences. Thus, it is an ideal approach for deriving subject-level biomarkers. The first aim is to determine which neuroimaging data are associated with each reaction time variable derived from Gaussian, ex-Gaussian, and drift diffusion models. The second aim is to explore corresponding developmental trends in RTV and neuroimaging data. The third aim is to a) identify groups of ADHD subjects with similar attentional profiles and, b) explore the neurobiological signature of these attentional profiles using the data we derived in aim 1. The fourth aim is to examine the clinical correlates of empirically-determined attentional profiles. Conceivably, identifying mechanistic biomarkers of disordered attention reflected by RTV could refine pharmacological, cognitive, and behavioral interventions; this could lead to a higher probability of success for treatments directed toward that particular mechanism for individuals within specific ADHD subgroups. This work could also be relevant for disordered attention in other disorders characterized by high levels of RTV (e.g., Autism). PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric disorders pose challenges to neurobiological analysis as they are complex, routinely co-occur, and are operationalized using behavioral symptoms. We propose to examine the neurobiological basis of reaction time variability in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study in order to explore heterogeneity in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",10019477,R01CA227122,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Breast', 'Cause of Death', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leisures', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Longevity', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'adjudicate', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sex', 'vigorous intensity', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,200000,-0.04384208585406599
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis Dr. Hwanhee Hong is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development. Dr. Hong will also use all available resources from other Departments including biostatistics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. This environment maximizes the potential for Dr. Hong to obtain the necessary training and perform the research to establish herself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program. This project will help mental health researchers generalize, apply, and implement findings from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials to target populations. Traditional meta-analyses enable us to borrow strength across multiple studies to gain more power, resulting in reliable and precise effect estimates; however they do not consider how well the trials represent target populations of interest. By developing methods to help generalize the results of meta-analyses, we will help translate results into appropriate decisions regarding broad implementation and clinical practice.",Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis,9935960,R00MH111807,"['Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data access', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'informal learning', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open data', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'randomized controlled design', 'randomized trial', 'regression trees', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'working group']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,248999,-0.03144619583407776
"CBTpro: Scaling up CBT for psychosis using simulated patients and spoken language technologies Psychosis resulting from schizophrenia spectrum disorders and major mood disorders is one of the most disabling health concerns worldwide. Evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended as standard of care by national psychosis treatment guidelines but are rarely accessible. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is the most well-researched psychotherapy for psychotic disorders, yet fewer than 1% of American mental health providers are trained in this intervention. To date, there has been no scalable way to offer high-quality and sustainable CBTp training to mental health providers. The primary objective of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) proposal is to develop and evaluate a spoken language technology tool – CBTpro -- to support high-quality skills training in CBTp. CBTpro will provide a rapid means of scaling and sustaining CBTp in routine care settings across the US, resulting in more clinicians across the country providing higher quality CBTp to individuals with psychosis. This fast-track STTR proposal has two phases. The objective of Phase I is to develop a CBTpro prototype, which requires three core activities: Aim 1: understand community stakeholder needs to inform software design and functionality; Aim 2: develop CBTpro digital content; and Aim 3: train and validate machine learning algorithms to automatically score CBTp fidelity. The objective of Phase II is to optimize and test the CBTpro tool in real world practice settings. Accordingly, in Phase II, we will Aim 1: conduct a lab usability study (Aim 1a) followed by field testing of the CBTpro prototype (Aim 1b) with 20 trainees; Aim 2: conduct a randomized controlled trial of CBTpro training vs. training as usual (N= 100 providers / N=300 clients), using a nested mixed model analysis to determine the effect of CBTpro on client symptoms, functioning, and recovery; and Aim 3: adopting an NIMH experimental therapeutics approach, assess the hypothesized mechanism by which CBTpro affects clinical outcomes through increased provider fidelity to CBTp (mediation), and test whether the strength of the relationship between these variables is affected by client skill acquisition (moderation). This proposal directly addresses the National Institute of Mental Health’s strategic objectives to improve dissemination, implementation, and continuous improvement of evidence-based mental health services (Objective 4.2) and develop innovative models to dramatically improve the outcomes of mental health services received (Objective 4.3), particularly through the use of novel technology. CBTpro has the potential to reduce the high personal and societal costs associated with serious mental illness, redress the challenges of training amidst high rates of mental health system turnover, support supervisors in quality assurance and improvement efforts, and reduce health disparities associated with mental health workforce shortage areas. Evidence based psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended by national psychosis treatment guidelines, but are inaccessible in routine practice. The objective of this proposal is to systematically develop, pilot, and rigorously test CBTpro, a novel clinician support tool designed to train community mental health workers to provide cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis skills to their clients. CBTpro merges cutting- edge technology with best psychotherapeutic practices for serious mental illness to enable a rapid research, development, and testing pipeline.",CBTpro: Scaling up CBT for psychosis using simulated patients and spoken language technologies,10004543,R42MH123215,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Provider', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Design', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Workforce Development', 'arm', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'cognitive benefits', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'field study', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'practice setting', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'quality assurance', 'rehearsal', 'repository', 'research and development', 'response', 'routine care', 'routine practice', 'scale up', 'severe mental illness', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'societal costs', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines', 'usability', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIMH,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R42,2020,498562,-0.012423615029375019
"Neighborhood Looking Glass: 360 Degree Automated Characterization of the Built Environment for Neighborhood Effects Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal represents a vertical advancement in neighborhood effects research, producing for the first time, national neighborhood indicators of the built environment. Thus far, only local studies have been conducted due to the resource-intensive nature of site visits to conduct assessments of community features and also manual annotations of street images. With the recent advancement of computer vision and the emergence of massive sources of image data, we will leverage our team’s abilities to develop a data collection strategy utilizing geographic information systems to assemble a national collection of Google Street View images of all road intersections and street segments in the United States. We will utilize this data bank, and develop informatics algorithms to produce neighborhood summaries of built environment that have been theoretically and empirically identified to be important for health outcomes. After the creation of Neighborhood Looking Glass, we will conduct investigations into the impact of neighborhood environments on health utilizing medical records from hundreds of thousands of patients and accounting for predisposing characteristics in analyses. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, computer vision, bioinformatics, and computer science—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Develop informatics techniques to produce neighborhood quality indicators; 2) Measure the accuracy of data algorithms and construct an interactive geoportal for neighborhood data visualization and data sharing, 3) Utilize Neighborhood Looking Glass and a large collection of medical records from Intermountain Healthcare to investigate neighborhood influences on the risk of obesity and substance abuse. The epidemic rise in chronic health conditions is recent and as such suggests its cause is social, cultural, and constructed rather than purely biological. Thus, we have the possibility of intervening on the environment to better support health. Recent studies suggest that the current cohort of young adults may face historically high cardiovascular disease risk and chronic disease burden. Our substantive investigation of the impact of neighborhood factors on chronic conditions will contribute further to the understanding of contextual influences on the health of this cohort at the forefront of a chronic disease epidemic. Moreover, the dramatic rise in overdoses, accidental poisonings, and mental health issues contributing to premature mortality warrants further investigation into risk-inducing environmental factors for substance abuse. Neighborhood Looking Glass will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of street image data to capture built environment characteristics. Results can be utilized to inform population-based strategies to reduce health disparities and improve health. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health The epidemic rise in obesity, related chronic diseases, and substance abuse in recent decades signal the importance of structural forces and social processes, but the dearth of data on contextual factors limits the investigation of multilevel effects on health. The development of the Neighborhood Looking Glass will be a significant benefit to neighborhood effects researchers, harnessing the largely untapped potential of street image data to capture built environment characteristics with potential impact on health. Results from our project can be utilized to inform system-wide and local strategies to improve community health.",Neighborhood Looking Glass: 360 Degree Automated Characterization of the Built Environment for Neighborhood Effects Research,9979947,R01LM012849,"['Accounting', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Family', 'Food', 'Food Access', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Glass', 'Grant', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Health Food', 'Health Personnel', 'Health behavior', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physical environment', 'Premature Mortality', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Indicator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site Visit', 'Social Environment', 'Social Processes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'density', 'health care availability', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'land use', 'obesity risk', 'object recognition', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'social', 'social media', 'walkability', 'young adult']",NLM,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,329703,-0.01649704753516148
"Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease. Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes, which can be largely attributed to lapses from the recommended diet. Our work has shown that dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals) are frequent during weight loss attempts (~3-4 times per week), associated with poorer weight losses, and triggered by momentary changing states (e.g., changes in mood or availability of palatable food). Thus, there is a clear need for innovative solutions that can provide dynamic in-the-moment interventions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in obesity treatment. Our research team was the first to develop a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that includes: 1) daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling via mobile device) of relevant behavioral, psychological, and environmental triggers for lapse; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information gathered via EMA to determine real-time lapse risk; & 3) delivery of brief intervention during high-risk moments. Our pilot work revealed that the JITAI was feasible, acceptable, and produced reductions in average lapse frequency. However, we have not yet shown a direct effect of the JITAI on eating behavior in the moment of heightened lapse risk and know little about the types of interventions that are most effective for reducing lapse. We therefore propose to extend our research via a micro- randomized trial (MRT), a methodology that involves random assignment to intervention (or control) at a specific decision point, i.e., when our algorithm predicts heightened risk for a lapse. The MRT will determine whether a specific intervention in a specific moment had its intended effect. We will therefore port our JITAI to a more scalable online platform and conduct a MRT to evaluate the effects of a generic lapse risk alert message and theory-driven just-in-time interventions on dietary lapses. After refinement testing with n=15 to ensure proper technical functioning of our updated JITAI, adults with overweight/obesity (n=159) will participate in a well-established 12-week online obesity treatment program + JITAI, with 12 weeks of JITAI-only follow-up. When an individual is at risk for lapsing s/he will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of 4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e., via EMA) and objectively (i.e., via wrist- based intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization. Results of the MRT will inform an optimized algorithm for intervention delivery that will drive the finalized JITAI. A future RCT will compare weight loss in obesity treatment with and without the optimized JITAI. This highly innovative approach will advance the science of adherence by supporting the development of sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior and informing JITAIs that target adherence to other health behaviors (e.g., medication, activity goals). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project targets dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment, which is recommended as a first-line intervention for cardiovascular disease. We propose to conduct a micro-randomized trial to empirically optimize a just-in-time adaptive intervention that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear clinical impact in future RCTs and pragmatic trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly.",Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial,10029156,R01HL153543,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Education', 'Energy Intake', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health behavior', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Palate', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychological Factors', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'brief intervention', 'clinically significant', 'dietary adherence', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'pilot trial', 'pragmatic trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'psychologic', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'skills training', 'theories', 'treatment program']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2020,727923,0.0019271278748314265
"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,9882859,R01ES031259,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood specimen', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Neurotoxicity', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Consequentialism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expenditure', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vitamin B 12', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biomarker development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'early childhood', 'exposed human population', 'genome-wide', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'methylation biomarker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'routine screening', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,438331,-0.031232681485319498
"Predictive modeling of peripartum depression ABSTRACT Psychiatric problems surrounding parturition affect both the mother’s health and her child’s developmental trajectory. Peripartum depression (PPD), referring to a depressive episode occurring during pregnancy or after childbirth, is both common and morbid. PPD has been implicated in various short and long term adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery and heightened risk for mental illness in the adult offspring. In extreme cases, PPD can lead to maternal suicide and/or infanticide. Although an estimated 760,000 American women (and children) suffer from PPD each year and screening for PPD has been recommended by the USPTF, no accurate screening tool is available to adequately identify women at risk of PPD. This novel study will capitalize on the rich clinical, demographic, and laboratory information in patients’ electronic medical reports (EMRs) to improve screening for PPD. We propose to implement advanced machine learning methods to build a model to optimize identification of women at risk for PPD. We we will adopt a psycho-social- biological approach of mental illness to prospectively explore the combined effect of various disease-related factors in improving the accuracy of PPD prediction. Our dataset will make use of a sample of 20,000 women who have been followed during their obstetrical care in two leading academic hospitals in Boston. We will gather information concerning socioeconomic factors, relevant obstetric factors, and mental and physical conditions in pregnancy and disease history, as derived from laboratory test results and the patient’s report. We expect our findings to advance scientific knowledge of women at risk for PPD. Our work may lead to the development of a screening protocol that is low-cost and easily performed by health providers in clinical settings. Early identification of women at risk could potentially allow targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of PPD in the US. This in turn could reduce treatment costs, avoid a potentially preventable disease, and improve the quality of care and health outcomes of mothers and their children. Our study accords with the NICD high priority area of research aimed at improving the health of women during and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes. The proposed project will further the NICHD mission that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that children achieve healthy and productive lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripartum depression (PDD) referring to the occurrence of depressive episode during pregnancy or following childbirth is a common and serious illness. While the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening for PPD, there is no accurate tool to predict women who would be at risk of suffering from PPD. The goal of this study is to test a machine learning predictive model of PPD using information in patients’ medical records to decrease PPD’s prevalence and ultimately prevent it.",Predictive modeling of peripartum depression,9958240,R03HD101724,"['Adopted', 'Adult Children', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Etiology', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Infanticide', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive service', 'Primigravidities', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening procedure', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Suicide', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Cost', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'antenatal', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'health of the mother', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obstetric care', 'patient health information', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'primipara', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'tool']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2020,84000,-0.0325597636588711
"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development,9893708,F31ES030263,"['Address', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flame Retardants', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenols', 'Placenta', 'Plastics', 'Policy Maker', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'consumer product', 'data management', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fundamental research', 'health of the mother', 'high dimensionality', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple datasets', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'pollutant', 'polybrominated diphenyl ether', 'prenatal exposure', 'public health intervention', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2020,32095,-0.008874039746769327
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9917845,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Appalachia', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'social structure', 'sociodemographics', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2020,371411,-0.01409187974680741
"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"Environment, Metabolomics, and PD Project Abstract Our PEG study is among the largest Parkinson's disease (PD) population-based study with exceptional high-quality disease characterization and in-depth exposure assessment. Patients are diagnosed and examined (multiple times) by a UCLA movement disorder specialist. We developed a longitudinal geographic information system (GIS) based assessment for pesticide exposures that links state-mandated information on type, date, and location of all agricultural pesticide applications in California recorded since 1974 to land use maps and study participants' residences and work places. Here we propose to combine a powerful new metabolomics tool and system biology analytic methods to identify signatures for toxic exposures that evoke long-term biologic responses. The metabolomics data we will generate will help us identify metabolic profiles for chronic environmental exposures for both PD patients and population controls. This will generate a first understanding of the metabolic consequences of chronic low dose pesticide exposure in PD. However, biologic processes, including biologic responses to chronic toxicant exposures and those involved in disease development, are highly dynamic and interactive systems. The PEG study is uniquely capable to begin investigating these multidimensional networks linking exposure and disease. We have already generated genome and epigenome profiles for 550 PD patients and 250 controls. Here we newly propose to generate and analyze serum based metabolome profiles (targeted and untargeted) for these same 800 study participants characterizing environmental pesticide exposures via metabolome wide association analyses. We aim to develop a metabolite signature of environmental exposure using supervised machine learning methods, and also determine if these are disease specific or found in both exposed cases and controls. Furthermore, incorporating our genome and epigenome information, we propose to use biological systems analysis to identify multi-omics network patterns that distinguish environmental exposures that contribute to PD onset and progression. We expect this to show a chronic response pattern across different molecular layers and are influenced by many environmental factors. Combining multi-omic measures based on multidimensional network and system analyses will address the gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD. Project Narrative Here we propose to build upon a unique resource - the PEG population-based Parkinson's disease (PD) study - to identify metabolic signatures of chronic environmental exposures and disease in 550 PD patients and 250 population controls. Importantly, we plan to integrate exposure and effect markers across multiple molecular layers (genome, epigenome, metabolome), with the goal to obtain a more holistic understanding of molecular changes due to chronic environmental exposures. Our approach incorporates multi-omics measures and multidimensional network and system analyses to address gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD.","Environment, Metabolomics, and PD",9858332,R21ES030175,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anions', 'Archives', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Caffeine', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatography', 'Chronic', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier Transform', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Policy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specialist', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'agricultural pesticide', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biological systems', 'brain health', 'case control', 'cell type', 'disorder control', 'disorder risk', 'environmental pesticide exposure', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'machine learning method', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pesticide exposure', 'population based', 'residence', 'response', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2020,234000,-0.010400901180008056
"Bringing real-time stress detection to scale: Development of a biosensor driven, stress detection classifier for smartwatches PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goals of this mentored, patient-oriented, research career development award are two-fold: 1) Characterize the autonomic nervous system correlates of stress-reactivity, both in laboratory and ambulatory contexts in order to inform the development of a biosensor driven, stress-detection classifier algorithm that can run on commercially available smartwatches, and 2) establish the principal investigator as an independent researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School. The specific aims of this research will be accomplished through an innovative study leveraging the strengths of traditional laboratory-based, psychophysiological research, and cutting-edge, in natura monitoring of stress and stress’ autonomic correlates using a combination of ecological momentary assessment of affect, and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring. This research will inform the development of a stress-detection algorithm that will run on commercially available smartwatches. The clinical and health applications for real-time stress detection are numerous, but this technology holds particular promise for individuals in early recovery from alcohol use disorder for whom unchecked stress heightens risk for alcohol use and engagement in other maladaptive coping behaviors. The smartwatch-embedded stress detection algorithm developed in this research will ultimately be linked to existing smartphone-based relapse prevention apps that will prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use risk. Aims of the principal investigator’s career development and training plan include, 1) learning fundamental principles of machine learning with an emphasis on biosensor technologies, 2) gaining facility with Matlab programming, with an emphasis on signal analysis and psychophysiological model building, 3) broadening expertise in cardiovascular waveform and interval analysis with particular emphasis on artefact management, and 4) acquiring skills in the development and application of mHealth-based clinical interventions. These goals will be achieved through a training plan comprised of mentorship, formal coursework, seminars, conferences, and manuscript preparation. Knowledge gained via the training plan will be augmented by the research undertaken. Drs. John Kelly, Paolo Bonato, Gari Clifford, and Bettina Hoeppner will serve as mentors on this award, and will provide targeted expertise in machine learning approaches, Matlab programing, artefact management, and mHealth treatment development. Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School provides an exceptional environment in which to conduct this training and research. By the end of the 5-year award period, the goals are to have a working stress-detection classifier algorithm ready for R01 testing, and for the principal investigator to be established as an independent investigator. This award is consistent with NIH's goal of increasing and maintaining a strong cohort of investigators to address the nation's clinical research needs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder carries tremendous personal and societal costs, and in spite of best clinical efforts, this disorder is characterized by very high relapse rates following treatment. There is a pressing need for novel interventions that prevent alcohol use relapse, and help individuals achieve sustained remission. This study will develop the algorithms that will enable the biosensors embedded in commercially available smartwatches to detect stress in real time using physiological measures of autonomic arousal, which will ultimately be used to trigger smartphone relapse prevention apps to prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use relapse risk.","Bringing real-time stress detection to scale: Development of a biosensor driven, stress detection classifier for smartwatches",9891764,K23AA027577,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biosensor', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Coping Behavior', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Notification', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'acute stress', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'classification algorithm', 'classifier algorithm', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'deter alcohol use', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'early alcohol use', 'experience', 'fitness', 'health application', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'model building', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'reduced alcohol use', 'relapse risk', 'skills', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'societal costs', 'stress management', 'stress reactivity', 'stress state', 'stressor', 'symposium', 'therapy development', 'time use', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIAAA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,184140,-0.08242107188799752
"Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence Youth violence victimization is common and increases risk for a host of negative health outcomes, most notably posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is the strongest predictor of poor quality of life following trauma, even among those injured during the event. Given the potential harmful sequelae of trauma exposure, it is crucial to identify acute post-victimization risk factors that predict chronic PTSD. At this juncture relatively little data exists to aid in prediction of youth at risk for poor long-term adjustment following victimization or other types of trauma, and there are no studies measuring relevant neural systems. Thus, our team aims to 1) characterize acute post-victimization neurobehavioral predictors of risk for chronic PTSD with a focus on prefrontal-subcortical function during processing of threat processing and frontoparietal networks for cognitive control, and 2) use machine learning to identify the most robust set of predictors of chronic PTSD drawn from a comprehensive assessment of youth neuroimaging, behavior and self-report, parent and family factors, and neighborhood and community variables. Our team is well-prepared to successfully achieve these aims, as we have relevant expertise in conducting prospective longitudinal assessment of acute neurobehavioral predictors of risk for PTSD in adults (Larson), conducting longitudinal assessment of youth victims of violence (Levas), and longitudinally characterizing neurobehavioral profiles of youth PTSD (Herringa). We will recruit youth victims of violence aged 10-16 from the Emergency Department at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and conduct comprehensive assessments at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months following victimization. To achieve a final sample of 200 youth at 12 month follow-up, we will recruit 240 youth, oversampled for risk for PTSD based on currently available brief self-report indicators. Each assessment will include measures of neural systems instantiating threat processing, including both reactivity to threat and anticipation of unpredictable and predictable threat, and cognitive control, along with measures of PTSD and other symptoms, cognitive functioning, family environment, social and school functioning, and socioenvironmental factors (e.g. neighborhood disadvantage, discrimination). We will examine how acute post- victimization variables (2 week) and early change following victimization (from 2 weeks to 3 months) predict PTSD and other outcomes twelve months later. We will use both hypothesis-driven analyses focusing on a priori specified regions and predictors, as well as comprehensive data-driven machine learning analyses. The comprehensive assessment will allow for determination of the additional utility of neural markers for predicting risk beyond previously identified self-report indicators. We expect this project to lead to identification of predictors of risk for PTSD following victimization that are linked to underlying processes (hyper-responsivity to threat, aberrant cognitive control) that can directly inform preventive interventions, ultimately improving the quality of life for youth victims of violence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying youth victims of violence most at risk for long-term post-traumatic distress is a pressing public health problem. This work seeks to identify dysregulation in neural circuitry supporting cognitive and affective processes two weeks after victimization predicts PTSD and other post-trauma symptom twelve months later. These data will advance our understanding of neurobiological factors associated with vulnerability to specific trauma-related pathology and provide an important step toward identifying appropriate early interventions in the wake of violence victimization.",Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence,9941466,R01MH124076,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Early-life trauma', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Victimization', 'Violence', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'brain health', 'child and adolescent victimization', 'clinical care', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'physical assault', 'post-trauma', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'sexual assault', 'social', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic stress', 'violence exposure', 'violence victimization', 'youth violence']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2020,768281,0.005620889815728865
"Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center The “clinical high risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome is an antecedent period characterized by attenuated psychotic symptoms that are marked by subtle deviations from normal development in thinking, motivation, affect, behavior, and a decline in functioning. Early intervention in this CHR population is critical to prevent psychosis onset as well as other adverse outcomes. However, the presentation of symptoms and subsequent course is highly variable, and there is a paucity of biomarkers to guide treatment development. Thus, to improve predictive models that are clinically relevant, several issues need to be addressed: 1) focusing on outcomes beyond psychosis; 2) taking into account heterogeneity in samples and outcomes; and 3) integrating data sets with a broad array of variables using innovative algorithms to overcome variability across studies. To address these challenges, the proposed “Psychosis Risk Evaluation Data Integration and Computational Technologies: Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center” (PREDICT-DPACC) brings together a multidisciplinary team of highly experienced researchers with proven capabilities in all aspects of large-scale studies, CHR studies, as well as computational expertise. The ultimate goal is to identify new CHR biomarkers, and CHR subtypes that will enhance future clinical trials. To do so, the PREDICT-DPACC will 1) aggregate extant CHR- related data sets from legacy datasets; 2) provide collaborative management, direction, data processing and coordination for new U01 multisite network(s); and 3) develop and apply advanced algorithms to identify biomarkers that predict outcomes, and to stratify CHR into subtypes based on outcome trajectories, first from the extant data and then refined and applied to the new data. The PREDICT-DPACC team has the broad, comprehensive, and robust infrastructure that is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the inclusion of multiple data types and to optimally address the needs of the CHR U01 network(s). Carefully selected extant data will be rapidly obtained, processed, and uploaded to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Proposed analysis methods are powerful and robust, leveraging the expertise and experience of computer scientist developers, and experienced clinical researchers. The U01 network(s) will be coordinated by a team that is experienced in managing large studies, familiar with the needs of such studies, flexible, and is knowledgeable in all aspects of CHR studies, including measures, outcomes, biomarkers, and cohorts. Upon meeting the goals of this U24, and the supported U01 network(s), the expected outcomes of the PREDICT-DPACC will be new predictive biomarkers for CHR outcomes, new definitions of CHR subtypes that are clinically useful, and new curated and comprehensive CHR datasets (extant and new) as well as processing tools and prediction algorithms that are shared with the research community through the NIMH Data Archive. NARRATIVE The “Clinical High Risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome in young people represents an opportune window for early intervention to prevent the onset of psychosis and other disorders, and to forestall disability; however, clinical heterogeneity and the paucity of biomarkers have hampered the development of effective intervention. To address these challenges, working with NIMH and key stakeholders, we will harmonize and aggregate existing “legacy” CHR data, and guide and coordinate the collection of new data across a network of sites, to develop biomarker algorithms that can predict individual trajectories for diverse outcomes. This proposal leverages a multidisciplinary team with broad and CHR-specific experience in large-scale multisite and multimodal studies (including clinical trials), along with expertise in data type-specific processing, coordination, analysis, and computational analyses (e.g., machine and deep learning tools from artificial intelligence, and advanced statistical approaches), ethics, community outreach, and data dissemination, all of which will ensure the success of this project.","Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center",10092398,U24MH124629,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality Control', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical tool', 'attenuated psychosis syndrome', 'base', 'bioinformatics infrastructure', 'candidate marker', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical risk', 'clinical subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data archive', 'data dictionary', 'data dissemination', 'data harmonization', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'outcome prediction', 'persistent symptom', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'resilience', 'response', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'working group']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U24,2020,3935239,-0.010013808802032525
"The Impact of Air Pollution Exposure on COVID-19 Severity and Mortality PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently the most emergent public health disaster of the entire world. COVID-19 disproportionately affects older adults, people having history of smoking and comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. There is no vaccine and treatment for COVID-19, therefore, public health interventions have been taken to control disease transmission. Also, searching modifiable environmental factors that can help reduce the COVID-19 severity and mortality is crucial. Air pollution exposure has been shown to have a systemic effect on the human body including lung function impairment and immune alterations. Recent two ecologic studies from Europe and the United States have suggested that higher long-term ambient air pollution exposure (PM2.5 and NO2) significantly contributes to the COVID-19 mortality. These findings from aggregated data of air pollution exposure and total number of deaths in large geographic areas need to be further verified by cohort study with individual data of air pollution exposure and COVID-19 case progression and mortality. Also, susceptibility factors such as low social economic status (SES), race/ethnicity, smoking exposures and comorbidities need to be accounted for in the analysis. To address the urgent public health question about the role of air pollution exposure in COVID-19 progression, we propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study based on the existing EMR data of all COVID- 19 cases (n>7000) diagnosed at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) medical centers. Specific aims of this proposal have been expanded from our ongoing NIEHS-supported R01 study investigating prenatal air pollution exposure and children's autism risk among 440,000 KPSC mother-child pairs (APAR study, 1R01ES029963). In this proposal, the main outcomes of interest are COVID-19 severity assessed by hospitalization, ICU admission and ventilator use, as well as death. Details dates will be available through EMR. Natural language processing technologies will be applied to identify the date of first COVID-19 symptom onset for each case. Thereafter, the earliest date among COVID-19 symptom onset and clinical diagnosis will be used as the study entry date. Then short- and long-term air pollution exposure will be estimated for each case by averaging air pollution exposure levels during one-month and one-year before the study entry date. Both ambient (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3) and traffic-related (line dispersion model estimated NOx) air pollution exposure will be assessed based on individual residential addresses. Detailed residential history of all KPSC members have been well-maintained by the KPSC system. Key covariates including age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking exposure, body mass index, comorbidities, medication use, and meteorological data will be extracted to control for confounding and identify susceptible high risk subgroups.

"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10030705,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural regeneration', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2020,185878,-0.016335652314506018
"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches",9883835,R01HL141823,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronary heart disease', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Policy', 'Hepatocyte', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Low Prevalence', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proxy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic evaluation', 'economic value', 'genetic testing', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'models and simulation', 'pediatric patients', 'population based', 'population health', 'premature', 'premature atherosclerosis', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,804498,-0.030023164901215496
"Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding Project Summary Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the factors that promote disease risk and resilience may be distinct in men and women. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this possibility are poorly understood, however, because the vast majority of pre- clinical animal research has been conducted in males. In addition, the behavioral outcome measures used to understand learned fear have focused predominantly on passive, or freezing behavior. We recently identified an active, escape-like conditioned fear response in rats (“darting”) that occurred almost exclusively in females and was predictive of improved extinction retention. A better understanding of potentially sexually dimorphic mechanisms that drive this behavior could open new avenues for treatment of disorders that are more prevalent in women, like PTSD. We propose here to define the neural circuitry that drives the selection of conditioned darting vs. freezing, and how that integrates with known extinction circuits to promote extinction retention. Our preliminary data implicate the infralimbic cortex (IL) in this role, and we will use pharmacological, chemogenetic, and viral techniques to probe how descending IL projections to the dorsal and ventral periaqueductal gray (PAG) may mediate a strategic switch between active and passive responding and drive long-term behavioral flexibility through putative collaterals in the amygdala. We will then use sophisticated machine vision and machine learning-based tools to define the broader behavioral repertoires within which darting exists, thereby identifying a multifaceted phenotype that could provide insight into the mechanisms underlying individual differences in stress resilience and vulnerability. Project Narrative Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the risk factors that promote disease susceptibility may be distinct in men and women. This project explores the neurobiological basis of divergent (active vs. passive) fear responses in males and females, which could help identify novel ways to prevent or treat post-traumatic stress disorder.",Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding,10033671,R01MH123803,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Crete', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dorsal', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'FOS gene', 'Female', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Rattus', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sex Differences', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'coping', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine vision', 'male', 'men', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'selective expression', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'stress resilience', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,503268,-0.010593656823914626
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project focuses on human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife, with an emphasis on factors that moderate and mediate brain-to- risk relationships.

"Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory- motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.” Project Narrative Motor development plays a crucial role in the acquisition of social communication skills, cognition, and language, and motor impairments detrimentally affect downstream development. Many neurodevelopmental disorders describe motor impairments as an early comorbid symptom; however, current standardized assessments of motor function fail to clearly characteize these early motor impairments. This longitudinal study will utilize quantitative measures to objectively characterize the earliest manifestation of motor impairments in infants at high risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and elucidate the mechanistic relationship of these impairments to symptoms of autism and other adverse developmental outcomes with the goal to improve early identification and inform targeted interventions.",Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders,9977506,K23HD099275,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Life Experience', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal Brain Injury', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Space Perception', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual Motor Coordinations', 'advanced analytics', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'standardize measure', 'statistics', 'study population', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2020,177444,-0.05026509390894319
"Direct sub-second measurement of neuromodulator signaling during risky decision-making PROJECT SUMMARY Much work in decision neuroscience has been predicated on the hypothesis that dopaminergic signaling plays a critical role in value representations and their updating, and recent work has linked abnormalities in such value representations to specific features of psychiatric illness (e.g., anhedonia in major depression). However, despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Indirect evidence from pharmacological studies have suggested both serotoninergic and noradrengergic signaling may play roles in representations of risk; however, direct measurement of serotonin or norepinephrine signaling during risky choice has yet to be examined in humans. Recent advances by MPI Montague’s group allow the unprecedented ability to track neuromodulator responses with high temporal resolution and chemical specificity. Specifically, MPI Montague’s team is able to directly and simultaneously measure dopamine and serotonin responses in awake humans with the temporal resolution (~ 1 ms) required to examine the relationship of neuromodulator release with decision-making processes. For signal identification and extraction, the recording method uses machine-learning algorithms (elastic net regression) combined with electrochemistry using only off-the shelf hardware and software. The product of this ‘elastic net electrochemistry’ is recordings of in vivo neuromodulator fluctuations at sub-second resolution. This application merges the decision neuroscience expertise of MPI King-Casas with these advances of MPI Montague to directly examine serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic functioning during risky choice. To achieve this goal, we will record neuromodulator responses in participants with medication-resistant epilepsy who already have intracranial depth electrodes in place for phase-II monitoring. Depth electrodes will be implanted by our neurosurgery colleagues at Virginia Tech’s medical affiliate Carilion Clinic (Carilion Clinic PI: Witcher). During recording, participants will perform i) a risk elicitation task (Holt & Laury type task) and ii) a reward learning task (multi-arm bandit task) that have been shown by our group and others both to reliably evoke neural responses associated with risk and representations as they are monitored in a standard (i.e., non-surgical) hospital suite. Depth recordings will be made using a standard montage that includes multiple contacts along the dorsal-rostral axis of the medial prefrontal cortex. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Here, we take advantage of a new technology to directly measure serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine on a sub-second basis to investigate the neurocomputational role of these neurotransmitters in risky choice.",Direct sub-second measurement of neuromodulator signaling during risky decision-making,9961146,R01MH122948,"['Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Computer software', 'Decision Making', 'Dopamine', 'Dorsal', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morale', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology Study', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'noradrenergic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'temporal measurement']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2020,717227,-0.017815337552163343
"Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary/Abstract At least 40% of children will experience a traumatic event. Of those who experience a trauma, 15-40% will develop Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and other adverse psychiatric, health, and functional outcomes (herein called Child Traumatic Stress - CTS). Despite decades of research on risk factors for CTS, the field has not arrived at specific risk factor models that can accurately predict the likelihood of CTS outcomes or identify factors that – if changed – would change their likelihood. Knowledge about changes in factors that result in changes in outcomes is, by definition, causal. The vast majority of findings in the literature on risk for CTS cannot provide such causal knowledge because such findings were based on the application of correlational methods to observational data. Experimental research cannot – for all practical purposes - be conducted for human research on risk for CTS. Thus, the field is left with correlational observational research as the near exclusive generator of empirical knowledge on risk for CTS, and such knowledge is unsuitable to guide the actions (i.e. interventions) that must be taken to change children's likelihood of acquiring CTS outcomes. We propose to address this considerable barrier to progress by applying methods that can enable confident causal inference with large observational data sets containing a broad diversity of risk variables for CTS. Machine Learning (ML) predictive and causal modeling methods will be applied to discover causal relationships among measured variables from observational data: and from such determined causal relationships, to estimate the effect on a CTS outcome when a causal variable is manipulated (i.e. intervention simulation). We will build models for outcomes associated with childhood trauma in the literature and that entail significant burden to children's well-being, functioning, and development: PTSD, Depression, Substance Abuse, Health, and Educational Performance. Project Narrative This application proposes research to apply an array of powerful and innovative computational methods – well validated in other fields – to advance the capacity to predict and prevent traumatic stress in children and adolescents. These methods will be applied to several highly relevant, existing data sets that cover diverse populations of traumatized youth and with diverse data collection designs. The data sets and the analytic methodologies have been carefully selected to advance knowledge related to prediction, discovery of causal mechanisms, and the identification of promising preventative interventions for child traumatic stress.",Computational Models for the Prediction and Prevention of Child Traumatic Stress - Resubmission - 1,10021724,R01MH119114,"['18 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Child Welfare', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Youth', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'social', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'traumatic stress', 'traumatized children']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,613498,-0.02859500308182848
"Administrative Supplement to Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project focuses on human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife, with an emphasis on factors that moderate and mediate brain-to- risk relationships.

"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief.

"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,9925813,K01HL141637,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perceived quality of life', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Professional Organizations', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'career', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health data', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'patient expectation', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'working group']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,170750,-0.005357044378153627
"Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot randomized, controlled trial with outcomes assessment using digital phenotyping Over 15 million Americans serve as family caregivers of relatives with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD- Related Dementias (ADRD), and this often subjects them to tremendous stress, resulting in poorer mental health and higher risk of physical illness. Due to emotional and physical exhaustion, lack of time, and immediate needs related to caring for their loved ones, caregivers often forego their own self-care. The National Institute on Aging Strategic Plan identifies the need to develop better interventions to improve the mental and physical health of caregivers as a crucial priority area. The purpose of this Paul B. Beeson K76 Emerging Leaders Career Development Award in Aging Research application is to support the research training of Dr. Felipe Jain, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Jain’s work aims to improve caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone with guided imagery and mindfulness therapies that reduce stress and help the caregiver improve mentalizing (understanding the links between mind and behavior) of themselves, their loved one suffering from dementia and others in their social milieu. Further, Dr. Jain hopes to develop the skills in machine learning and data science necessary to estimate early changes in caregiver symptoms remotely and passively, without any additional effort on the part of the caregiver who is often already overwhelmed, using smartphone sensors that capture information about caregiver behaviors.  In the conduct of this K76 award, Dr. Jain will lead a randomized, controlled trial for 120 AD/ADRD caregivers 60 years of age or older. Caregivers will be assigned to receive smartphone applications that either include a caregiver skills toolbox alone, or a caregiver skills toolbox combined with Mentalizing Imagery Therapy (MIT). MIT uses guided imagery and mindfulness to help caregivers improve stress, reduce negative mood and increase mentalizing. Theoretically, stress reduction resulting from MIT due both to mindfulness skills and better mentalizing of the care recipient and others should help caregivers better implement tools for caregiving within their unique social environment and accounting for the care recipient’s individual symptoms.  The first aim of the study is to determine the clinical effects of App-delivered caregiver skills with or without MIT on caregivers’ perceived stress, caregiver burden, mastery, depression and insomnia. The second aim is to develop behavioral markers from smartphone sensors that are associated with outcomes. We will (1) test the hypothesis that smartphone estimated sleep is longitudinally associated with caregivers’ self-reported insomnia, stress and burden and (2) determine the feasibility of identifying behavioral features with machine learning to predict day-to-day sleep and stress. If successful, this research will help open a new avenue of AD/ADRD caregiver research and treatment focused on improving mentalizing. It will also inform the field of aging research regarding the feasibility of using smartphone sensors to detect changes in early behavioral markers that may be used by clinicians to intervene for older adults at risk of poor outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research will promote the public health of more than 15 million Americans who serve as family caregivers for relatives with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. It will assess whether stress reduction therapy incorporating guided imagery practices that promote perspective taking and empathy can improve the effects of family caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone. It will also test the feasibility of using smartphone estimated markers to track caregiver insomnia and stress, which could eventually help reduce caregiver suffering and healthcare costs by identifying early warning signs of treatment failure and symptomatic worsening.","Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot randomized, controlled trial with outcomes assessment using digital phenotyping",10045735,K76AG064390,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic stress', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotional Stress', 'Empathy', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Friends', 'Guided imagery', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Mindfulness Training', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self Care', 'Sleep', 'Sleeplessness', 'Social Environment', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'care giving burden', 'care recipients', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiving', 'clinical effect', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'exhaustion', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'loved ones', 'medical schools', 'mental imagery', 'mindfulness', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'negative mood', 'novel therapeutics', 'perceived stress', 'physical conditioning', 'predict clinical outcome', 'primary caregiver', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychological symptom', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'skills', 'skills training', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'stress reduction', 'tool']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K76,2020,213157,-0.058064957629689586
"Investigating the impact and patterns of homologous recombination and adaptive evolution on bacterial genomes Project summary In contract to sexual organisms, the mechanisms of population genetics in bacteria are far less understood. Two fundamental aspects of bacterial population genetics remain sorely understudied: i) the impact of DNA exchange on the evolution of bacterial genomes and populations is largely unknown. ii) the prominence of adaptive evolution has not been comprehensively assessed in bacteria. Determining how recombination and adaptive evolution impact bacteria is key to understand the biology of these organisms and to develop relevant models of their evolution. Although bacteria reproduce clonally, there is increasing evidence that the vast majority of these organisms are capable of homologous recombination by exchanging pieces of DNA in a process similar to gene conversion in animals and plants. This process enhances microbial capacity to adapt to stresses or changing environments and the exchange of DNA between bacterial strains is a major concern for human health as exemplified by the transfer of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Despite the central role of this process, the rates and patterns of recombination remain unresolved in bacteria. The extent of recombination often varies greatly from one study to another and, as a result, the same bacterial species can be perceived as clonal in one study and highly recombining in another. In this project, we propose to re-evaluate the landscape of recombination rates and patterns along the genomes of hundreds of bacterial species. Using new methodological frameworks based on Approximate Bayesian Computation and Deep Learning, we will identify the factors shaping the variation in recombination rate across bacteria. We will also uncover recombination rate variation across bacterial chromosomes (i.e. hot spots and cold spots). Our rate estimates will also allow us to study how recombination drives the evolution of genomic architecture of bacteria, including turnover in gene content. Finally, we will quantify the impact of adaptive evolution in bacteria, which may be substantially larger than in other organisms due to large bacterial effective population sizes. We will also investigate the relationship between adaptation and recombination, and identify the genes/pathways responsible for adaptation. In summary, this study will evaluate the rates and patterns of recombination across hundreds of species, determine the factors driving the evolution of the recombination process, reveal the role of adaptive evolution in bacteria, and the interplay between recombination and adaptation. Project narrative Homologous recombination and adaptive evolution are key mechanisms driving bacterial adaptation to new environments and new treatments. The proposed study aims to apply new approaches to determine the rates and patterns of recombination across genomic data in order to identify the factors shaping the rates and landscapes of recombination as well as the impact of adaptive evolution on bacteria.

"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality. Rates of depression begin to rise rapidly in early-mid adolescence and peak in early adulthood. This project seeks to identify early antecedents and risk factors for the onset of depressive disorders and to understand the processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically signficant psychopathology.

"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls.

"Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes Project Summary Motor vehicle crashes lead causes of adolescent mortality, making this a major health threat facing US adolescents. Given that 95.6% of novice driver crashes are due to driver error, improved skill should reduce crash incidence. Research supports this: novice driver crash rates peak immediately following licensure and decline steeply with experience gained over the months following licensure. However, it is not known which critical driving skill deficits present at licensure predict crashes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop interventions prior to licensure that can lead to the safest independent driving post licensure. With this R21 project, we will identify deficits in driving skills that are (a) associated with major predictors of early crash risk (age at licensure and sex) and that (b) can predict differences in crash rates within the first year of independent licensure. We will leverage our exclusive access to an innovative, newly available data source for young driver research. To enable study of safety critical driving skill deficits in novice drivers, results from a new (as of July 2017) virtual driving test (VDT) - developed by the PI, adopted by the State of Ohio and delivered immediately prior to the on-road licensing examination - will be linked to Ohio licensing and crash data. We propose these aims: Aim 1: identify skill clusters using multivariate clustering, regression and machine learning techniques to test the hypothesis that these clusters are related to age at licensure, sex, and time spent in the learner period; Aim 2a: use data on driving skills linked with reported crash data in Ohio to determine whether the skill clusters identified in Aim 1 are associated with crash risk; and Aim 2b: determine if those skill clusters from Aim1 are predictive of crashes in rural teen drivers. With a large sample of new driver applicants (>25,000), this study will examine, for the first time, differences in skill, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will create a normative dataset of novice driver skills; classify skill deficits by age, sex and time in learner period; and quantify the relationship between skill deficits and crash rates during the first 2 months of licensure (when crash rates are highest for young drivers) and the following 10 months as experience accumulates. If the use of the VDT proves successful in predicting crash risk, we will be able to identify novice drivers with elevated crash risk before granting a license. This R21 will enable the following lines of research: (1) Develop new interventions that address skill deficits through training, individualized to the needs of the novice driver (in partnership with Ohio). (2) Develop or adapt advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or self-driving vehicle technology to mitigate identified skill deficits (as part of Dr. Winston’s National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center). (3) Conduct a prospective study (R01) of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk. Narrative We will identify safety-critical driving skill deficits immediately prior to licensure that predict crashes, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will leverage exclusive access to newly available data on >25,000 novice drivers: state licensing and crash data linked to results from a new (as of July 2017), well-validated virtual driving test that identifies driving skill deficits (adopted by Ohio). If this R21 finds the VDT successful in predicting crash risk, we plan to: (1) conduct a future study of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk and (2) develop new interventions (training and vehicle technology) to address this risk.","Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes",10000116,R21HD099635,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industry', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Licensure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Police', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vehicle crash', 'Young driver', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'design', 'driving skills', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prospective', 'safety study', 'sex', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suburb', 'virtual']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,210334,-0.011774970135345595
"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,10017817,R01AG064589,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Calendar', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research Design', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'To specify', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'cohort', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'design', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'population health', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'time use', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'trend analysis', 'venous thromboembolism']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,549226,-0.020803143686059088
"Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality. Project Summary/Abstract  While exposure to high ambient temperature (i.e., heat) has long been recognized as a threat to public health, the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat- related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecasted extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and government officials. However, it is largely unknown: (1) what are the optimal metrics of heat stress to inform when to issue heat alerts, (2) how effective are heat alerts in protecting the public’s health and (3) what factors make heat alerts comparatively more or less effective in some places or in some people versus others. In the absence of such information, we will fail to maximize the public health benefits of heat alerts.  The goals of this proposal are to identify the optimal health-based and location-specific metrics for issuing heat alerts, to estimate the causal benefits of heat alerts, and to identify characteristics of individuals or communities associated with the greatest reductions in morbidity or mortality following heat alerts. Specifically, using national claims data on deaths and hospital admissions among the large, geographically diverse population of >60 million US Medicare beneficiaries age ≥65 years enrolled between 2001 and 2015, and on emergency department visits among >130 million participants of all ages from one of the nation’s largest health insurers, we propose to: (Aim 1) Use novel machine learning methods to identify the heat metric(s) (e.g., heat index, ambient temperature, spatial synoptic classification, wet bulb globe temperature, absolute humidity) that best predict excess heat-related deaths, emergency hospitalizations, and emergency departments visits in each location, (Aim 2) estimate the causal effects of NWS heat alerts on rates of mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits across the country and within groups stratified by health outcome, sex, and age group, and (Aim 3) assess how the benefits of heat alerts vary across characteristics of communities.  Key innovations of this proposal include a very large sample size, geographic diversity encompassing the entire US, the assessment across multiple health endpoints and age groups, and the use of sophisticated methods in statistical learning and causal inference. Collectively, the findings from this proposal will provide meteorologists, public health and emergency management officials, and local policy-makers with critical information to better protect public health during extreme heat events and guide more targeted future research on strategies to mitigate the adverse health effects of heat. Project Narrative Extreme heat is recognized as an important threat to public health, and the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat-related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecast extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and local government officials, although it remains largely unknown whether such alerts are effective in protecting people. We propose to provide forecasters and public health officials across the country with location-specific, health-based evidence as to the effectiveness of heat alerts and insights into how to improve them to better protect the public’s health.",Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality.,10164490,R01ES029950,"['Age', 'Air Conditioning', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Government Officials', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Hospitalization', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Local Government', 'Location', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'United States', 'Weather', 'age group', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'burden of illness', 'comparative', 'evidence base', 'extreme heat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health emergency', 'response', 'sex', 'statistical learning']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,613553,-0.003816624910478841
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive.

"ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE OF MALADAPTIVE SOCIOEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IN PRIMATES Specific Aims: Anxiety and depressive disorders are common, comorbid, and challenging to treat, ranking them among the greatest contributors to human suffering. An early-life extreme inhibited or anxious temperament, characterized by behavioral inhibition and extreme physiological responses to novel and/or potentially threatening contexts, is among the strongest predictors of the later development of anxiety and depressive disorders. Understanding the neurobiology of this early-life risk will identify treatment targets and provide a unique opportunity to develop scientifically founded behavioral and pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent stress-related psychopathology. Here, we propose a prospective longitudinal study in nonhuman primates (NHPs) to understand how inborn risk-factors and early-life inhibition lead to anxiety and maladaptive social behavior during adolescence and early adulthood. We will do this by leveraging the resources at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), including previous early-life assessments of behavioral inhibition, a multi-generational family pedigree, and large outdoor housing, alongside cutting-edge tools and analysis techniques, including multimodal neuroimaging and neural network-based animal tracking and behavioral analyses. We will use a prospective longitudinal design, and select 176 NHPs (88 F) previously phenotyped for early-life inhibition (3-4 months old) from the CNPRC’s large, multi-generational family pedigree. To study the emergence of anxiety- and depression-like symptomatology, half of the NHPs will be ""adolescents"" and half will be ""young adults"". We will perform in-lab behavioral and neuroimaging assessments, and longitudinal large-scale monitoring as animals navigate the entirety of their socio-geographic environment. First, we will examine how heritable-risk and early- life inhibition contribute to maladaptive socio-emotional behaviors in ecologically-valid contexts during adolescence and early adulthood (Aim 1). Starting in puberty, the risk for anxiety disorders is greater for girls than boys. Therefore, we also aim to demonstrate adolescent and young-adult sex differences in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 2). To understand how these factors are mediated by alterations in relevant brain circuitry, including the extended amygdala, each animal will undergo multimodal structural and functional neuroimaging assessments. Using these data, we will test specific hypotheses regarding the extent to which extended amygdala circuits link early-life inhibition to the progression of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 3). This combination of approaches promises to provide unprecedented insight into the neural substrates of maladaptive socio-emotional behavior during the transition to adulthood. PROJECT NARRATIVE A key challenge for psychiatry and clinical psychology is to discover, understand, and ultimately treat the root causes of the most common mental illness, including anxiety and depressive disorders. This project will harness an innovative combination of longitudinal measures and state-of-the-art tools—including a multi-generational pedigree, brain imaging, and deep neural networks—to objectively identify and prioritize the pathways that contribute to maladaptive social behavior as individuals mature into adults.

"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers).

"Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology Project Summary/Abstract The candidate’s long-term goal is to become an independent investigator focused on the neurophysiological pathways that link psychological stress with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individual differences in biological responses to acute psychological stress have been shown to predict risk for subclinical and clinical markers of CVD, indicating that variation in the stress response relates to measurable health outcomes. The proposed research and career development program will position the candidate to definitively address open and mechanistic questions on cardiovascular stress physiology with a multi-dimensional approach. The overall objective of the current project is to identify the ‘brain–cardiovascular’ pathways of metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress. The central hypothesis is that metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress are caused by increased brain activation in areas associated with cardiovascular and autonomic control. In extension, the candidate will test whether altering brain function via neuromodulation will regulate downstream cardiovascular responses. Proposed are two independent studies. In Aim 1, we will newly examine the relationship between metabolically excessive cardiovascular and neural responses using a cross-sectional approach. In Aim 2, we will measure stressor-evoked metabolic and cardiovascular responses before and after neuromodulation in an experimental approach. Participants will engage in a novel, non-invasive neuromodulation technique, transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS), known to alter the brain by increasing oxygenation, and will be compared to an established control. This research plan will help the candidate develop essential skills for career development including cardiovascular and metabolic testing, machine learning and cross-validation methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses, and utilizing a neuromodulation technique, TILS. The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide 5 years of training through a combination of research, classroom experiences, and mentoring to further the candidate in preparation for scientific independence. Specifically, the candidate will gain expertise in measuring metabolic activity, advance her computational neuroimaging analysis skills, become proficient in experimentally manipulating brain function, and develop necessary statistical skills. The project brings together a mentoring team of experts in their respective areas to provide the candidate with the necessary skills to continue on the trajectory to make a transformative contribution to the field of Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine. This project will provide vital information regarding the pathways between psychological stress and CVD risk while at the same time providing training and mentoring for the candidate’s further career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exaggerated physiological responses to psychological stress are commonly regarded as contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD), nonetheless, we lack an understanding of the mechanisms by which psychological responses to threat are translated into cardiovascular responses that are excessive to the immediate physiological needs of the individual. The project will use both cross-sectional and experimental approaches to examine how the brain and cardiovascular system interact during psychological stress and will provide a a more comprehensive understanding of the role the brain plays in metabolically-excessive responses to stress. This research is relevant to public health because it is a crucial step in understanding how psychological stress relates to a risk factor for CVD and is necessary to develop appropriate brain- based approaches to CVD risk prevention and stratification.",Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology,9986887,K01HL145021,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Markers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Limbic System', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic stress', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Professional Competence', 'Program Development', 'Psychological Stress', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'experience', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'stressor', 'time use']",NHLBI,BAYLOR UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,152186,-0.016537955150666712
"Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data Abstract Poor cancers, lengthy, achieve diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors, the most prevalent risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and can be treated to prevent disease. However, most diet, PA, and weight loss interventions are costly, and burdensome. Theseinterventions could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people a sustainable pattern of health behavior change so that treatment could be tapered and then stopped without behavioral relapse. Theories of habit formation might be assumed to address this problem, but they have not proved actionable to guide treatment decisions because they do not specify measurable criteria to reliably detect acquisition of a durable behavior pattern. Hence, we propose to identify behavior patterns that precede and predict maintenance of target-level behavioral improvement that persist after an intervention ends. The measurements needed to tell whether an intervention has durably entrained behavioral improvement are collected as part of diet, PA, and weight loss interventions. Specifically, participants continuously self-monitor their behavior digitally while assessments are relayed back to inform them about progress toward goals. We will analyze self-monitoring measures collected in 6 mHealth trials, conducted over 14 years among over 1,600 participants and more than 147,000 daily observations, to assess when an intervention has durably entrained targeted behaviors, as validated by their reliable persistence post- intervention. We will use location scale modeling to quantify change not only in the absolute level (location) of a behavior but also in its within-person variability (scale). We posit that the induction of durable behavior change requires both improvement in location (increases for healthy behaviors; decreases for unhealthy ones) and decrease in scale (i.e., increased behavioral consistency). Aim 1 will apply existing location scale methods to test the hypothesis that effective interventions will improve the location and reduce the scale of targeted behaviors across all trials. Because existing methods only measure scale at the group level and cannot measure the change in an individual's behavioral consistency that we need to personalize treatment adaptation, Aim 2 will extend location scale methods to enable individual estimation of the rate of change in behavioral consistency. Estimates derived from the new method will be analyzed to learn which parameters of behavior change during intervention are most associated with maintenance post-treatment. Finally, Aim 3 will apply machine learning to estimates from the extended location-scale mixed models to establish ranges and behavioral patterns that predict behavioral maintenance post-treatment. These resultswill inform behaviorinterventionscience and improve treatment efficiency by guiding real-timedecisions about the needed dosage and duration of behavioral treatments. Project Narrative Health promotion could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people have established a durable behavioral change so that their treatment could be tapered with low risk of relapse. The project introduces a new method of quantifying improvement in both the absolute level and the day-to-day consistency of targeted behaviors to learn when healthy changes are likely to persist.",Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data,10029357,R01DK125414,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Promotion Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Theory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vegetables', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cancer risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'control theory', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'digital', 'dosage', 'effective intervention', 'exercise intervention', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'intervention cost', 'mHealth', 'personalized medicine', 'post intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rate of change', 'relapse risk', 'theories', 'treatment duration', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,532871,-0.011793848344659201
"Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study Project Summary Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the primary cause of death and a major cause of years of life lost in the US and in the world. Cohort studies conducted in North America and Europe have provided crucial information in identifying exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as a cause of increased CVD risks. They have also pointed out important directions for future research, including the differential toxicity of PM2.5 chemical constituents to CVD incidence, the shape of concentration-response (C-R) functions, impact of exposure time windows and indoor air pollution exposure. The objectives of our study are to assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and incident CVD, and investigate the impact of exposure time window and indoor air pollution on these associations. Approach. We will conduct a retrospective multi-cohort study in China using personal health records from five national cohorts with adjudicated CVD endpoints maintained by the Fuwai Hospital. To provide individual-level exposure trajectories for ~120,000 cohort participants during their follow-up period, we will develop an ensemble machine learning model using ground air quality measurements, satellite data, and air quality model simulations to generate 1 km resolution national PM2.5 mass and major constituent (sulfates, nitrates, elemental carbon, organic carbon, lead, and nickel) exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 1). Using cohort data from 2007 to 2020 for our main analyses, we will use Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the associations of long-term exposures to PM2.5 constituents and adverse cardiovascular outcomes including total CVD, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke (Aim 2). Variations of this model will be used to investigate the shape of the C-R functions (linear vs. non-linear) as well as the impact of exposure errors using exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 2a). We will also examine windows of susceptibility for CVD endpoints using both time-variant and time- invariant exposure metrics (Aim 2b). Finally, we will evaluate the confounding effect of indoor air pollution on the C-R functions using a sub-cohort with estimated personal PM2.5 exposure estimates based on Fuwai Hospital's ongoing Multi-Region Panel Study (Aim 2c). Expected Results. Given the tremendous variability in PM2.5 constituent concentrations in China over time and space, our findings will contribute new PM2.5 constituent-specific C-R functions in CVD burden calculation in both the US and the world. Our study will also expand our knowledge on important factors affecting these associations such as exposure window and indoor air pollution. Narrative This study will assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in a retrospective multi-cohort study. Usinig five national cohorts and multi-city indoor air pollution measurements in China, we will investigate the shape of the CVD concentration-response functions and the impacts of indoor air pollution and exposure windows. The findings of this study will provide additional scientific support for designing effective policy and public health actions to lower the CVD burden in both the US and China.",Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study,10034502,R01ES032140,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Caliber', 'Carbon', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Concentration measurement', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Outcome', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Heavy Metals', 'Hospitals', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meteorology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nickel', 'Nitrates', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Health Records', 'Policies', 'Pollution', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Sulfate', 'Supercomputing', 'Tennessee', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urbanization', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'ambient air pollution', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'fine particles', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'land use', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'particle', 'response', 'study population', 'years of life lost']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,615182,-3.7989406639021887e-06
"LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sober Grid™ has developed a smartphone-based mobile application currently in use by over 120,000 individuals worldwide who are in, or seeking, recovery from drug and alcohol addiction. The “Grid”, as it is known, is a mobile-based, social recovery community providing rapid context- specific peer support, efficient help seeking, motivational enhancement exercises, and member ratings of support content – all aimed to prevent relapse. The overarching goal of this phase II project is to extend the current capabilities of the Sober Grid app to achieve a comprehensive social recovery support app featuring intelligent, context appropriate resource matching and 24/7 rapid response peer-coaching that is effective in reducing disordered substance use and is cost effective. We hypothesize that providing this functionality to high-risk members will be acceptable, feasible, increase access to and engagement with resources, and have a positive effect in increasing time to relapse and days of consecutive abstinence. The company’s priority commercial goal is to leverage the insights gained from its large database of information and behaviors recorded in its existing addiction recovery-focused social network, combined with its recently completed SBIR phase I work, to identify users at risk for relapse and deliver tailored lay and professional peer support, telehealth, and provider interventions prompted by near real-time automated risk indicators built into an Enhanced Sober Grid (ESG) solution. The specific goals of this proposed phase II project include: (1) implementing the relapse risk scoring algorithm successfully developed in phase I in a production environment, (2) developing a ML resource relevancy matching algorithm, and (3) using this system to pilot test the feasibility and acceptability as well as to estimate the effect on abstinence of providing peer-coaching and resource information to a national sample of Sober Grid members in recovery from non- alcohol/nicotine substances who are predicted to be at high risk for relapse. We will accomplish our objectives by: (Aim 1) Implementing an accurate, near real-time production risk prediction system; (Aim 2) Developing an enhanced, in-app substance-addiction recovery resource locator; and, (Aim 3) Determining the feasibility, acceptability and estimating the effect size of the proposed ESG among high relapse-risk participants in recovery from opioid, stimulant, or cannabis use. The expected impact of this project is to substantially enhance Sober Grid's ability to deliver effective and timely interventions to the right individuals, at the right time – including those high-need and underserved populations that would otherwise lack access to care and draw considerable resources from the healthcare system. This capability holds the promise to reduce drug and alcohol relapse and the associated negative health impacts at both an individual and societal level while reducing the total cost of providing treatment services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sober Grid is combining near real-time risk prediction with automated phone-app messaging, peer-coaching, and resource visibility and transparency in order to dramatically improve support for recovery from substance abuse. The strategy is to provide continuously available responsive connection and support with simple and familiar ways to search, filter, sort, identify, and review/rate resource options in order to lower overall relapse rates within the population, enabling Sober Grid users to achieve improved health outcomes and institutional payers to reduce the total cost of achieving those outcomes. Over time, the innovations resulting from this project will significantly reduce costs for individuals, public and private payers, the healthcare system, and society at large.",LEVERAGING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WITHIN SOCIAL NETWORKS TO MAXIMIZE DRUG ANDALCOHOL TREATMENT EFFICACY AND RELAPSE PREVENTION,9897501,R44DA044062,"['Abstinence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug usage', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Traits', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Published Comment', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Stream', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Underserved Population', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'alcohol relapse', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'drug relapse', 'effective therapy', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'marijuana use', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'member', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'opioid use', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'phase 2 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'provider intervention', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sobriety', 'social', 'social media', 'stimulant use', 'success', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2020,471700,-0.03818833593847098
"Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status Abstract Exposures to extreme events are increasingly common in many parts of the globe as a function of changes in weather patterns combined with rising sea levels, but there is a paucity of data to support scientific research on the implications of such exposures for population health and well-being over the long-term. STAR, the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, is a unique exception. We have interviewed respondents from 10 months before the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami for 10 years. This project will follow up the same respondents 15 years after the tsunami. The pre-tsunami baseline is a population-representative survey of 27,000 individuals who were living along the coast of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia. The tsunami constitutes a large-scale, unanticipated natural disaster in an area that was not thought to be prone to tsunamis. Moreover, its impacts were spatially idiosyncratic across the study area. Whether a particular community was inundated by the waves depended on a combination of the wave direction, seabed and shoreline topography. Of 368 baseline communities, about a fifth were devastated, a third were somewhat damaged and the rest were not directly affected. These features of the natural experiment provide the basis for identifying causal impacts of this major natural disaster which killed 170,000 people in the study area. The baseline and six post-tsunami waves collected during the prior phase of this project provide detailed information about exposure to and experience of the disaster and the evolution of health and wellbeing, broadly defined, for baseline respondents who survived the tsunami plus new household members. In each follow-up, we have interviewed 95% of all baseline survivors. In this continuation we will re-interview all baseline survivors and their household members fifteen years after the tsunami. We will place these data in the public domain, adding to prior waves of STAR already in the public domain to create an unparalleled data resource for the scientific community. Focusing on those who were exposed to the tsunami as children (age <12y and in utero at the time), we will investigate the impacts of tsunami exposure on the evolution of health, education and cognitive performance, linking outcomes to changes in material and psycho-social resources at the family level as well as community level resources. The latter will be measured combining administrative data and information extracted from satellite imagery using machine learning. Longer-term impacts, fifteen years after the tsunami, will exploit innovative human capital measures including biomarkers, executive function and emotional reactivity. Loss of one or both parents is among the most extreme exposures. We will explore the causal effects of orphanhood by comparing children who lost parents in the tsunami with those in the same community who did not. Project Narrative This project will field the fifteen year follow up of the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery (STAR), a large-scale longitudinal study of individuals differentially exposed to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The data provide unique information on the evolution of population health of a group of 27,000 individuals first interviewed before the tsunami, including biomarker measurements and integrated information on environmental change.",Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status,10052164,R01HD052762,"['Adolescence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Child Welfare', 'Cicatrix', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Data', 'Disasters', 'Documentation', 'Earthquakes', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Health education', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Household', 'Imagery', 'Indian Ocean', 'Individual', 'Indonesia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Natural Disasters', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Public Domains', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Rest', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Shock', 'Siblings', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'Sumatra', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Time', 'Tsunami', 'Variant', 'Water', 'acetone hydrazone', 'adverse childhood events', 'behavioral response', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'environmental change', 'executive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health economics', 'human capital', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'member', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'sea level rise', 'success', 'tool', 'weather patterns', 'young adult']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,544239,-0.01469273675795092
"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This large-scale study will advance the field by studying these different outcomes at their most basic functional level, and by identifying the biological mechanisms through which these specific types of distress and dysfunction develop.",Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes,10019595,U01MH110925,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Department evaluation', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Measurement', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychophysics', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'biobehavior', 'clinical decision support', 'design', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular marker', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'post-trauma exposure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'success', 'tool', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2020,3915397,-0.029619085310614534
"TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS ABSTRACT There is a growing interest in dietary patterns that capture the overall quality of diet as well as its constituent foods and nutrients. Commonly used dietary patterns are a priori diet score/index based on a set of dietary recommendations for a healthy diet (e.g., Mediterranean diet, Healthy Eating Index) or data-driven dietary patterns (e.g., prudent diet, western diet). Numerous studies have shown that those dietary patterns were related to the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. However, none of these dietary patterns incorporates eating behavior such as when we eat (i.e., eating time) and how often we eat (i.e. eating frequency) during a day. Since the amount of foods and nutrients consumed at one eating occasion influences the food consumption at the subsequent eating occasion and overall intake of the day, eating time and frequency are integral parts of dietary patterns. Furthermore, several lines of evidence consistently suggest that eating time and frequency as well as a meal composition play roles in body weight regulation and metabolic health and also regulate circadian rhythms, all of which may lead to metabolic dysfunctions and ultimately chronic diseases. Given a clear need to expand the dietary patterns framework and close a gap in dietary patterns methodological work, we propose to 1) develop a “temporal” dietary patterns based on temporal distribution of eating time and frequency during a day; and 2) evaluate if the identified temporal dietary patterns are associated with i) overall diet quality and nutrient intakes, ii) adiposity (e.g., BMI, waist circumference), and iii) metabolic biomarkers (e.g., insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL-cholesterol, c-reactive protein). To overcome a limitation that a conventional statistical method cannot capture multidimensional aspects of temporal dietary patterns (e.g., 24-dimensional feature vectors, multivariate dietary intake time-series data), we will use a novel approach combining nutrition and systems science—machine learning method. The Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP (IDATA) study that repeatedly collected diet, anthropometry, and blood samples from 1,021 men and women, 50-74 years old will be used. During one year, the IDATA study collected 24-hour recalls with clock time for each eating occasion, every other month (total six 24-hour recalls); measured anthropometry three times (baseline and at month 6 and 12); and collected blood twice, 6-month apart. Successful completion of our proposed study will identify temporal dietary patterns that are related to diet quality and metabolic health and validate the utility of temporal dietary patterns as a new tool for future research on diet-health relations and prevention of chronic diseases. NARRATIVE Eating behaviors and its impact on health are complex and multidimensional. The proposed study provides an excellent opportunity to develop new dietary patterns that capture eating behaviors such as when we eat and how often we eat during a day.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes Each year, more than 40 million Americans present to US emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation after trauma exposure (TE). While the majority of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). These APNS include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, minor traumatic brain injury (MTBI), and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of APNS are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This application, submitted in response to RFA-MH-16-500, proposes to identify and characterize the trajectories of the most common trauma-induced APNS within these domains of functioning using the RDoC classification system. 5,000 patients presenting to the ED after trauma will be screened, recruited, and will receive initial baseline evaluation in the ED, including blood collection and psychophysical, survey, and neurocognitive evaluation. They will be closely monitored over the next 8 weeks using innovative technologies (a wrist wearable for continuous-time monitoring of daytime physiology and sleep; a smart phone app for continuous-time monitoring of GPS and daily “flash” surveys; weekly web-based neurocognitive tests; periodic mixed-mode surveys; serial saliva collection; deep phenotyping [blood collection, fMRI, psychophysical evaluation]) and then followed less intensively using similar procedures (including deep phenotyping) over the remainder of a 52-week follow-up period. Adaptive sampling and state-of-the-art statistical methods will be used to (1) optimize precision in characterizing RDoC construct trajectories and (2) test theoretically-guided, “high yield” hypotheses evaluating the effects of pre-trauma, peritraumatic, and recovery-related factors on these trajectories and on multivariate RDoC construct trajectory profiles. The longitudinal schedule of rich, granular, multidimensional data collection in the study has been specifically designed to evaluate those constructs most important to post-TE outcomes and to test the proposed hypotheses. Ensemble machine learning methods will be used to develop tiered-targeted clinical decision support models to identify individuals at high risk of specific, common APNS outcomes. The close-knit ED research network that will undertake the study has a strong track record of prospective research on APNS and is ideally suited to carry out this exceedingly complex study. The study has been designed to be a resource for the entire field (for example, it has been designed and budgeted to collect and store a great many more biological samples at the NIMH Biorespository than we can analyze, for use by other investigators). Adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae include traditionally categorized outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, minor traumatic brain injury, and regional or widespread pain. However, these previous definitions of outcome have limited progress, and we now appreciate that the actual trajectories of these outcomes are multidimensional, incorporating a range of specific outcomes that may be best understood, and optimally targeted for intervention, by dividing across specific domains of functioning. This large-scale study will advance the field by studying these different outcomes at their most basic functional level, and by identifying the biological mechanisms through which these specific types of distress and dysfunction develop.",Longitudinal Assessment of Post-traumatic Syndromes,10021207,U01MH110925,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Department evaluation', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Measurement', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychophysics', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'biobehavior', 'clinical decision support', 'design', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular marker', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'post-trauma exposure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'success', 'tool', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2020,111582,-0.029619085310614534
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,10238415,R00ES028743,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Wind', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'indexing', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R00,2020,248998,-0.01679789730873345
"Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water PROJECT SUMMARY Detrimental health impacts of lead are largely attributed to long-term exposures to undetected lead, which are particularly troublesome and problematic because of the neurological damage to children, a situation that should not be tolerated by an advanced society like the U.S. The Flint Water Crisis and many other water catastrophes could have been avoided if early warning can be made possible through timely detection of lead in drinking water at the point of use. Our extensive customer interviews unambiguously suggest that current options for lead detection are unsatisfactory for on-site testing, as they represent two extremes: one being accurate but expensive, slow, and hard to use; and the other being low-cost, fast, and easy to use but inaccurate. NanoAffix Science LLC (NAFX) proposes to address the above unmet need and niche market product gap by empowering water users (particularly those in economically disadvantaged communities) and water service providers with a low-cost, easy-to-use, and accurate handheld tester for rapid detection of total lead in the tap water, right from the kitchen sink. The handheld lead tester combines a novel proprietary micro-sized sensor chip embedded in a proprietary test cell with a portable digital meter for direct readout of testing results. The Phase I project has successfully established the feasibility for detection of soluble lead in the tap water using an earlier version of the prototype handheld tester. The Phase II project will continue to develop the handheld tester toward total lead detection, better device uniformity, pilot scale-up manufacturing, and accurate calibration. At the end of the Phase II project, NAFX plans to produce 20 beta units of the handheld lead tester meeting all performance specifications for field validation by 10 initial customers (e.g., schools/daycares, end water users, and well water drillers). Major innovations of the proposed approach include accurate prediction of the particulate lead through partial digestion based on lead digestion kinetics, and strategic and synergistic improvement of the ultimate sensor prediction accuracy by (1) improving the physical sensor device uniformity (both intra-wafer and inter-wafer) through innovative device configuration and rigorous quality control; and (2) improving the calibration accuracy through innovative theoretical equilibrium chemistry modeling and machine learning data analytics. The NAFX handheld lead tester is the first of its kind to (1) offer all three features sought by customers: accurate, cheap, and fast; and (2) to simultaneously report all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead), which thus can not only alert customers to the lead hazard in their drinking water but also enable customers to identify possible causes and most effective solutions to mitigate the lead contamination. Therefore, the project will result in not only considerable economic impact but also immense societal impact. The regular use of NAFX handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NanoAffix Phase II project aims to continue the development of a handheld lead tester for accurate and low- cost onsite detection of total lead in tap water by untrained users, based on the success of the Phase I project. The project will contribute to enhancing the public health by offering an accessible tool for quantitative monitoring of all three types of lead: total lead (indicative of overall toxicity), soluble lead (indicative of slow leaching of lead), and particulate lead (indicative of sporadic flaking of lead) in tap water. The regular use of NanoAffix handheld tester - even if intermittently - will virtually eliminate the chance of chronic exposure to undetected lead, thereby accruing significant and predictable public health impact, especially in locations with the highest risk.","Graphene-based Nanosensor Device for Rapid, Onsite Detection of Total Lead in Tap Water",10024064,R44ES028656,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Calibration', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Disinfection', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'International', 'Interview', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lead Poisoning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Paper', 'Particulate', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'Wireless Technology', 'aqueous', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'drinking water', 'economic impact', 'empowered', 'graphene', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lead concentration', 'lead contamination', 'manufacturing scale-up', 'meetings', 'meter', 'nanosensors', 'novel', 'operation', 'portability', 'prototype', 'rapid detection', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'water quality', 'well water']",NIEHS,"NANOAFFIX SCIENCE, LLC",R44,2020,719088,-0.01301662410352071
"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Adolescent Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with CHANGEGRADIENTS with reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior a nd avoid risky substance use. It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment, CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.

"Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes Exercise is a challenge for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) because different activity types and intensities have different impacts on glucose concentrations. This challenge is amplified on competition days, as the added stress and high-intensity activity causes drastically different glucose responses than during exercise on non- competition days. This can occur due to a combination of increased hepatic glycogenolysis anaerobic exercise and the counterregulatory hormone response associated with the stress of competition. Thus, many people with T1D limit their physical activity due to fear of hypoglycemia during or after the activity and the majority of people with T1D do not engage in enough physical activity with less than 20% performing aerobic exercise more than twice per week. Regardless of the desire to exercise, people with T1D may be caught in scenarios where they are doing physical activity such running to catch a bus to commute to work may cause a spike in blood glucose concentration due to the anaerobic nature of the sprint and the added stress of arriving late if he or she were to miss the bus. One would not have had time to consider the appropriate insulin dose to prevent hyperglycemia and would benefit greatly from a system that would monitor these states and make corrections without requiring user input. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems will simplify the treatment of T1D and more advanced research is needed to increase their efficacy during and after exercise. The AP automates the computation of the proper insulin dose by using a continuous subcutaneous glucose sensor (CGM), an automatic control system, and an insulin pump that continuously infuses insulin into the subcutaneous tissue. The limitation of this configuration is its reliance on a single measurement, the glucose concentration, which varies in response to changes in many factors such as meals and exercise. The Cinar group at Illinois Institute of Technology pioneered the multivariable AP development. Signals streamed in real time from wearable devices complement glucose data to build accurate models to predict future variations in glucose levels. These models are updated recursively with each new set of measurements and used in hypoglycemia prediction and adaptive control. A new generation multivariable AP system that will incorporate the presence of competition stress with knowledge of physical activity type and intensity with well-developed machine learning algorithms for data interpretation in real-time, hypoglycemia early-warning systems, and automatic control will be more effective in improving glucose control in physically-active people with T1D. Additionally, this technology will be safer by dramatically reducing the number and duration of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, as compared to the current guidelines for maintaining euglycemia in exercise. Such AP systems can only be developed by using a sophisticated multivariable approach that includes glucose concentrations and a number of other physiological variables that impact glucose homeostasis during physical activity and under the presence of competition stress. PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of an exercise-smart artificial pancreas will improve the overall health and quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes through minimizing the number of treatment decisions required to maintain glucose homeostasis. This project will evaluate the glucose response during competitive and non-competitive exercise of various intensities, will build specific adaptive models that use data from glucose sensors and wearable devices to predict glucose trajectories for various exercise and stress conditions which will optimize insulin dosing with the exercise-smart artificial pancreas.",Modeling the Effect of Athletic Competition Anxiety on Blood Glucose Dynamics in Type 1 Diabetes,9994897,F31DK116524,"['Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Athletic', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Commuting', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Hormones', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ketosis', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Performance', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Physical Fitness', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societal Factors', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'experience', 'glucose sensor', 'glycogenolysis', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'meter', 'non-diabetic', 'pancreas development', 'physiologic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'sedentary', 'subcutaneous', 'treatment planning', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2020,41640,-0.0031223552953587716
"Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorders in Youth (COBY) study has comprehensively characterized the clinical course of a large sample of youth with bipolar disorder (BD), and has identified demographic and clinical factors that are associated with different illness courses. To date, however, COBY has not included neuroimaging assessments. Including such assessments now will allow, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of 13-year course of BD and treatment upon neural circuitry function and structure. Furthermore, the majority of COBY participants are currently between 18-30 years old, when the brain, and prefrontal cortex in particular, continues to develop. Including neuroimaging assessments in COBY participants now can thus take advantage of the neurodevelopmental processes occurring between 18-30 years where there are unique opportunities to intervene therapeutically to help normalize abnormalities in neural functioning and structure. Focusing on this age range will also provide a critically important opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course in adulthood. Having normal prefrontal cortical function and structure may predict better clinical course in adulthood, even in COBY participants with poor clinical course in youth, and may lead to decisions to reduce, or even stop, specific treatments in these individuals. In the proposed study, we will determine how previous BD clinical course (e.g., % time with mood symptoms vs. euthymic; % time with comorbid disorders) and treatment exposure from childhood into adulthood impacts neural circuitry functioning and structure supporting key NIMH RDoC information processing domains, and compare neuroimaging findings in COBY participants with those of demographically-matched healthy controls (Aim 1). We will also determine whether neuroimaging measures predict illness course in adulthood, beyond demographic and clinical factors, and previous clinical course in youth (Aim 2). We will use machine learning to explore patterns of wholebrain functioning, white and gray matter structure, and clinical and demographic measures, that most accurately predict future clinical course at the individual subject level. The proposed study also provides a valuable opportunity to inform the field regarding the clinical and functional course and outcome from youth into adulthood in a large, well-characterized sample of people with BD. This is important because the clinical outcome of BD youth in adulthood remains uncertain, as only two studies with a total of 72 subjects followed BD youth into their early twenties. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques will be employed in a representative subsample of COBY participants (n=120), and healthy controls (n=50). Comprehensive assessments of psychopathology and functioning will be collected at the time of neuroimaging, and twice more during the proposed project period in the 120 COBY participants. This proposal accords with the NIMH's mission to define developmental trajectories of mental disorders and develop strategies to better define risk and protective factors for disease trajectories across the lifespan, and with the RDoC initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aim of the proposed study is to identify the impact of long-term previous clinical course and treatment on the brain in individuals with childhood-onset bipolar disorder, and examine how these changes in the brain influence future clinical course during adulthood. The participants are currently between 18-30 years old when the brain begins to achieve full maturity. Thus, this study will provide a unique opportunity to determine the extent to which neuroimaging measures predict future clinical course during an important neurodevelopmental period in individuals with bipolar disorder and can yield findings that will aid treatment decisions for these individuals.",Course and Outcome of Bipolar Disorder in Youth,9890000,R01MH059929,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Exposure to', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'cognitive control', 'comorbidity', 'critical period', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'information processing', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical imaging', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'symptomatology', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,620389,-0.008834772455466159
"Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury Abstract  My career and research interests have centered on the science of movement and factors that maximize mobility. Whether this is through injury prevention, assistive technology, or biomechanical optimization, it is critical to clinical practice that these processes be well understood so that we can provide the most informed patient treatments. In order to carry out more effective clinically-based studies that inform patient care, it is my desire to continue my training through practical experiences with both formal coursework and a oversight by a strong mentoring team in the following domains: (1) activity-based data collection and analysis and (2) use of advanced statistical methods to investigate multiple factors. Through the K23, I will also gain experience specifically focused on my transition to independence; this will include grantsmanship and lab management, leading the design and implementation of clinical and translational studies, management of personnel and meetings, and pursuit of tenure and an R01. This continued training will be completed in the context of a research study that characterizes activity patterns in functional mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI).  Aim 1 of this study is to predict mobility at discharge and at 1-year post-discharge, based upon patient characteristics and activity during IPR. Mobility outcomes can be challenging to predict, particularly for individuals with moderate strength and sensory impairments. Selecting appropriate training is increasingly important with shrinking lengths of stay and there are potential opportunity costs and adverse consequences on quality of life and participation for individuals who do not receive appropriate interventions. Additional activity measures that we can collect early in the IPR stay, by utilizing low-cost sensors, have the potential to provide rich data sets that we can examine to garner insight into outcomes with little administrative burden. Using a machine learning approach, we will investigate patient characteristics and activity-monitoring data to improve predictive models of patient mobility based on data acquired early in the rehab stay. Achieving these aims will improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI to appropriately target expectations and interventions to maximize functional outcomes.  Aim 2 of this proposal is to quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes (i.e., wheeling walking or changes in activity within mode) in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation. There are factors following discharge that challenge or enhance the sustainability of walking for functional mobility including energy costs, neurologic recovery and biopsychosocial factors such as resilience, self-efficacy, environment, and caregiver support. The association between these factors and post-discharge changes in mobility are not well understood. Using wearable sensors we will quantify time spent walking and wheeling to identify transitions between walking and wheeling, identify factors that contribute to these transitions and investigate their impact on participation. Project Narrative In the context of steadily decreasing lengths of stay for inpatient rehabilitation, and in conjunction with therapy caps in outpatient therapy settings that have led to an overall decrease in patient time spent within a clinical context, it is becoming ever more critical that rehabilitation interventions appropriately target functional mobility (walking or wheeling). Unfortunately, the needed data on how mobility changes following discharge and those factors that most accurately predict patient outcomes is lacking. This proposal seeks to improve patient and clinician understanding of anticipated changes in mobility in the year following SCI so that expectations and interventions can be appropriately targeted to maximize functional outcomes through the following aims: (1) predict mobility at 1 year post-discharge based on patient characteristics, biopyschosocial factors, and activity during inpatient rehabilitation and (2) quantitatively evaluate functional mobility changes in the first year post injury and their impact on quality of life and participation.",Characterizing Activity Patterns in Functional Mobility After Spinal Cord Injury,10003374,K23HD096134,"['Address', 'Biomechanics', 'Caregiver support', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Coin', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exertion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinesiology', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personnel Management', 'Physical activity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Secondary to', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Statistical Methods', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biopsychosocial', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'community setting', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'gait rehabilitation', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'injury prevention', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'muscle strength', 'neurological recovery', 'opportunity cost', 'patient mobility', 'person centered', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'research study', 'resilience', 'sensor', 'translational study', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2020,132314,-0.002950855094337813
"Individual differences in dementia spousal caregiver burden: A biobehavioral approach revision Abstract The outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 virus has exasperated the vulnerability of dementia spousal caregivers, as well as those with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias. SARS-Cov-2 is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe respiratory problems and even death. Older adults and people of all ages with underlying comorbidities are considered to be at “high-risk” for severe illness from COVID-19. During this pandemic, dementia spousal caregivers are tasked with the burden of keeping their spouse safe from getting sick and even dying from COVID- 19, while simultaneously performing their typical caregiving responsibilities. The vast majority of dementia spousal caregivers and their spouses with dementia are over sixty-five years of age, the age bracket that puts people at most risk for COVID-19 disease complications and mortality. Social distancing guidelines make up a large proportion of the current prevention recommendations; thus, loneliness and other negative emotions will likely be frequent and more intense than usual. The proposed competitive revision builds upon the primary aims of the parent grant (R01AG062690) by using attachment theory as an overarching theoretical framework to understand dementia spousal caregiver risk and resilience in light of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 disease). The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PA-18-935, NOT-AG-20-022. Capitalizing on the dementia spousal caregivers who will take part in the parent study, we propose to collect additional data for one week each month for three months. We will collect this data using ecological momentary assessment methods, while passively assessing location, activity, autonomic activity, and sleep via smartphone and smartwatch technology. We aim to understand how emotions, assessed in real-time in the natural environment, affect the extent to which AD spousal caregivers adaptively navigate the challenges associated COVID-19. We will also aim to determine how relatively stable individual difference patterns that originate from people’s close relationship histories (i.e., attachment orientations) inform risk and resilience. As an exploratory high risk/high reward aim, we will evaluate if dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches can incorporate passively collected information (i.e., location, heart rate, heart rate variability, activity, sleep) with information that we learn from our primary aims, to yield a detailed and sophisticated understanding of real-world dynamics that predict three critical COVID-19 specific outcomes: social distancing adherence, social distancing self-efficacy, and caregiver self-efficacy. By understanding patterns of risk and resilience, intervention scientists will be better able to identify at-risk AD spousal caregivers. The proposed research would advance our understanding of how AD spousal caregivers can reduce illness exposure for themselves and those they care for in perhaps the most comprehensive, detailed, real-time, real-world investigation of social distancing in AD spousal caregivers to date. Narrative By identifying the factors that impede social distancing behaviors and impair a dementia spousal caregiver’s confidence to provide care, we will be able to design tailored and targeted interventions to reduce risk of COVID- 19 contagion, and improve quality of life for dementia spousal caregivers.",Individual differences in dementia spousal caregiver burden: A biobehavioral approach revision,10201213,R01AG062690,"['2019-nCoV', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'COVID-19', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Homeostasis', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Location', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Social Distance', 'Social Environment', 'Spouse Caregiver', 'Spouses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Virus', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'comorbidity', 'contagion', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'foot', 'heart rate variability', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'interest', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'parent grant', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'risk prediction model', 'smart watch', 'social', 'theories']",NIA,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,493162,-0.09335940950530637
"Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis Abstract Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH that may also translate to other liver diseases. Narrative Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe acute form of alcoholic liver disease with a very high mortality rate. Despite years of research, the standard-of-care and mortality rate has not changed dramatically in over 50 years. Our goal is to develop new computational and experimental methods and discover new biomarkers for AH outcome that can efficiently identify at-risk individuals. A second goal of the project is to identify molecular mechanisms of AH, which could be targeted therapeutically.",Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis,9995661,R01AA028436,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Data', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Production', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supportive care', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Work', 'acute liver injury', 'algorithm development', 'biomarker discovery', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organ injury', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,615104,-0.02125334739715324
"Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater Project Summary / Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a naturally-occurring metal contaminant found in water supplies throughout the world. Although research using small samples (< 400 observations) from Bangladesh, China and Canada suggests that excessive consumption of Mn is neurotoxic in infants and young children, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) classifies Mn only as a secondary contaminant. Thus, Mn is not subject to mandatory monitoring in public water systems, let alone private wells, which serve over 2 million Californians while remaining unregulated and untreated. To reconcile the gap between epidemiological evidence and regulatory action, we propose this timely research. Our project, which takes California’s private wells as a focal point for its investigation, has three specific aims: to identify (1) areas at high risk of exposure to Mn in drinking water (2) the socioeconomic characteristics of communities at high-risk of Mn exposure, and (3) the degree of association between Mn exposure and the health outcomes of infants and young children. While treatment for Mn-contaminated water is technologically straightforward, access may depend on a community’s socioeconomic and political status; thus, there is danger of Mn silently amplifying health inequalities. The ​broader, long-term objectives of this research are (I) to encourage further analyses of Mn exposure in California by developing a statewide publicly-available dataset from groundwater Mn data, and (II) to develop a ​causal ​framework for a primary-sample study of Mn effects on infant and child health. California enforces the US EPA’s secondary contaminant standard of 50 µg L​-1 but only in community water systems. Non-transient, non-community water systems (e.g. schools and hospitals) and private wells are exempt. In recent years, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has found Mn concentrations above the health-based target of 300 µg L​-1 in California’s wells. ​The proposed research will indicate whether and to what extent Mn affects child health and contributes to health disparities. As such, it is aligned with the NIEHS mission to determine how environmental exposures affect humans in order to promote healthier lives. To achieve the first aim of identifying areas at high risk of exposure to unsafe concentrations of Mn, we will use a machine learning model on subsurface flow and groundwater chemistry to predict Mn concentrations in the Central Valley, Los Angeles, Central Coast and West Coast Basins; then, we will overlay the Mn prediction grid with ZIP code and school district polygons to identify the areas that emerge with more than a 50% chance of exposure to Mn at the secondary standard as high-risk. For the second aim, we will determine if high-risk areas are distinguished from low-risk areas by their socioeconomic status and demographics using two-sample t-tests. For the third aim, we will run least squares regressions of birth weight, grade-by-school test scores and chronic absenteeism rates on predicted Mn exposure with controls for chemical confounds, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics. Project Narrative The impact of manganese (Mn) on population health is an under-investigated problem in the United States relative to the wide prevalence and frequent detections of the chemical above safe concentrations in groundwater basins throughout the country. In line with NIEHS priorities to better understand environmental health disparities and to aid in securing environmental justice, we propose to correct this knowledge gap by undertaking a substantial investigation into the prevalence of Mn in California’s private wells, and examining the shared characteristics of communities most likely to be exposed to unsafe levels of manganese in drinking water. By also performing a preliminary investigation of the relationship between Mn exposure and child cognitive health, our study will provide an initial assessment of the public health threat from Mn, highlight the most vulnerable communities, and inform regulatory agencies seeking to review drinking water standards for Mn.",Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater,9978510,R21ES030807,"['Absenteeism', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Bangladesh', 'Birth Weight', 'California', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'China', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disadvantaged', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Esthetics', 'Exposure to', 'Geological Survey', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impaired health', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Micronutrients', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Vital Statistics', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'base', 'contaminated water', 'demographics', 'drinking water', 'econometrics', 'elementary school', 'environmental justice', 'ethnic minority population', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'ground water', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'infant outcome', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'school district', 'socioeconomics', 'web site']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R21,2020,224680,-0.007002787375336346
"A Health Equity Paradigm Shift:   Predictors of Healthy Pregnancy in African American Women ABSTRACT African-American women bear a disproportionate burden of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States, regardless of socio-economic, educational, or marital status. Fortunately, maternal death rarely occurs without warning. Pregnancy complications, such as those that increase the risk of future cardiovascular disease (preterm birth, growth restriction, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes), or severe maternal morbidity (SMM) can serve as sentinel events that herald the impending possibility of a mother's increased risk for maternal mortality (MM). Most health disparities studies to date have used a deficit-based model and have included white women as the reference group to identify detrimental factors. In this supplement, I propose to instead use a strength-based model that utilizes African-American women with healthy pregnancy outcomes as the reference group. I will compare them to African American women with pregnancy complications to identify protective factors because African American women with healthy pregnancies may provide key insight to inform future prevention strategies. The objective of this supplement is to identify environmental, systems, behavioral, medical, and biological constructs that predict a healthy, uncomplicated pregnancy in African- American women. The proposed supplemental study leverages a rich repository of clinical, survey and biospecimen data from a contemporary cohort of 852 African American women enrolled in an observational preterm birth study from 2017-2020, 549 (64%) of whom went on to have a healthy pregnancy, free from complications that predict future cardiovascular disease. I will use two complementary approaches, multi-level modeling and machine learning, to quantify the relative contributions of modifiable protective factors to a healthy pregnancy across multiple levels and domains of influence. Using an adaptation of the National Institute on Minority Health Disparities Research Framework, I will identify factors that protect African-American women from pregnancy complications that predict future cardiovascular disease (Aim 1.1), SMM (Aim 1.2), and a composite morbidity index combining the two (Aim 1.3). Finally, the work of interpreting the empirical findings from Aim 1, to develop potential interventions and policy changes, will begin in Aim 2. This aim is aspirational in nature, but included in this brief supplement to stress the importance of identifying actionable items from study findings of protective factors that are most amenable to targeting through interventions and/or health policy. A team of diverse stakeholders, including a Maternal Advisory Panel of African American Mothers, Clinicians, and Perinatal Researchers will use intervention mapping (a rigorous method that has been used to create behavioral health interventions) to review study findings, methodically think through ways to translate study findings into action, and make recommendations for future directions that are most likely to promote health equity for African American mothers. 1 NARRATIVE Most health disparities studies that have attempted to identify factors that explain the higher rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortality among African-American women have used a deficit-based model and included white women as the reference group to identify detrimental factors. In this supplement, I propose to instead use a strength-based model that utilizes African American women with healthy pregnancies as the reference group to identify protective factors that can be targeted through the design of future interventions to promote health equity. 1",A Health Equity Paradigm Shift:   Predictors of Healthy Pregnancy in African American Women,10200462,K23HD095075,"['Acute', 'African American', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Educational Status', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health Promotion', 'Hematology', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Life Experience', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Policies', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Factor', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Proxy', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secure', 'Sentinel', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Ursidae Family', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'behavioral health intervention', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'early pregnancy', 'health disparity', 'health equity', 'health goals', 'healthy pregnancy', 'indexing', 'insight', 'maternal morbidity', 'maternal risk', 'minority health', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnant', 'protective factors', 'racism', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'respiratory', 'severe maternal morbidity', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'working group']",NICHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,162000,-0.0020832617642430966
"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",9955368,K08MH120341,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Partnership Practice', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Services', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'chatbot', 'comorbidity', 'computer program', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health service use', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'multiphase optimization strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'service delivery', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'success', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web site']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,179096,-0.03070063679283706
"CHABMAP (Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom Mapping and Analyses Platform) technology automates the quantification of toxic CyanoHABs exposure epochs for any waterbody.

"Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence ABSTRACT  Interventions in clinical settings, such as the emergency department (ED), are an opportunity for interpersonal firearm violence prevention, particularly among youth, whom interpersonal firearm violence disproportionately affects. A crucial prerequisite to successful clinical interventions is an accurate gauge of risk, to ensure the judicious allocation of scarce resources; providing that missing prerequisite is the primary goal of the proposed work. Machine learning methods, in contrast to traditional inferential statistical models, are distinguished by their emphasis on prospective prediction, and have enhanced clinical prediction in several fields, including heart disease, cancer diagnosis and outcomes, PTSD, suicide risk, and substance use, among others. Yet, with the exception of the SAFETY score—developed by the current investigative team—machine learning methods have not been leveraged to prospectively predict firearm violence. In this proposed work our research objectives are two-fold: 1) Externally validate the SAFETY score by determining its ability to predict firearm violence involvement within the next year on a new data set; and 2) Improve the SAFETY score by conducting a comparative analysis of four powerful machine learning methods: elastic net penalized logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and boosting (ensemble) methods. In this way, we are responding to Objective One: Research to help inform the development of innovative and promising opportunities to enhance safety and prevent firearm-related injuries, deaths, and crime. This approach is innovative because it builds upon the only work to apply machine learning methods to firearm violence prediction, and it is a promising opportunity to prevent firearm injuries because it will a) provide an explicit gauge of future firearm violence risk; and b) characterize risk factor effects in terms of their prospective prediction ability, unlike any prior research. Thus this research will both identify individuals in most need of intervention, and also point to potentially modifiable predictive factors. Properly addressing this research question in a generalizable way requires a contemporary data set with 1) a focus on a high-need, yet broad, study population; 2) comprehensive baseline measures that provide a broad basis for prediction; and 3) geographic variability (Midwest, West Coast, and East Coast) that enhances generalizability. Thus, we will recruit 1,500 youth age 18-24 from urban EDs in three broadly different locales—Flint, Philadelphia, and Seattle—and administer a baseline survey covering several domains of potential risk factors for future violence, and follow up with those youth at 6- and 12-months to ascertain the primary outcome—firearm violence involvement (as victim or perpetrator)—as well as the secondary outcomes: high-risk firearm behaviors, non-firearm violence, and violent injury. Because this work requires a prospective longitudinal study, we are applying for Option B. This work will lay the ground for future research involving the development and testing of interventions for interpersonal firearm violence both by identifying potential high- leverage modifiable predictive factors, and by identifying youth most in need of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The purpose of the proposed work is to harness cutting-edge machine learning methods to optimize prediction of future firearm violence so that prevention resources can be allocated efficiently. In service to that goal, we will recruit participants age 18-24 from three urban emergency departments, administer a comprehensive assessment, and use the measurements taken there to predict firearm violence over the following year. The proposed work will provide generalizable knowledge on what factors are most predictive of future firearm violence, which will contribute to future intervention strategies both in terms of content and in terms of optimally determining which people require intervention.",Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence,10162695,R01CE003294,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,649991,-0.014473602773913243
"Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY Psychopathology is a very serious public health burden that not only affects adults, but also many children and adolescents. To better understand this devastating problem, the scientific community has focused its efforts on pinpointing the earliest developmental origins of psychopathology. A considerable literature now implicates prenatal stress as a critical determinant of poor psychological functioning in childhood and beyond. However, knowledge about whether the timing of prenatal stress differentially influences the development of child psychopathology is virtually unknown. Gaining such knowledge is the long-term goal of our research. This proposed project “piggybacks” on our current RO1-funded project (NICHD grant # R01HD085990) that is following a cohort of 335 women oversampled for life stress, with data collection starting at pregnancy week 15 until 6 months postpartum. We are conducting a granular assessment of pregnancy stress (measured weekly by maternal report) with the goal of understanding critical periods during fetal life when stress derails later infant behavioral and physiological stress responsivity. The overall objective of this new RO1 project is to follow this cohort into the child's preschool years. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will determine how the differential timing of prenatal stress influences behavior problems and psychopathology measured at age 4, how differences in self-regulation (an important precursor of mental health functioning) mediates the relationship between prenatal stress and psychopathology at age 4, and how these relationships differ between boys and girls. Aim 2 will test a host of postnatal risk factors (e.g., poor maternal mental health, poverty, intimate partner violence) and resilience factors (e.g., sensitive parenting, coping skills) as moderators of the effects of timing of prenatal stress on behavior problems and psychopathology at age 4. Importantly and uniquely, postnatal stress (mother and child) is assessed also in a fine-grained manner by every 3 month assessments from age 6 mos to 4 years. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use an exploratory statistical approach, machine learning, to detect which relatively small epochs of stress in postnatal life (measured every 3 months) interact with small epochs of prenatal stress to maximally influence child behavior problems and psychopathology. This project is innovative in its highly multimethod approach (e.g., behavioral observation, salivary analytes, laboratory tasks), its granular assessment of chronic and episodic prenatal and postnatal stressors, and the novel statistical approaches used to determine which epochs of stress are most relevant for psychopathology. This highly significant research will be the first longitudinal, prospective, multi-method study of how differential timing of prenatal stress influences the development of psychopathology, as mediated by child self-regulation and moderated by postnatal environmental factors. Thus, this study is critical for understanding how early child development sets the stage for psychopathology and will lead to increased understanding of the developmental epochs to be targeted for preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prenatal stress has devastating effects on children's neurobehavioral development, including elevating the risk for mental health disorders. What remains virtually unknown, however, is how the differential timing of prenatal stress affects the risk for later psychopathology, how this risk is mediated by children's capacity to self-regulate, and the role of the postnatal family environment in exacerbating or reducing this risk. The proposed study will provide essential information about how the timing of prenatal stress, child regulatory capacity, and the postnatal environment interact to increase risk for emerging psychopathology, which will inform strategies for developing and implementing interventions to prevent poor mental health and other negative child outcomes.",Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology,10048200,R01HD100469,"['4 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Preschool Child', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Salivary', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Stress', 'System', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavior observation', 'biobehavior', 'boys', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'early childhood', 'executive function', 'externalizing behavior', 'fetal', 'girls', 'innovation', 'intimate partner violence', 'maternal stress', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'sex', 'stress reactivity', 'stressor', 'virtual']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,675471,-0.005068267422312869
"Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort Project summary Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the utility of ultrasound for OA assessment, standardize its acquisition and scoring, and promote increased uptake of US for use in clinical, research, and trial settings. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent and frequently debilitating. Development of potential treatments has been hampered by the heterogenous nature of this common chronic condition, which is characterized by a number of subgroups, or phenotypes, with different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Imaging, genetics, biochemical biomarkers, and other features can be used to characterize phenotypes, but variations in data types can make it difficult to harmonize definitions. While radiography is widely used in KOA imaging, it is limited in its ability to assess early disease (when interventions are most likely to succeed) and is insensitive to change. Ultrasound (US) is a widely accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective imaging modality that can provide detailed and reliable information about all joint tissues (e.g., cartilage, meniscus, synovium, bone), and could therefore inform phenotypes in KOA (e.g., by presence of synovitis, effusion, cartilage damage, calcium crystal deposition, and popliteal cysts). Use of US is currently limited by the lack of systematically performed studies in well-characterized non-clinical populations. To address this gap and further the use of this advantageous imaging modality for KOA, we will obtain standardized US and radiography in the population- based Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), the new enrollment phase of the 25+ year Johnston County OA Project which includes white, African American, and Hispanic men and women aged 35-70, to achieve three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the population prevalence (n~3000) of knee US features including cartilage and meniscal damage, synovitis/effusion, calcium crystal deposition, popliteal cysts and osteophytes overall and in key subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and symptom status. Aim 2 will allow quantification of the associations between these US features and radiographic findings and symptom scores overall and in key subgroups (e.g., those with and without radiographic KOA, by sex, by race/ethnicity). For Aim 3, we will apply novel machine learning methodologies (e.g., Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, Joint and Individual Variation [JIVE], and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]) to a) develop an overall US score for symptomatic KOA and b) identify the contribution of US variables to phenotypes relevant to KOA based on general health, physical activity, and functional assessments. This study is a crucial step to establish the foundation for US as an assessment tool for clinical use, research, and clinical trials in KOA, providing unique population-based cross-sectional data regarding the utility of US and forming the basis for future longitudinal work evaluating its value and performance characteristics related to incident and progressive KOA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem that, like many other chronic conditions, is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. Ultrasound is an accessible, time-efficient, and cost-effective imaging modality that provides invaluable data about all joint tissues involved in osteoarthritis and has the potential to identify important phenotypes. The proposed work is relevant to the NIAMS mission and represents a crucial step to establish the foundation for ultrasound as an assessment tool for use in clinics, research, and clinical trials in osteoarthritis.",Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort,9944803,R01AR077060,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Spur', 'Calcium', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Claustrophobias', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'County', 'Crystal Formation', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Popliteal Cyst', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Synovitis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effusion', 'follow-up', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'men', 'novel', 'point of care', 'population based', 'recruit', 'rheumatologist', 'sex', 'uptake']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,342100,-0.016786143919437772
"Malaria Operations Research to Improve Malaria Control and Reduce Morbidity and Mortality in Western Kenya Project summary This application is for the fourth, 5-year CoAG between CDC’s Malaria Branch and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). Activities take place in western Kenya under the umbrella of the long-term collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), CDC, and LSTM and benefit from LSTM’s existing infrastructure in Kenya. The research strategy follows the 5 objectives of the NOFO. The first objective involves the expansion in 2020/21 of the epidemiological (1.1) and entomological surveillance (1.2) platform to track progress towards malaria transmission reduction targets following the introduction of population-wide interventions in 2021/22. To maintain low transmission status, this requires a shift from the existing periodic, district-level surveillance to systems where surveillance itself becomes an intervention and can detect individual geo-located cases near real-time for rapid notification and foci investigation. We will support the Kenyan Ministry of Health (MoH) with their goal to digitise the data collected on their paper-based health registers using software that makes them scannable (1.1.5). This will include registers that capture case-burden data used in out-patient departments (1.1.6) and by community health workers as part of integrated community case management (ICCM) (1.1.7), and antenatal clinic registers that capture malaria infection prevalence during first antenatal clinic visits. This is a novel method to track the asymptomatic parasite reservoir in populations (1.1.8). Combined, this allows, for the first time, sustainable, daily, near real-time surveillance to track progress towards malaria transmission reduction targets. We will also conduct continuous malaria indicator household surveys (cMIS) to track malaria prevalence and intervention coverage (1.1.9) and entomological monitoring (1.2), both using adaptive sampling frameworks that can respond to challenges related to rapid changes in malaria transmission. As part of the second objective, we will implement population-wide interventions targeting malaria transmission, starting in 2021/22. The optimal combination of novel or improved interventions will be developed in close collaboration with CDC in 2020/21. This is likely to include enhanced case- management using digitally supported quality improvement approaches of ICCM, enhanced vector control with larval source management and insecticide-treated piperonyl butoxide (PBO) nets, and mass drug administration with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and ivermectin targeting the asymptomatic parasite reservoir (2.1). The third objective involves assessing the safety effectiveness of currently deployed antimalarials for the prevention (3.2.1) and treatment (3.2 and 3.3) of malaria in the context of increasing antimalarial drug resistance. We will liaise with CDC’s laboratories in Atlanta for the molecular monitoring of drug resistance. The fourth objective aims to maximise the public health impact by supporting the creation of a knowledge centre at the KEMRI’s CGHR for evidence synthesis and information exchange to enhance the translation of global malaria control policies (4). Objective 5 involves the strengthening of research capacity of the partners in Kenya by the provision of internships (5.1) and MSc, PhD and post-doctoral studentships and research leadership mentoring (5.1). PROJECT NARRATIVE This CoAg supports a collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), the US CDC and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) to support the Kenyan Ministry of Health to achieve major reductions in the malaria burden in areas with intense year-round transmission in western Kenya by 2025. The partnership will support the expansion of the malaria surveillance infrastructure to track the progress towards malaria transmission targets, evaluate different combinations of area-wide interventions targeting the malaria vector and asymptomatic parasite reservoir to reduce malaria transmission and strengthen case management. These activities will provide pivotal critical scientific knowledge to inform and guide malaria program implementation and reduce malaria-associated morbidity and mortality through the identification and scale-up and continued evaluation of evidence-based intervention strategies.",Malaria Operations Research to Improve Malaria Control and Reduce Morbidity and Mortality in Western Kenya,10126073,U01GH002290,[' '],CGH,TMLIVERPOOL SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE,U01,2020,550000,-0.020613909387168543

"Concussion and Driving Skills in the Young Driver PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research Objectives. This prospective cohort study rigorously examines the neurocognitive impact of concussion on simulated and real-world driving performance among young drivers aged 16-24 years. Importance. Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving. Unlike new “Return to Learn” guidelines, there are no evidence-based “Return to Drive” guidelines for when individuals with concussion may be safe to return to driving. Objectives. Conduct a prospective matched cohort study to explore the risk of concussion in simulated and real-world driving conditions. We propose three specific aims and a fourth exploratory aim:  (i) Examine whether concussion negatively impacts simulated driving performance among young  drivers, relative to a cohort of young drivers without concussion.  (ii) Determine whether simulated driving task performance correlates with recovery from  concussion symptoms and signs in the month following concussion, relative to young drivers  without recent concussion.  (iii) Measure the impact of concussion and recovery on real-world driving exposure and performance.  (iv) [Exploratory] Examine whether concussion symptoms and neuropsychometric impairment are  associated with higher rates of driving citations or reported crashes. Study design. Prospective controlled matched cohort study. Setting/participants. 50 drivers with recent concussion; 50 age/gender matched controls aged 16-25 years. Study protocol. Concussion participants will be recruited within two weeks of concussion. Case and control participants will complete 1) driving risk survey; 2) neuropsychological testing an 3) simulated driving tasks at baseline and 1 month. Commercially available monitoring technology will record risky driving for 3 months Outcome measures. (i) simulated driving risk scores; (ii) real world driving risk scores (rapid braking, rapid acceleration, speeding); (iii) reported citations and crash rates. Impact. This study will have a significant population health impact in elucidating the neurocognitive sequelae of recent concussion on driving. Results will inform return to safe driving among young drivers with concussion.

"Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this, PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project 2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system. Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000 data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning, and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report- back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reproductive health has been at the forefront of Puerto Ricans’ health concerns as rates of preterm birth and infant mortality in Puerto Rico are among the highest of all U.S. states and territories. The PROTECT SRC is exploring the link between exposure to a mixture of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Puerto Rico, and is working to reduce that exposure. Improved understanding of the link between adverse pregnancy outcomes and contamination, together with developing sustainable technologies to reduce risk, will help improve health outcomes in Puerto Rico (a disadvantaged population) and beyond.",Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT),9839906,P42ES017198,"['Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Floods', 'Geographic state', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Hurricane', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infrastructure', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxidative Stress Pathway', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pesticides', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health Practice', 'Puerto Rican', 'Puerto Rico', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Superfund', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Water', 'Water Purification', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'community involvement', 'contaminant transport', 'contaminated drinking water', 'contaminated water', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'disadvantaged population', 'drinking water', 'experience', 'extreme weather', 'ground water', 'health data', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'new technology', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'portability', 'prenatal', 'recruit', 'remediation', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'sound', 'superfund chemical', 'superfund site', 'tissue culture', 'toxicant', 'volatile organic compound', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,P42,2020,2414074,-0.001413454880439511
"MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (COD) are common in the United States and providers have been challenged to provide effective treatments. As a consequence, their clients with COD may experience poor treatment engagement, symptom exacerbation and cycle in and out of emergency services. This is particularly true for underrepresented populations with a COD including individuals whom are homeless and involved in the criminally justice system. Research shows that integrated and coordinated community- based services for COD can improve client outcomes. However, healthcare workforce has a gap in training staff on such treatment techniques, which we aim to close via this Phase II STTR project.  Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is a unique evidence-based, trans-disciplinary treatment designed to address the complex needs of individuals with CODs and includes manuals for high risk populations of civilian and veteran homeless individuals as well as those involved in the criminally justice system. Listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration-Registry for Evidence Based Practices (NREPP), MISSION has had substantial impact. The Veterans Health Administration has deployed it in their national plan to end Veteran Homelessness. Massachusetts has used it in its Statewide Plan to End Homelessness and written it into Public Law for delivery alongside Veterans Treatment courts. While MISSION is a manualized treatment, a recent multisite implementation study identified the need for more comprehensive training tools. With NIAAA support, the University of Massachusetts Medical School (MISSION developers) partnered with Praxis on a Phase I STTR to (1) develop the MISSION University online training platform, (2) show proof of concept by implementing two training modules and an e-simulation case study, and (3) conduct a pilot randomized trial which demonstrated that training-as-usual Distance Learning (DL) + Technical Assistance (TA) outperformed TA alone.  In Phase II, we will complete MISSION U by developing and testing five new MISSION modules and companion e-simulations tools that test knowledge acquisition and application. We will first do a formative evaluation with 20 learners who will provide feedback on MISSION U modules. This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial similar to Phase I in which 60 learners will be randomized to the DL or the DL+TA conditions. In preparation for future scalability, we will uniquely conduct a qualitative process evaluation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework with 42 MISSION U participants to look at facilitators and barriers to implementation. Lastly, we will pilot test machine learning techniques with our 60 individuals who participated in the randomized trial in an effort to help personalize the MISSION U training experience for commercialization. !1 “MISSION U: A Multimedia Training Tool for Treatment of Individuals with Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders” is aimed at training providers of services for these individuals. MISSION U challenges prevailing provider training methodology that relies mainly on on-site provider training and/or online training using typical classroom-type materials. This project not only addresses the growing need for new provider training methodologies, but also offers the promise of improving clinical efficacy and reducing training costs and medical expenditures overall.! !",MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS,9942350,R42AA026751,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Assertiveness', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Community Outreach', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distance Learning', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency medical service', 'England', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based program', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laws', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Multimedia', 'National Health Services', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pre-Post Tests', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Videoconferences', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical efficacy', 'commercialization', 'community based service', 'computer science', 'cost', 'court', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'field study', 'formative assessment', 'health administration', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'outreach', 'peer', 'peer support', 'phase I trial', 'programs', 'prototype', 'provider networks', 'randomized trial', 'satisfaction', 'service providers', 'simulation', 'skills', 'sobriety', 'suicidal risk', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIAAA,"PRAXIS, INC.",R42,2020,738169,-0.016064322960236067
"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life. Project Narrative Bipolar disorder typically begins in adolescence; recurrent mood symptoms during this period can have a devastating impact on a person's ability to achieve a high quality of life. Digital phenotyping, defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors, may make it possible to better understand and predict the onset of mood symptoms with minimal burden to the individual.

"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,10266768,K99HD096125,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Childbirth', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Ductal Epithelial Cell', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Excretory function', 'Failure', 'Fetal Mortality Statistics', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Nephrons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Organ', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'associated symptom', 'biobank', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'early onset', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney dysfunction', 'maternal serum', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pregnancy disorder', 'premature', 'prevent', 'response', 'stillbirth', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'uptake', 'urinary']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2020,60858,-0.04535874275961073
"Identifying Pathways Between Daily Stress and Long-Term Well-Being in Caregivers and Non-Caregivers Stressful experiences are generally thought to be harmful to mental and physical health. This perspective has guided research, informed policy, and colored the public narrative on the effects of caregiving for an impaired older adult. Indeed, many studies find greater depression, higher negative affect, and lower life satisfaction in caregivers (CGs) relative to non-caregivers (non-CGs).1,2 However, there is evidence that CGs experience positive effects despite, or perhaps because of, their stressful experiences.3 Research also finds that CGs live longer and are more resilient to perceived stress than non-CGs.4,5 Moreover, many CGs report psychological benefits like increased meaning in life, growing closer to the care recipient, and learning new skills.6,7 In a previous paper,8 the PI (Marino) suggested that these benefits reflect domains of eudaimonic well-being (EWB - meaning in life, positive relationships, personal growth, environmental mastery, autonomy, and self- acceptance) developed in positive psychology research9. Longitudinal change in EWB among CGs of impaired older adults has not yet been studied. Higher EWB has also been linked to lower reactivity to stressors,10,11 but has not been evaluated as an internal resource that promotes CGs' resilience to daily stress. The proposed project will fill these gaps by examining links between caregiving status and multiple dimensions of well-being including EWB, hedonic well-being (HWB - positive and negative affect and life satisfaction), and affective and physiological reactivity to daily stress. We will obtain a sample of propensity-matched CGs and non-CGs from the main survey of the population-based Midlife in the United States study and its daily diary study (the National Study of Daily Experiences) to identify within- and between- group differences in 1) EWB and HWB, cross- sectionally and over 20 years, and 2) exposure and reactivity to stressors over 8 days. In an exploratory aim, we will apply novel machine learning techniques to identify diverse conditions associated with typologies of optimal and sub-optimal well-being. The central hypothesis is that despite being associated with persistently lower HWB, caregiving for an impaired older adult is linked to greater increases in EWB over time. Further, longitudinal gains in EWB are predicted to weaken the association between stressor exposure and reactivity to daily stressors in CGs. The project is expected to help shift the current CG well-being paradigm by applying robust methods from developmental psychology to the caregiving context and generating novel information about how caring for an aging adult might affect well-being both negatively and positively, concurrently and over time. Findings can inform new psychological interventions that target EWB as a pathway to increasing resilience to daily stressors. The proposed training site will provide a scientific environment that is challenging and strongly supportive of the proposed project. Upon completion of the training plan, the PI will have a unique and diversified skill set for evaluating several domains of stress and well-being across time scales and will be prepared to lead future independent investigations to understand and promote positive outcomes among stress-prone adults like CGs. The proposed research will help identify both positive and negative effects of providing care to an impaired older adult and provide insight into caregivers' resilience to daily stressful experiences. As more adults become caregivers for an aging population, strategies are needed to optimize the short- and long-term effects of providing care. Thus, the proposed project is essential for the design of interventions that work towards NIA's mission of improving the health of older persons.",Identifying Pathways Between Daily Stress and Long-Term Well-Being in Caregivers and Non-Caregivers,10068660,F31AG066434,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver well-being', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic stress', 'Color', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disabled Children', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perception', 'Personal Growth', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Stress and Coping', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Typology', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'affective disturbance', 'aging population', 'care recipients', 'caregiving', 'caregiving outcomes', 'caregiving research', 'developmental psychology', 'diaries', 'experience', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'men', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'multilevel analysis', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'perceived stress', 'person centered', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'population survey', 'pre-doctoral', 'psychologic', 'research data dissemination', 'resilience', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'stressor', 'therapy design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,F31,2020,36231,-0.08288341526666064
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9988193,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental arm', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'weight loss program', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2020,771233,-0.017066100011731485
"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation.

"Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults ABSTRACT  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors disproportionately affect black adults, and these disparities are evident early in the life course. Genetic factors do not appear to explain this difference, and studies have increasingly implicated socioeconomic risk factors. Among the most prominent risk factors for racial disparities in CVD is educational attainment, which is strongly correlated with smoking, hypertension, and CVD over the life course. Yet it is unclear which aspects of schooling are most salient. One possible explanation for racial disparities in CVD is that black youth often attend highly racially segregated schools. Segregation is thought to be linked with CVD due to increased stress and discrimination; social norms and peer influence; and the constraining of socioeconomic opportunities that reduces income and healthcare access later in life. Yet despite the fact that school segregation has increased in recent years, there are no studies examining the effects of recent school segregation trends on CVD risk factors. The goal of this study is to provide this urgently needed evidence. In particular, we take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on the effects of education on CVD. Since 1990, numerous local court decisions have resulted in “resegregation” in school districts across the country. We link nationwide data on these court decisions and school district-level measures of school segregation with CVD outcome data from two large nationally representative U.S. cohort studies of affected youth: the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health, N≈90,000) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N≈8,000). We employ the quasi-experimental technique of instrumental variables analysis, which reduces typical confounding by factors such as unobserved individual and family characteristics. In Aim 1, our goal is to estimate the short- term effects of school segregation on CVD risk factors—including smoking, physical activity, obesity, and mental health—among youth while they are still in school. In Aim 2, we will examine the long-term effects of school segregation in the decades that follow, with outcomes including those in Aim 1 in addition to objectively measured CVD biomarkers, diabetes, and hypertension. We will also undertake exploratory analyses to determine possible mediating pathways. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of CVD risk factors differs in response to school racial segregation. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of school racial segregation on CVD risk factors, helping to inform school-based, clinical, and community interventions to reduce persistent and inequitable racial disparities in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the short-term and long-term effects of school racial segregation on risk factors for heart disease. We will also assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to school segregation.

"Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans Chronic dysregulation of physiological systems manifests systemically as allostatic load (AL) and in abnormal stress reactivity profiles, which are features of psychopathological conditions that increase future disease risk. But the biological basis underlying inter-individual differences in stress regulation and reactivity remains unknown. Even among populations of healthy individuals exposed to standardized laboratory challenges, such as the Trier social stress test (TSST), there are substantial differences in the magnitude of responses in multiple physiological systems, including but not limited to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and cardiovascular system, metabolic changes, and immune and pro-inflammatory systems. One common factor to all stress systems is their dependence on energy supply, which fuels every aspect of the stress response including molecular, cellular, systemic and cognitive/psychological functioning. At the cellular level, energy is provided by mitochondria, unique organelles that populate the cell cytoplasm and contain their own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), that is essential to mitochondrial health. MtDNA defects cause dysregulation of multiple aspects of mitochondrial structure and function, known as mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL). Three main lines of evidence suggest that MAL contributes to AL and regulates stress responses in humans: i) we recently discovered that the mtDNA is released following psychological stress in humans (PNEC 2019), ii) experimentally-induced MAL in animals caused specific alterations in the multisystem physiological responses to psychological stress (PNAS 2015), and iii) mitochondria are the source of stress hormones, including cortisol that is synthesized in mitochondria within the adrenal glands (Nat Genetics 2012). Together, this evidence suggests that MAL may alter both baseline AL and stress reactivity profiles, potentially providing new insight into the source of interindividual differences in stress regulation and health in general. In this project, we perform the first comprehensive assessment of MAL, systemic AL, multisystem stress reactivity to a laboratory challenge (TSST) in three groups of individuals who have rare genetic mtDNA defects that selectively causes different forms of MAL and in a healthy control group. Multisystem stress biomarker profiling under fasting baseline and stress reactive conditions will provide a comprehensive test of pathways linking MAL to stress physiology in humans. The resulting high-dimensionality data will be treated using integrative data analytic approaches and classifying algorithms, including cross-validated machine learning models, to identify resting and stress-reactive biomarker signatures responsive to MAL. In parallel, assessments of executive function and key domains of psychosocial functioning including mood, stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and well-being will contribute to provide a comprehensive picture of novel mitochondrial psychobiological pathways. NARRATIVE There are large unexplained inter-individual differences in systemic allostatic load and stress reactivity, which may in part be explained by mitochondria. Here we study the effects of chronic dysregulation of mitochondrial function – mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL) – on multisystem stress regulation in humans. This project will establish the influence of MAL on baseline AL as well as multisystem stress reactivity profiles, defining novel psychobiological pathways by which mitochondria may contribute to the maintenance of health and resilience, and to disease risk.",Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans,9947362,R01MH122706,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Cytoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Energy Supply', 'Esthesia', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fasting', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gatekeeping', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hematology', 'Hormones', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'IL6 gene', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammatory', 'Inherited', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Ploidies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Respiratory Chain', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trier Social Stress Test', 'allostatic load', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cognitive function', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'executive function', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'negative affect', 'negative mood', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'stress reactivity', 'trait', 'urinary']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,815629,-0.007028130645860718
"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9894798,R00ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'social epidemiology', 'social factors', 'social vulnerability', 'tool']",NIEHS,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,249000,-0.05798738846657969
"Refinement of a rapid saliva miRNA diagnostic test for concussion Summary/Abstract - Quadrant Biosciences is developing a new diagnostic to aid in the clinical detection of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in school-aged children and young adults (13–22 years). Based on salivary microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers, Quadrant’s diagnostic will provide an accurate, objective, and non-invasive method for mTBI diagnosis. Such a method is critically needed, as the number of pediatric mTBIs is on the rise, and the developing brains of young patients are more vulnerable to the after-effects of mechanical forces, leading to a wide range of negative effects on physical, cognitive, and psychological function. The diagnosis and assessment of mTBI in adolescents are challenging and rely on subjective measures, leading many mTBIs to go undiagnosed or underreported. This results in suboptimal post-injury treatment and patient management. A biologic assay to accurately diagnose adolescent mTBI would therefore provide an invaluable guide for clinical care, potentially guiding decisions for imaging, return to play, return to school, and therapeutic interventions. While a number of potential biomarkers for objectively detecting mTBI have been proposed, including the blood biomarkers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1), recent research questions the ability of blood-based biomarkers to differentiate patients with mTBI from those with acute orthopedic trauma, particularly in pediatric populations. Moreover, these assays require venipuncture expertise that is not always available, particularly in the case of sports-related concussions, which account for nearly 1/3 of mTBIs in this patient population. To address these shortcomings, Quadrant Biosciences is creating a novel, objective diagnostic tool based on a panel of saliva miRNA biomarkers that are differentially expressed in patients with mTBI. Pilot studies in over 200 individuals with mTBI have identified a panel of saliva miRNAs capable of diagnosing mTBI and predicting symptom duration. In the proposed Fast Track project, Quadrant will advance development of this test by establishing a rapid, accurate method for quantifying these miRNAs and refining/validating a diagnostic algorithm to differentiate adolescents and young adults with mTBI from peers with symptomology that mimics mTBI (e.g. chronic headaches, anxiety/depression, ADHD, exercise-related fatigue, and orthopedic injury). In Phase I, Quadrant will refine a diagnostic algorithm for mTBI using a rapid quantification technique for saliva miRNAs. Machine learning will be used to develop a diagnostic algorithm that employs miRNA levels from the rapid multiplex assay alongside participant medical and demographic characteristics to predict mTBI status. In Phase II, Quadrant will validate the diagnostic algorithm for differentiating mTBI from medical conditions with overlapping symptomology in a prospective, case-control study of 2500 adolescents and young adults (age 13–22 years) to refine the saliva-based diagnostic aid for mTBI. Ultimately, Quadrant’s proposed salivary miRNA-based test will yield a minimally invasive, objective, biologic test that can aid diagnosis of mTBI, including among patients with confounding psychologic conditions. Narrative - Children and adolescents account for approximately 2/3 of the 3 million concussions that occur in the U.S. each year, placing them at risk for negative impacts on physical, cognitive, and psychological function, including poor academic performance, behavior, social interactions, and reduced subsequent employment. Unfortunately, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is underdiagnosed due to the poor sensitivity of conventional methods (neurological assessment, self-reporting, imaging, etc.) and lack of an objective, non-invasive diagnostic tool. Quadrant Biosciences’ rapid, accurate, objective aid for the diagnosis of mTBIs in adolescents and young adults will enable timely and accurate decision-making in mTBI assessment, resulting in reduced re- injury/morbidity, individualized patient management, and improved long-term patient outcomes.",Refinement of a rapid saliva miRNA diagnostic test for concussion,10081522,R42NS119119,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Headaches', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Emergency department visit', 'Employment', 'Exercise', 'Fatigue', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Headache', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Olfactory Nerve', 'Oral cavity', 'Orthopedics', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein C', 'RNA Sequences', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Sports', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Venipunctures', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'aging population', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical care', 'concussive symptom', 'design', 'diagnostic panel', 'differential expression', 'improved', 'mechanical force', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'minimally invasive', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'peer', 'personalized management', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase', 'young adult']",NINDS,"QUADRANT BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R42,2020,380848,-0.020891818188519172
"Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) are at increased risk for numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, substance use, HIV/AIDS, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Despite clear documentation and replication of these health disparities, relatively little is known about their development from adolescence into adulthood. Two theories primarily dominate the literature. Minority stress models describe unique life stressors experienced only by sexual minorities (e.g., victimization and discrimination based on sexual orientation) as primary contributors to health disparities. Other models implicate both minority stress and normative psychosocial processes together as contributors to health disparities. Some such normative processes include (1) psychological adjustment and characteristics (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, substance use expectancies), (2) disrupted social systems (e.g., family, peers, school), and (3) individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, temperament). To date, most studies of both minority stress and normative processes are limited by use of cross-sectional samples of primarily Caucasian adults. Although much has been learned from these studies, they do not permit analysis of emerging health disparities across development. Existing research is therefore limited in terms of both generalizability to diverse populations, and validity of directionality inferences between observed ‘predictors’ and ‘outcomes’. My long-term career goals are to identify mechanisms leading to disparities among sexual minorities, with the goal of improving treatments for these disparities, and to develop screening tools to identify high-risk youth who would benefit from prevention programs. To reach this goal, in this project, I address existing limitations to the literature using a prospective sample of individuals who were 14-19 years old at baseline and followed for over 4 years. My goal is to describe developmental trajectories and mechanisms of health disparity development for sexual minority youth compared with heterosexual youth across a 10-year developmental window spanning ages 14- 23 years. Longitudinal outcomes include depression/anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, sleep, general physical health, disordered eating and substance use. Developmental trajectories for these outcomes will be charted by gender and sexual orientation. Confirmatory analyses based on existing literature will be conducted to examine relations between minority stress and adverse outcomes. Then, I will use machine learning to identify as-yet unknown predictors of adverse outcomes and health disparities and characterize any changes in prediction across time. Finally, I will use state-of-the art intervening variable analyses (mediation, moderation) to evaluate longitudinal mechanisms through which health disparities emerge. Findings should provide insight into mechanisms of disparity development and maintenance, informing prevention and intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) experience wide-ranging disparities in mental and physical health that often persist into adulthood, yet little is known about development of these disparities. This research (1) examines developmental trajectories in mental and physical health outcomes from adolescence to young adulthood among sexual minority and matched heterosexual youth, (2) uses advanced statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to identify hypothesized and currently unknown factors that predict disparities over time, and (3) elucidates pathways to adversity and resilience. Experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual youth and young adults will be compared to uncover possible differences in developmental experiences that lead to health disparities, with possible implications for prevention and intervention among a highly vulnerable population.",Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing,9929425,F31MD014052,"['19 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Asthma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Documentation', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expectancy', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterosexuals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spirituality', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Victimization', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'emerging adult', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'non-heterosexual', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer victimization', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'resilience', 'sexual identity', 'sexual minority', 'sexual risk behavior', 'social', 'social factors', 'stressor', 'substance misuse', 'theories', 'treatment disparity', 'young adult']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,33937,-0.002612342632569532
"Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease that affects 39% of adults in the U.S. Obesity rates are disproportionately rising among women and contribute to increasing rates of diabetes and CV mortality among women younger than 55 years. Pregnancy represents a life transition when many women gain excess weight. The effect of obesity is further magnified in women with preeclampsia, an independent and underappreciated risk factor for future CV disease. There is a pressing need to better understand predictors of excessive postpartum weight retention in order to deliver effective and scalable weight loss interventions during a period when women at highest risk may be particularly receptive to lifestyle change.  Social incentives, or the influences that impact behavior change based on relationships, are strong motivators of healthy behavior. The use of game design elements, such as goal-setting, has been successfully combined with social incentives to enhance healthy behavior in other disease settings. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a behavioral intervention using these novel approaches, combined with an established behavioral weight loss program, will provide an effective, and scalable solution to reduce the incidence of postpartum obesity. This proposal will leverage mentorship of senior investigators (Drs. Michal Elovitz and Peter Groeneveld) and Penn’s mature research programs in cardiovascular medicine, maternal fetal medicine, and behavioral economics. Research will be conducted in an urban and racially diverse population since these women are most likely to benefit from interventions to reduce CV risk. Aim 1 will use robust statistical methods and machine learning to create a clinical prediction tool for postpartum weight retention in an existing electronic health record database enriched with neighborhood-level data. Aim 2 will use qualitative and mixed methods to identify strategies to enhance the design of a pilot intervention using patient feedback. Aim 3 will implement a 2-arm single site randomized clinical trial to achieve weight loss in women with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension participating in an online behavioral weight loss program using remote technology and social feedback from other postpartum women.  This proposal will identify women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and will test and refine interventions that are able to be disseminated to postpartum women remotely. Dr. Lewey is a general cardiologist trained in women’s health and population science with established expertise in pregnancy associated cardiovascular disorders. The training she proposes in advanced statistical methods, qualitative analysis, and behavioral clinical trial design will position her to become a leader in women’s cardiovascular health. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions to prevent heart disease in women. The results of the proposed K23 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. PROJECT NARRATIVE The postpartum period represents a unique time in a women’s life when many women gain excess weight and make the transition to becoming overweight or obese. We propose to rigorously study predictors of postpartum obesity and evaluate an innovative approach to improve weight loss in the postpartum period using an online behavioral weight loss program and social feedback from a team of other postpartum women. By identifying women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and testing interventions that are low cost, sustainable, and remotely delivered, we hope to significantly improve cardiovascular health and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in women, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,10040416,K23HL153667,"['Accountability', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Censuses', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perinatal', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical environment', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'gestational weight gain', 'health care service utilization', 'healthy lifestyle', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'novel strategies', 'obesity prevention', 'patient oriented', 'peer support', 'postpartum weight', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'weight loss intervention', 'weight loss program']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2020,175248,-0.006290528239090617
"From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models PROJECT SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating neuropsychiatric illness that affects 2-5% of youth and causes morbidity, functional impairment, and suicide. Prodromal manic symptoms without manic episodes usually emerge before BD types I and II (BD-I/II) develop, but less than 60% of youth with manic symptoms will develop BD-I/II. The uncertainty of diagnosis and illness progression results in potentially detrimental interventions and 7-10 years delay appropriate treatments. It is thus imperative that objective biomarkers of risk for conversion to BD-I/II are identified and tested in youth before the peak onset of illness. Given that neural measures of structure and function associated with emotion and reward processing, in combination with clinical and behavior measures, can improve prediction of psychiatric outcomes in youth, this project will investigate brain-behavior relations in the most severely ill youth during inpatient stays and aims to build a predictive model of BD. We aim to use two distinct analytic models to test our hypotheses. First a general linear model (GLM) with a machine learning (ML) model of regularized regression with cross validation and second a whole brain ML pattern recognition model. We will first identify neural and behavioral markers of BD-I/II in circuitry associated with emotion and reward processing. We hypothesize that decreased activity and connectivity in prefrontal, amygdala, and striatal regions and behavioral measures showing less sleep, lower activity, and poorer mood and cognition will distinguish BD- I/II from clinically matched youth without mania and healthy. Next, we will identify using ML a whole brain neural classifier of BD-I/II relative to clinically matched inpatients without mania. Aim 2 is to, after two years, identify and quantify the neural and behavioral measures that predict conversion to BD-I/II, and to test individual conversion in an independent group of high symptomatic risk adolescents. Aim 3 is to identify brain-behavior associations for app development. Training samples include mid-/post- pubertal adolescents aged 13-17 years recruited from the nation’s only specialized inpatient unit for adolescents with BD and the general adolescent unit at our hospital; 70 well-characterized adolescents with BD-I/II, a clinically matched group of 70 inpatient youth without mania. Testing sample is an independent group of 180 adolescents with manic symptoms without BD-I/II. 60 healthy controls will be recruited. The project includes emotion and reward processing neural function and structure, clinical and behavioral measures including sleep and activity with actigraphy, computerized cognitive measures, and self-reports during inpatient evaluation and for two weeks post discharge. At two-year follow up, clinical assessments will confirm diagnoses. This is the first study to employ a multimodal assessment of behavior and mood symptoms combined with multimodal imaging methods to comprehensively assess disease-specific abnormalities and prediction of BD-I/II. Findings from this study may identify biological and behavioral markers of conversion to BD-I/II in adolescents and may contribute developing disease-specific risk calculators, low-cost biosensors for mobile applications, and novel targets of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescents may experience manic symptoms that may or may not progress into bipolar disorder. This proposed longitudinal study would be the first of its kind and could shed light on the neural and behavioral markers of disease progression in high-risk adolescents with manic symptoms.

"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9938687,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'social factors', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2020,710639,-0.010557571419380575
"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response. These are critical steps toward improving infant health outcomes through both targeted treatment of infection and reduced unnecessary early-life antibiotic exposures.",Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood,9861218,K23AI139337,"['Acute-Phase Proteins', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood Proteins', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fetal Development', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Haptoglobins', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Mycoses', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Infection', 'Placenta', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Sepsis', 'Serum Proteins', 'Serum amyloid A protein', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adverse outcome', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'early onset', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fetal', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant morbidity', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbiome alteration', 'neonatal infection', 'neonatal outcome', 'neonatal sepsis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'research and development', 'research study', 'sex', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational research program']",NIAID,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,K23,2020,189950,-0.031286942936010115
"Metal-nutrient mixtures in epidemiologic and toxicologic studies of cardiovascular disease Abstract This proposal is designed to extend and complement our R01-funded case-cohort study of cadmium (Cd) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Herein we will add arsenic (As), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) to our case-cohort study and include epidemiologic and toxicologic mixtures analyses. The four elements we have selected are compelling for their independent role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and as a mixture. As increases plaque formation and adhesion to endothelium and Cd also induces endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis; yet it is not clear if the effects of As and Cd are synergistic or competing. To potentially counteract these processes, Mg is important for modulating endothelial function. While Ca’s role is equivocal, its role in calcification of the arteries is undeniable, making it important to consider as well. Our efficient case-cohort study design includes 810 cases of AMI and a comparison subcohort of 600 men and 600 women selected randomly from never smokers at risk of AMI at the start of follow-up, leveraging the prospective population-based Danish Diet Cancer and Health Cohort. We are already funded to measure Cd, creatinine, osmolality, and cotinine in baseline urine samples. We now propose to additionally analyze As species, Mg, and Ca in urine among ~2000 participants selected into this case-cohort study, along with pre-existing food frequency questionnaire data on Mg and Ca. In Aim 1 we will evaluate the association between each of As, Ca, and Mg, and incidence of AMI. This will be one of the largest prospective studies of these elements in relation to AMI. In Aim 2 we will apply mixtures methods (Bayesian kernel machine regression, weighted quantile sum regression, random forests) to evaluate the interactive and joint effects of Cd, As, Ca, and Mg in relation to AMI risk. In Aim 3 we will apply in vitro and in vivo approaches to study combined effects of exposure to these elements to investigate the toxicologic mechanisms and pathways of activity. Each Aim is independently compelling and will provide important scientific contributions but together the complementary approaches have the potential to provide evidence of consistency in findings across the distinct approaches. Triangulating data across in vitro, in vivo and epidemiologic analyses represents a translational bridge as depicted in the NIEHS translational research framework. The scope of this virtual consortium will enrich our understanding of the relationships between Cd, As, Mg, Ca, and CVD. Other innovative features of our study include leveraging an existing efficient case-cohort design, large sample size, a large number of incident AMI events, controlling for tobacco smoking, in vitro assays of pro-atherogenic mechanisms, and in vivo studies of atherosclerosis. Sources of exposure to these elements are well known, therefore the identification of mixtures of these elements as cardiovascular risk/protective factors can have major implications for the prevention and control of CVD. Public Health Relevance Mechanistic and epidemiologic studies suggest a mixture of elements including cadmium, arsenic, magnesium, and calcium may play an important role in cardiovascular disease as risk and protective factors. We propose to create a virtual consortium to study chemical mixtures of these elements in relation to risk of cardiovascular disease using state-of-the-art techniques in exposure science, epidemiology, biostatistics, and cardio-toxicology.

"Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood traumatic stress (CTS), resulting from experiences such as abuse and neglect, is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences effecting overall health across the lifespan. Growing evidence shows that the negative effects of CTS are not limited to a single individual and may be transmitted across generations, increasing the risk for behavioral and psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Psychological stress during pregnancy is associated with heightened stress responses, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral problems in infancy and early childhood potentially making it a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The majority of studies examining maternal psychological stress (MPS) during pregnancy consider the magnitude of stress as the `risk factor' for alterations in offspring development; however, psychological stress, particularly during the prenatal period, is dynamic and variable. Infant neurodevelopment occurs sequentially and is sensitive to environmental influences, meaning that the effect of any insult is likely as much about the timing, as it is the magnitude. As a result, it remains unclear which aspects of stress most strongly impact offspring development – is it simply the magnitude as previously suggested, or does the trajectory matter as well? Understanding the variability of prenatal factors and their influence on infant neurobiological and psychosocial development is critical to targeting preventive interventions. The goal of this proposal is to explore maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress. The overall hypothesis is that a history of maternal CTS will increase the amplitude and velocity of MPS trajectories compared to a low-risk group, will predict increased offspring limbic system connectivity and negative affect expression, and that an intervention to reduce MPS in a high-risk sample will alter the observed trajectories. These hypotheses will be tested using a novel methodology that characterizes the longitudinal heterogeneity of psychological symptom data to create MPS trajectories. These trajectories will be used to explore the role of timing and rate of change of MPS on offspring neurobiological and affective development and, further, to test whether these trajectories mediate the effects of CTS on infant development. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To characterize the longitudinal heterogeneity of MPS in a sample of women with and without a history of CTS; (2) To examine the effects of heterogeneous longitudinal trajectories in MPS on offspring limbic system and negative affect development in mothers with and without childhood trauma; and (3) (Exploratory) To determine whether an intervention designed to reduce MPS will alter MPS trajectories in a high-risk sample. This study aims to elucidate the importance of trajectories of MPS for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS. Achieving these goals will provide insight into the best timing for targeted screening and interventions to alter MPS during pregnancy for women with a history of CTS and, thereby, reduce the risk of offspring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood traumatic stress is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences for psychological well-being, such as increased stress reactivity and increased risk for perinatal psychopathology. The proposed research will integrate tools from developmental neuroscience, clinical science, and computer science to: (1) examine the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a potential mediator of childhood traumatic stress on infant brain and negative affect development; and (2) evaluate whether an intervention designed to reduce maternal psychological stress will alter the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal prenatal stress. By identifying the importance of trajectories of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS, this work stands to improve the targeting and timing of prenatal interventions for women with a history of childhood traumatic stress.",Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress,9999677,F30MH118762,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Limbic System', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'maternal risk', 'maternal stress', 'mindfulness based cognitive therapy', 'negative affect', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatric trauma', 'prenatal', 'prenatal intervention', 'prenatal stress', 'psychological symptom', 'psychosocial development', 'random forest', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'stress reactivity', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,3.126990955394809e-05
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,9899101,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2020,572773,0.0021632436928388675
"A preconception cohort study of environmental chemicals, fertility, and miscarriage ABSTRACT Infertility and spontaneous abortion (SAB) are significant public health problems, affecting up to 25% of reproductive age couples in the United States. Health care costs attributable to infertility and SAB exceed $5 billion per year, and several studies have shown an association between infertility treatments and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors for subfertility and SAB is an important public health goal. The potential effects of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on risk of subfertility and SAB are understudied. The few existing human studies have limitations including small sample size, enrollment after conception, retrospective study design, suboptimal assessment of exposure and outcome, inadequate control for potential confounding variables, and limited generalizability. The proposed study will prospectively assess the relation of exposure to selected EDCs, including phenols, phthalates, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), to risk of subfertility and SAB in a preconception subcohort of 950 pregnancy planners. We will use data from two NICHD-supported prospective cohorts of pregnancy planners in North America and Denmark. With web-based recruitment and data collection, we have enrolled over 17,000 women attempting pregnancy into these cohorts. In a subset of 200 participants, we have successfully pilot tested in-person collection of urine and blood specimens during the preconception and early pregnancy periods. In this application, we propose to expand in-person biospecimen collection, increasing the number of women with preconception and early pregnancy urine and blood samples from 200 to 950. At each of our three biospecimen collection sites (Boston, Detroit, and Aarhus), we will enroll 250 women and collect three urine samples and one blood sample (in preconception) and three urine samples and one blood sample (in early pregnancy). We will ship the samples to the CDC for the analysis of urinary phthalates, urinary phenols, and serum PFAS. To increase cost efficiency, we will pool three urine samples in each exposure window before assaying for phthalates and phenols; and we will assay one preconception blood specimen for PFAS, a persistent chemical, in analyses of subfertility and SAB. Finally, we will conduct a pilot study among 100 U.S. participants to assess the feasibility of collecting urine by mail, which would allow us to take advantage of our full geographically-diverse cohort in the future. Strengths of this application include the prospective design, preconception enrollment of pregnancy planners, repeated measurement of exposure during preconception and early pregnancy, excellent control for confounding via bimonthly prospective data collection on a wide range of covariates, and use of the latest analytic methods for mixtures modeling. We have generated compelling preliminary data to support our aims. The present grant is cost-effective in leveraging already-established cohort studies with data collection and follow-up supported by other grants. The results generated will be translatable by directly informing future regulatory decisions about EDC standards in a manner that could reduce rates of infertility and SAB.

"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview- based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,9984613,R01MH120089,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'metropolitan', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,572946,-0.012811863223423684

"Place-level discrimination and birth outcomes Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability.  In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination  partially contributes to this disparity. Most of research on discrimination and birth outcomes  relies on self-reported experiences of discrimination, and there have been few studies examining  discrimination at the U.S. national level. Social contexts in which greater hostility towards  minorities is manifested may cause psychological stress and increase risk of adverse birth  outcomes. The scientific objective of this research plan is to develop a new county-level indicator  of discriminatory attitudes from social media data as well as make use hate crimes data and  measures of explicit and implicit racial bias to provide a detailed and nuanced investigation of  the impact of discrimination on birth outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities in birth outcomes.  Another strength of this research plan is the longitudinal study design with multiple years of data  for both measures of discrimination and birth outcomes, which allows us to control for temporal  trends and stable characteristics of the counties. Furthermore, the influence of discrimination on  birth outcomes may begin prior to pregnancy. There is increasing recognition of maternal health  prior to conception influencing fetal development and birth outcomes. The project will empirically  evaluate whether place-level discrimination is associated with biomarkers of chronic stress among  young women of child-bearing age. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds  on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in: 1)  developing expertise in Big Data, 2) measurement of discrimination, and 3) stress physiology and  birth outcomes. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful  independent research career evaluating how discrimination impact minority health and health  disparities. Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability.  In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination  partially contributes to this disparity.

"Virtual Reality Tools to Enhance Evidence Based Treatment of Substance Use Disorders (R41/R42 - Clinical Trial Optional) R&R Other Project Information 7. Project Summary/Abstract Neurobiological changes caused by addiction impair behavioral control and increase relapse risk (Volkow, Koob, & McLellan, 2016), substantiating the need for long-term care coordination and recovery engagement for individuals with Substance Use Disorders (SUD) (Humphreys, Malenka, Knutson, & MacCoun, 2017). Because addiction creates stress and reward system dysregulation impairing emotional regulation and executive functioning capacities when experiencing intense craving (Volkow, Koob & McLellan, 2016), traditional didactic relapse prevention strategies may have limited efficacy for those in early recovery when they transition back to their natural communities’ post-discharge from treatment, where they will be exposed to SUD-related stimuli. New recovery support models that detect implicit cue-induced neurophysiological dysregulation and restore real-time regulatory capacity to decrease relapse risk are of clinical significance. ​This feasibility Phase I study will use Virtual Reality (VR) technology to 1) simulate a patient-specific drug cue-triggering experience (VR_drug) to calibrate a personalized neurophysiological relapse risk set-point, captured in-session using fNIRS (​Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy​) sensors, a portable alternative to fMRI which will be integrated into the VR HMD (Head Mounted Display),​ and physiological sensors (smartwatch Empatica E4) worn during the VR_drug scenario ​(Aim 1); ​and 2) simulate a recovery-regulation experience (VR_recovery) using patient-specific virtually-generated sober-supportive relationships, recovery-enhanced environmental conditions, and recovery-associated sensory cues, to calibrate a recovery-regulated neurophysiological set-point, captured by the same in-session neurophysiological sensors systems ​(Aim 2)​. If successful, in Phase II, a mobile recovery support system product will be developed to help individuals in SUD recovery modulate real-time craving by monitoring their personalized neurophysiological relapse risk and activating their recovery-regulation intervention (VR_recovery) to alter urge reactivity in real-time. This type of mobile intervention that is immediately available to individuals in recovery as they leave treatment institutions and transition back into their natural communities may help manage in-the-moment drug urges in ways that allow engagement in other recovery-related activities (e.g., calling a sponsor, getting to a meeting), decreasing real-time relapse risk (Matto,& Seshaiyer, 2018; Matto, 2015; Matto, et al, 2014). R&R Other Project Information 8. Project Narrative Addiction is a self-regulation disorder where chronic exposure to and compulsive consumption of the drug creates dysregulation in the reward, stress and executive functioning regions of the brain, intensifying emotional reactivity and impairing cognitive and behavioral control (Volkow, Koob, & McLellan, 2016). This study seeks to examine the utility of using Virtual Reality (VR) simulations to calibrate person-specific neurophysiological relapse-risk and recovery regulation set-points. Results may lead to the development of a non-pharmacological mobile recovery support system to help individuals in SUD recovery manage implicit craving reactivity in ways that reduce relapse risk.",Virtual Reality Tools to Enhance Evidence Based Treatment of Substance Use Disorders (R41/R42 - Clinical Trial Optional),9898050,R41DA050225,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cocaine', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Conscious', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotional', 'Euphoria', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Feeds', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Care', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'care coordination', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'conditioning', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'head mounted display', 'implicit memory', 'meetings', 'neurophysiology', 'phase 1 study', 'portability', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'smart watch', 'sobriety', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality simulation']",NIDA,"BRIGHTLINE INTERACTIVE, LLC",R41,2020,218097,-0.04690161434844791
"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions.

"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations. With this study we propose to adapt a wildly popular method used in computer vision applications, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and develop flexible extensions for many epidemiologic settings. We propose to assess the performance of this method, compare with existing methods and employ in real-life applications, as well as develop and share software so other research can also use this novel, robust and flexible tool.",Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies,9843133,R01ES028805,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational workshop', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Poison', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Work', 'cardiovascular emergency', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'pollutant', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,569866,0.004967781734068891
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Physical, Social, and Economic Environments and Firearm Fatalities among Youth Project Summary / Abstract (30 lines) As a social epidemiologist and junior faculty member at UC Davis, my career goal is to build a program of research that identifies fundamental causes of violence and its determinants, and to use this understanding to test effective approaches to reduce violence-related harm. The relationship between neighborhood-level characteristics and firearm violence is well recognized. However, these multiple exposures likely operate in complex and reciprocal ways with each other and with crime and violence that are not yet well understood. Therefore, I propose to take advantage of an existing dataset built for an ongoing study of demolition and rehabilitation of decaying properties in Cleveland, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan, for which I am the principal investigator, to describe the range of neighborhood-level exposures in each of these cities and to identify how these exposures work together to impact firearm violence. These objectives will be accomplished through three specific aims: Aim 1: To describe variation in classes of neighborhood interventions across neighborhoods and neighborhood characteristics in Cleveland, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan from 2010 through 2019; Aim 2: to identify the neighborhood-level exposures that are most predictive of high levels of neighborhood youth firearm violence; and Aim 3: to estimate effects of individual neighborhood interventions and classes of neighborhood interventions on rates of neighborhood violent crime, firearm-related crime, firearm homicides, and firearm suicides among youth and young adults age 10 to 29. I will use detailed datasets primarily built from parcel- level administrative data in each city in order to accomplish the aims of the proposed study. These datasets use micro-data to describe neighborhood characteristics such as home quality, foreclosure rates, land use type, and vacancies. These micro-data are coupled with census variables on demographics, education levels, and other socioeconomic indicators and are aggregated to census tracts. We also undertook a thorough and systematic review of programs and policies hypothesized to influence violence prevention, either directly (e.g. changes in policing strategies) or indirectly (e.g. incentives to encourage buying homes in specific neighborhoods) and critical events, defined as expected and unexpected shocks to the cities, over the study period (2010-2019). These interventions and events are mapped to specific locations and dates. I will use a range of rigorous statistical methods, including latent class analysis, ensemble machine learning and causal inference methods, and spatial analysis methods to accomplish the study aims. I have identified three critical areas where continued training will prepare me to pursue my career goals and make important contributions to the field of violence prevention. These include training in 1) spatial analysis, 2) criminology and criminal justice theory, and 3) the analysis of multiple, correlated exposures. The experience gained through the proposed program of study will help me develop the skills, understanding, and experience I need to succeed in my career goals and allow me to answer critical questions on neighborhood exposures and youth firearm violence. Project Narrative (3 sentences) While the relationship between neighborhood-level characteristics and firearm violence is well recognized, very little is known about the relative importance and joint effects of the multiple and dynamic exposures that make up the neighborhood environment. Describing the range of exposures and their relative importance in predicting youth firearm violence, as well as the independent and joint effects of these exposures on firearm violence is critical for developing a deeper understanding of how “place” affects violence. Investigation of the environmental causes of firearm violence may illuminate broad-based interventions with a greater ability to achieve widespread and lasting impacts.","Physical, Social, and Economic Environments and Firearm Fatalities among Youth",10136967,K01CE003224,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,K01,2020,124066,-0.014956470180934824
"Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the “Alcoa Study” remains the development of increasingly rich models to explain the disparate health and work-capacity trajectories demonstrated in this universally insured, geographically, socially and economically diverse cohort of 200,000+ men and women as they progress from work-life into retirement. Outcomes of focus remain incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to 1) early life social context via Census data; 2) personal and family work experience and income across the life span via IRS and SSA; 3) post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI) and 4) contextual social environment from lifetime residential geocoding. Consequently, we propose in the next cycle to embrace a life course approach to study the social, environmental and behavioral determinants of the outcomes listed above The specific aims of this grant are: Aim 1: Link Alcoa workers to individual census records to examine how early life environment influences later life health outcomes; Aim 2: Assess the impact on health and function of adverse working environment as it accrues during work-life, with an emphasis on ubiquitous physical hazards; Aim 3: Identify antecedents of short-term and long-term disability across working life as candidates for subsequent hypothesis testing; Aim 4: Assess the impact disability benefits have on employee work function and health; Aim 5: Examine how injuries and health shocks affect retirement savings and subsequent health trajectories; Aim 6: To address generalizability across studies and populations, compare the Alcoa population to relevant complementary datasets, administrative and survey. Viewed altogether, continuation of the Alcoa study with the assembled team of investigators provides an unparalleled opportunity to address a host of critical empiric and methodologic issues previously unapproachable. In addition to understanding better which occupational exposures contribute to chronic disease and disability, these data will allow us to control for economic and other contextual factors to an extraordinary degree. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Alcoa research infrastructure—linking quantitative exposure measures to myriad hazards of active workers whose behavior, social environment and health status from pre-employment through retirement to death are fully observed—provides a unique opportunity to extend our work on the outcomes of focus including incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. During the current grant cycle we have augmented the infrastructure and data linkages to our already unique data set, such that we now have access to early life social context, personal and family work experience and income and post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI).","Disease, Disability and Death in an Aging Workforce",9965695,R01AG026291,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Disability Insurance', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Occupational Health', 'Outcome', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Price', 'Privatization', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Shock', 'Social Environment', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'disability', 'disability impact', 'experience', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'mortality', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'uptake']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,691831,-0.0355640497419798
"Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of both existing physical mannequin-based training and virtual media to support clinical learning using Augmented Reality (AR). Significance: Education in clinical settings is often challenging, infeasible, risky, difficult to organize, time-consuming, and expensive. Due to these barriers, the value of mannequin-based simulation is well recognized and is incorporated extensively into medical education. In general, the purpose of mannequin use in education is to simulate a physical ""patient"" on which to learn, demonstrate, and test skill without fear of harming patients prior to entering clinical environments. Despite their substantial benefits, physical mannequins have several fundamental limitations that do not allow them to demonstrate the many unique phases and expressions of a disease or person-to-person differences in anatomy and physiology. This limits the ability for a learner to view dynamic changes over time and to explore disease progression and consequences of interventions. Hypothesis: This research hypothesizes that existing, current mannequins can be enhanced through an innovative and practical Augmented Reality solution. In the Phase I effort a prototype system and sample educational material covering Pressure Ulcer care was developed and analyzed through pilot studies with Nursing educators, Doctoral Degree in Nursing (DNP) students, and pre-licensure students. The pilot results of the technology demonstrated a high degree of positivity and exceptional enthusiasm and all Phase I metrics of success were met or exceeded. Specific Aims: In Phase II the following aims are proposed: 1) Design a comprehensive suite of course content and design the technology's integration into a College of Nursing course, 2) Develop a production-ready system, and 3) Validate the system utility through human subject testing and expert evaluation of the system. Project Narrative Over the past decade, medical simulation has been experiencing explosive growth and widespread adoption. There are now over 800 medical simulation centers in the US alone, located in medical schools, nursing schools, hospitals, military simulation centers, and schools of allied health professions. The global market for Mannequin-Based Simulation is projected to reach $1 Billion by 2020. It is hypothesized that the combination of existing physical mannequin-based training with virtual media will open new possibilities for exploration and enhanced learning interactions for medical education. 3T",Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults,9964623,R44AG057257,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Allied Health Profession', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Augmented Reality', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Course Content', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Materials', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Focus Groups', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Licensure', 'Location', 'Manikins', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Military Personnel', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Nursing Schools', 'Nursing Students', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Skin', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'animation', 'base', 'caregiver education', 'college', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'impression', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'miniaturize', 'person centered', 'professor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'teacher', 'virtual']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2020,688185,-0.044679014849754846
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis,9898476,K23MH116130,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Israel', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'computational basis', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'economic cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal course', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'responsible research conduct', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'smart watch', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2020,191000,0.00023161027222236714
"Novel Designs and Methods to Remove Hidden Confounding Bias in Health Sciences Abstract A major approach in causal inference literature aimed at mitigating bias due to unmeasured confounding is the so- called instrumental variable (IV) design which relies on identifying a variable which (i) influences the treatment process, (ii) has no direct effect on the outcome other than through the treatment, and (iii) is independent of any unmeasured confounder. IV methods are very well developed and widely used in social and health science, although validity of IV inferences may not be reliable if any of required assumptions (i)-(iii) is violated. This proposal aims to develop (a) new IV methods robust to violation of any of (i)-(iii); (b) New negative control methods that can be used to detect and sometimes to nonparametrically account for unmeasured confounding bias; (c) New bracketing methods for partial inference about causal effects in comparative interrupted time series studies. The proposed methods will be used to address current scientific queries in three major substantive public health areas:(1) to understand the health effects of air pollution; (2) to quantify the causal effects of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders; (3) To uncover the mechanism by which a randomized package of interventions produced a substantial reduction of HIV incidence in a recent major cluster randomized trial of treatment as prevention in Botswana, Africa. Our proposal will provide the best available analytical methods to date to resolve confounding concerns in these high impact public health applications and more broadly in observational studies in the health sciences. Summary This proposal aims to develop new causal inference methods to tame bias due to hidden confounding factors in obser- vational studies as well as in randomized experiments subject to non-adherence. The proposed methods are firmly grounded in modern semiparametric theory which will be used to obtain more robust and efficient inferences about causal effects in a broad range of public health applications including in Epidemiology of Aging, Environmental Health Epidemiology and HIV/AIDS Prevention.",Novel Designs and Methods to Remove Hidden Confounding Bias in Health Sciences,9859751,R01AG065276,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Africa', 'Aging', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Botswana', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Genetic', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Randomized', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Thromboplastin', 'Time', 'ambient air pollution', 'analytical method', 'c new', 'comparative', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'intervention effect', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'uptake', 'user friendly software']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,502013,-0.055109903584548064
"Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach Project Summary Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern, yet it is not clear why individuals and populations differ in their protection against influenza infection. The factors underlying protection can act at multiple scales, and thus building a more complete understanding of protection requires an approach that integrates data at the population, individual, and molecular levels. What factors influence population and individual risk of influenza infection? How different are the antibody responses of individuals against influenza and what factors drive those differences? Here, I propose to identify the relative influence of past infection, vaccination, and antigenic evolution on determining both individual and population susceptibility by quantitatively modeling high-resolution epidemiological and immunological data. In particular, I aim to determine the role of past influenza infection in shaping the susceptibility of different age groups, identify the specific targets of the human antibody response against influenza, and infer the relative importance of infection history, vaccination, and epitope immunogenicity on antibody specificity. This work will have a significant impact on our ability to predict future influenza infection and allow us to target interventions toward the most at-risk populations. Success of this project requires training in advanced computational and statistical methods and state-of-the-art immunological techniques by members of the Departments of Ecology & Evolution and Medicine at the University of Chicago. This interdisciplinary and collaborative training environment will provide a strong foundation for gaining more complete understanding of the interactions between influenza and the human immune system. Project Narrative Influenza infection is a significant public health concern resulting in thousands of deaths annually. Here, I propose to systematically identify how exposure history, vaccination, and other factors affect individual susceptibility to influenza infection. These insights will improve our ability to identify populations most at-risk for infection as well as allow us to tailor intervention and prevention efforts to more effectively combat seasonal influenza.",Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach,10008955,F32AI145177,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Avidity', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Binding', 'Birth', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glycoproteins', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neuraminidase', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive measure', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seasons', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface Antigens', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'age group', 'base', 'cohort', 'combat', 'design', 'immunogenicity', 'imprint', 'improved', 'individual response', 'infection risk', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'seasonal influenza', 'success', 'universal influenza vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F32,2020,65310,-0.027500297522619767
"Developing Computational Methods for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistant Agents PROJECT ABSTRACT  Antimicrobial resistance is a critical public health issue. Infections with drug resistant pathogens are estimated to cause an additional eight million hospitalization days annually over the hospitalizations that would be seen for infections with susceptible agents. The use of antibiotics (in both clinical and agricultural settings) is being viewed as precursor for these infections and thus, is a major public health concern—particularly as outbreaks become more frequent and severe. However, scientiﬁc evidence describing the hazards associated with antibiotic use is lacking due to inability to quantify the risk of these practices. One promising avenue to elucidate this risk is to use shotgun metagenomics to identify the AMR genes in samples taken through systematic spatiotemporal surveillance. The goal of this proposed work is to develop algorithms that will provide such a means for analysis. The algorithms need to be scalable to very large datasets and thus, will require the development and use succinct data structures.  In order to achieve this goal, the investigative team will develop the theoretical foundations and applied meth- ods needed to study AMR through the use of shotgun metagenomics. A major focus of the proposed work is developing algorithms that can handle very large datasets. To achieve this scalability, we will create novel means to create, compress, reconstruct and update very large de Bruijn graphs that metagenomics data in a manner needed to study AMR. In addition, we will pioneer the study of AMR through long read data by proposing new algorithmic problems and solutions that use data. For example, identifying the location of speciﬁc genes in a metagenomics sample using long read data has not been proposed or studied. Thus, the algorithmic ideas and techniques developed in this project will not only advance the study of AMR, but contribute to the growing domain of big data analysis and pan-genomics.  Lastly, we plan to apply our methods to samples collected from both agricultural and clinical settings in Florida. Analysis of preliminary and new data will allow us to conclude about (1) the public risk associated with antimicro- bial use in agriculture; (2) the effectiveness of interventions used to reduce resistant bacteria, and lastly, (3) the factors that allow resistant bacteria to grow, thrive and evolve. A–1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Antibiotic use in agriculture is a major public health concern that is receiving a lot of media attention, par- ticularly as antibiotic-resistant infections in become more frequent and severe.

"Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data PROJECT SUMMARY This study will leverage large-scale clinical data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify existing pharmaceutical agents commonly prescribed for a multitude of indications that are incidentally associated with improvements in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Through prior efforts, a data source containing almost 20 years of treatment data on all (over one million) VA users diagnosed with PTSD between October 1999 and February 2018 has been constructed, including a complete historical record of their evidence-based medication and psychotherapy receipt within the VA healthcare system. Importantly, the team has also amassed symptom-level patient-reported PTSD outcome data for hundreds of thousands of these patients. The existing data is a powerful resource with which the research team proposes to explore the following specific aims: (1) identify off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms over time; (2) further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of newly-identified off-label pharmaceutical agents for improvement in PTSD symptoms using rigorous causal methods; and (3) identify common adverse events related to off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms in this complex, psychiatrically and medically ill population The proposed project will identify agents that may merit further rigorous clinical evaluation for psychiatric benefit. New therapeutic targets may be identified that will lead to greater treatment options or specific treatments. Further, identification of off-label medications that improve or have contraindicated effects for psychiatric populations will provide critical guidance to practicing clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, there are few psychopharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and available medications do not work sufficiently. In a recent published statement, NIMH noted that “The National Institute of Mental Health would relish the chance to partner with our VA colleagues to exploit [VA data] with the aim of providing guidelines for evidence-based pharmacotherapy for those suffering from PTSD, Veterans and civilians alike.” The proposed study was specifically designed in response to that call; it will use exploratory methods to identify off-label medications that are effective for the treatment of PTSD using a large VA medical records-based dataset.",Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data,9858600,R01MH121397,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Paroxetine', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Scanning', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label drug', 'prospective', 'psychopharmacologic', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy development', 'treatment guidelines', 'venlafaxine', 'working group']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,648991,-0.02141089359024045
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity.

"Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage ABSTRACT Despite major eradication efforts over the past century, malaria remains a significant world-wide health burden. Plasmodium vivax poses the greatest obstacle to malaria eradication due to its ability to form dormant stages within the liver, called hypnozoites. Hypnozoites can reactivate weeks to years after the initial infection, leading to relapses, and can only be targeted by two licensed drugs with extensive side effects and toxicity that limits their use. Models of disease prevalence suggest that even a modest reduction of hypnozoite abundance in the liver could make a major impact on the spread of disease. All Plasmodium parasites that have been extensively studied have been shown to rely on specific host signaling events for invasion and development through liver stage infection. These host factors represent potential targets for host-based interventions. Unfortunately, there remains a dearth of knowledge regarding the host factors that permit Plasmodium vivax liver stages to persist and develop, in large part because of technical challenges associated with growing the parasite and then monitoring host signaling events in rare infected cells. Here, we propose to overcome these challenges by using two approaches, kinase regression and digital spatial profiling, to interrogate host-driven phosphosignaling in P. vivax-infected hepatocytes, including those that harbor hypnozoites. If successful, our approach will identify host kinases that are necessary for P. vivax developing and dormant liver stages, as well as phosphosignaling that is altered by infection. These data will dramatically enhance our understanding of host factors that regulate Plasmodium vivax liver infection, and in doing so provide insight into the cellular niche that promotes liver-stage parasite development and dormancy. In addition to enhancing the understanding of this largely mysterious process, this information could inform host-directed therapies, which represent a novel approach to targeting dormant malaria parasites. NARRATIVE Malaria kills approximately half of a million people annually. One of the major hurdles to malaria eradication is the ability of Plasmodium vivax to form hypnozoites, dormant liver stages that can remain within the host for years and lead to relapses. This proposal seeks to assess host factors that change upon, and are necessary for, P. vivax developing and dormant parasites, with the long-term goal of using this information to eliminate relapsing malaria.",Elucidating host phosphosignaling regulation of Plasmodium vivax liver stage,10056490,R21AI151344,"['Antibodies', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Onset of illness', 'Parasites', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Plasmodium yoelii', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sporozoites', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vivax Malaria', 'base', 'differential expression', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'infection rate', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'liver infection', 'malaria infection', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'side effect', 'small hairpin RNA', 'small molecule']",NIAID,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,281780,-0.046373325247849775
"A comparison of firearm-related intimate partner homicide in Texas and Maryland: Prevalence, identification of those at risk, and the effect of firearm regulations Intimate partner homicide (IPH) accounts for one-fifth of U.S. homicides, with the majority of IPH and nearly all (91.6%) of intimate-partner related homicide-suicides (IPH-S) committed by firearms. While much is known about the frequency by which IPH is committed by firearms, research is far more limited regarding how victim/perpetrator firearm access, ownership, and behaviors affect IPH and IPH-S risk. We propose a case-control study in two states (Maryland and Texas) chosen to provide robust interstate firearm comparisons, as well as demographic, geographic and relevant law diversity. We will collect case file (medical examiner, police, prosecutor) and interview data to compare the histories of IPH victims (cases) to those of a random sample of individuals who experienced non-fatal physical IPV in the past two years (controls). The study will accomplish the following: (1) Obtain a count of firearm-related IPH and IPH-S across multiple subgroups through triangulation of data from multiple sources; (2) Describe the context of IPH and IPH-S, including precipitating events, relationship history, and perpetrator characteristics such as prior suicidality and prior substance abuse; (3) Assess the strength of firearm access, ownership, and/or use as risk factors for IPH and IPH-S, attending to intersections with risk factors at the family (e.g., abuse history), community (e.g., community violence), social and environmental levels (e.g., state firearm policies, accessibility of social services); (4) Identify differential patterns of risk between firearm-related and non-firearm related IPH, and between firearm-related IPH and IPH-S; (5) Examine patterns of gun ownership behaviors and attitudes in relation to IPH and IPH-S. We will create a database that will combine data across current data collection endeavors, creating a foundation for future funding. Findings will inform future evidence-based, multiple-level prevention interventions and allow policy makers and practitioners to develop and refine risk-informed approaches to reduce and prevent lethal IPV outcomes.

"Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence Project Summary Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by inhalation of spores from the soil-dwelling fungi Coccidioides immitis or C. posadasii, and can lead to chronic lung infection, meningitis, or death. Southwestern states are currently experiencing among the highest incidence rates of coccidioidomycosis ever recorded. The disease has levied a substantial human and economic burden throughout the southwest, totaling an estimated $2.2 billion in charges in California alone for coccidioidomycosis-associated hospitalizations from 2000-2011. Critical gaps in understanding have hindered the public health response, including how dust, pathogen, and individual risk factors interact to determine disease incidence, as well as how environmental factors influence the distribution of the pathogen and dust. To address these gaps, this project investigates the impacts of dust exposure, environmental variability, and sociodemographic change on Coccidioides spp. proliferation, dispersion, and coccidioidomycosis infection rates in California. The research focuses on three main aims: 1) investigate the influence of climate variation and dust exposure on the spatiotemporal distribution of cocci incidence using >65,000 geolocated surveillance records from 2000 to 2018 and a case-crossover design; 2) identify environmental sources of C. immitis at high spatial and temporal resolution in disturbed and undisturbed soil, and determine how wind, rainfall, soil disturbance and other factors influence spore dispersion through longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil; and 3) predict changes in pathogen density over space and time and estimate the exposure-response relationship between pathogen density and risk of infection using a case-crossover approach with prospective surveillance for incident cases. In pursuit of these aims, the research will combine georeferenced coccidioidomycosis case data across California since 2000 at an unprecedented spatial resolution with fine-scale dust concentration estimates and environmental data from a combination of remote sensing, modeling and ground monitors. We will use novel field and laboratory methods to conduct longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil, determining how microenvironmental conditions and cyclical patterns of rainfall and drought determine pathogen source dynamics, and identifying conditions that support pathogen dispersion through the air. Through these activities, we will identify the specific dust conditions that pose the greatest risk for infection, estimate pathogen exposure and the dose- response relationship, and evaluate heterogeneity in this relationship across risk groups and regions. The results will elucidate drivers of the current epidemic, enhance understanding of the distribution and dispersion of Coccidioides spp. in the environment, and identify high risk regions and subpopulations. The knowledge gained will support decision-makers in targeting, designing and implementing protective measures for vulnerable populations. Project Narrative This project addresses gaps in our understanding of the kinds of dust exposures, and the environmental and social conditions, that increase the incidence of coccidioidomycosis in the southwest. The findings will have wide-ranging benefits for public health, including a better understanding of how people are exposed to the pathogen, the identification of areas and people that are at the highest risk, and predictions of future coccidioidomycosis that can be used to prevent infection in vulnerable groups.",Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence,9865174,R01AI148336,"['Address', 'Air', 'Area', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Climatology', 'Coccidioides', 'Coccidioides immitis', 'Coccidioides posadasii', 'Coccidioidomycosis', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Droughts', 'Dust', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Environmental Wind', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'High temperature of physical object', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Influenza', 'Inhalation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung infections', 'Measures', 'Meningitis', 'Meteorology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reproduction spores', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Social Conditions', 'Soil', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'burden of illness', 'density', 'design', 'environmental intervention', 'experience', 'fungus', 'high risk', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'remote sensing', 'response', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'temporal measurement', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,774446,-0.0038667397924983323
"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of what children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well.

"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis.

This allows a prospective view of the impact of early-life environments and socioeconomic status on health and well-being in later life. The massive database describes the characteristics of all 133 million persons who resided in the United States in 1940. The data have been available for only a brief period, but are already having a profound impact on scientific research. They are the primary data source for at least 19 sponsored projects, including nine funded by NIH and seven funded by NSF. Through May 2017, 104 investigators had produced 95 papers based on the data, including 22 articles, four books, three PhD dissertations, and 66 working papers. This project will improve the quality and usability of the database by correcting transcription errors; improving the coding, editing, and allocation of key variables; and introducing new data dissemination tools designed to simplify access to the data. The project will undertake three major activities to meet these objectives. 1. Incorporate new verified census information on name, age, sex, family relationship, race, marital status,  birthplace, and residence five years ago. 2. Improve coding, editing, and allocation for geographic variables, migration, occupation, and numerically-  coded variables such as income. 3. Apply new technologies to democratize access to the data through new data access tools and a virtual data  enclave for a restricted version of the data that contains names. This project is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education, and policy-making on health and aging. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. Narrative This project will develop data for prospective analysis of the impact of early-life circumstances and environment on health outcomes in late life, including Alzheimer's disease. The proposed improvement of data quality is urgent, and will provide a resource of unprecedented power for understanding the effects of public policies, social institutions, and environmental conditions on the health, well-being, and functioning of people, both over the life course and in their later years. The proposed work is directly relevant to the core mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA, since the data will allow us to observe today's late-life population when they were young.","Microdata for Analysis of Early Life Conditions, Health, and Population",9903193,R01AG041831,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Arbitration', 'Books', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints', 'Code', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Demography', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family Relationship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genealogy', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geography', 'Handwriting', 'Health', 'Income', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Names', 'Occupational', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Policy', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Social Processes', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Sociology', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'blind', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data dissemination', 'data enclave', 'data quality', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'migration', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'residence', 'sex', 'social', 'tool', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,662054,-0.03097918989633153
"Estimating Mediation Effects in Prevention Studies The purpose of this competing continuation grant proposal is to develop, evaluate and apply  methodological and statistical procedures to investigate how prevention programs change outcome  variables. These mediation analyses assess the link between program effects on the constructs targeted  by a prevention program and effects on the outcome. As noted by many researchers and federal  agencies, mediation analyses identify the most effective program components and increase  understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to changing outcome variables. Information from  mediation analysis can make interventions more powerful, more efficient, and shorter. The P. I. of this grant received a one-year NIDA small grant and four multi-year grants to develop and evaluate mediation  analysis in prevention research. This work led to many publications and innovations. The proposed  five-year continuation focuses on the further development and refinement of exciting new mediation  analysis statistical developments. Four statistical topics represent next steps in this research and include  analytical and simulation research as well as applications to etiological and prevention data. The work expands on our development of causal mediation and Bayesian mediation methods that hold great promise for mediation analysis. In Study 1, practical causal mediation and Bayesian mediation analyses  for research designs are developed and evaluated. This approach will clarify methods and develop  approaches for dealing with violation of testable and untestable assumptions. Study 2 investigates  important measurement issues for the investigation of mediation. This work will focus on methods to identify critical facets of mediating variables, approaches to understanding whether mediators and  outcomes are redundant, and develop methods for studies with big data. Study 3 continues the development and evaluation of new longitudinal mediation methods for ecological momentary assessment data and other studies with massive data collection. These new methods promise to more accurately model change over time for both individuals and groups of individuals. Study 4 develops methods to  uncover subgroups in mediation analysis including causal mediation methods, multilevel models, and new  approaches based on residuals for identifying individuals for whom mediating processes differ in  effectiveness from other individuals. For each study, we will investigate unique issues with mediation analysis of prevention data including methods for small N and also massive data collection (big data), the RcErLitEicVaANl rCoEle(Soeef imnsetruacstiounrse):ment for mediating mechanisms, and the application of the growing literature on  causal methods and Bayesian methods.

"Investigation of arterial changes in the Circle of Willis during intracranial aneurysm growth in humans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prevalence of saccular intracranial aneurysms (IA) in western populations is estimated at around ~3%. Clinically, IA present a dilemma, in that they are usually asymptomatic; however, IA are extremely dangerous if they rupture, causing subarachnoid hemorrhage (~50% mortality). There is convincing evidence that continued IA growth increases the risk of rupture (12-24 times). To better monitor and predict IA progression, there is a compelling need to better understand clinical IA growth (aneurysmal remodeling). 90% of IA occur within the arteries of the Circle of Willis (CoW). Despite there being overwhelming evidence connecting CoW vascular remodeling and IA disease, the majority of IA research focuses only on the IA site, and does not consider the contribution of connected arteries. Specific vascular remodeling in the CoW arteries may provide an additional indicator for monitoring IA progression. The biochemical processes that occur at the IA site include inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling leading to cell death and vessel wall degeneration. Analyses in animal models have strongly connected arterial wall shear stress (WSS) as a trigger of these processes, leading to IA initiation and remodeling. Patient-oriented research has further linked areas of low WSS with IA growth. Because CoW vasculature can change during IA growth, the blood flow entering IA changes and may create a new level of WSS to stabilize the remodeling process. Better understanding how human IA may naturally stabilize is highly relevant to predicting IA progression, and the role of changing WSS will be investigated in this grant. In our recent study of 520 clinically monitored IA, we found that while many IA grew consistently, following a projected growth path, others became stable. We also found that IA growth speed is significantly faster in women. Given the association of IA with sex, family history, and disease, different patterns of vascular remodeling may occur within groups with different genetics or medical history. We propose a clinical translational study to study IA growth in different genetic and medical history groups. We hypothesize IA growth may associate with patterns of vascular remodeling within the CoW. We will test our hypothesis with the following specific aims: (1) Is IA growth a local phenomenon or it associated with vascular remodeling within the CoW? (2) Do genetically similar individuals undergo similar patterns of vascular remodeling? (3) Does blood flow within the CoW associate with vascular remodeling? By identifying how IA disease progression may associate with other remodeling within the CoW, this study can identify new imaging biomarkers that enable improved IA treatment decisions. This proposal is significant because there is an unmet need to accurately assess IA disease progression and changes in risk. This proposal is innovative because it will extend existing IA studies to include more, relevant cerebrovascular arteries and longitudinal data, while implementing several technical innovations specific to this problem which can translate to clinical tracking of cerebrovascular changes PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracranial aneurysms are extremely dangerous when they rupture. When one is detected, it may be treated or monitored through imaging, with aneurysm growth a strong indication of increased risk of rupture. This project will study how remodeling in the arteries of the Circle of Willis associates with aneurysm growth, and how blood flow may determine locations of remodeling, in order to identify new biomarkers to improve tracking and assessment of aneurysm progression.",Investigation of arterial changes in the Circle of Willis during intracranial aneurysm growth in humans,9947821,R01HL152270,"['Affect', 'Aneurysm', 'Angiography', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Caliber', 'Cell Death', 'Characteristics', 'Circle of Willis', 'Clinical', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Woman', 'Work', 'arterial tortuosity', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical risk', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'sex', 'shape analysis', 'shear stress', 'side effect', 'tool', 'translational study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,693928,-0.00574419205999762
"Promoting Physical Activity in Latinas via lnteractive Web-based Technology Abstract  In the U.S., Latina women report higher rates of inactivity than their non-Hispanic White and male counterparts, and are disproportionately affected by related health conditions (e.g., cancer, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, diabetes). To address this public health crisis, evidence-based interventions that utilize state- of-the-art technology, theory and methods are needed to increase physical activity (PA) among this high-risk population. Recently, our team conducted a randomized controlled trial (N=205) to test the efficacy of a culturally adapted, individually tailored, Spanish-language Internet-based PA intervention among Latinas (Pasos Hacia La Salud, R01CA159954) vs. a Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. Although results were promising, the majority of participants still did not meet national guidelines for PA. In the ongoing renewal of R01CA159954, we will randomize 300 Latina women to either 1) the original Pasos Hacia La Salud tailored Internet-based PA intervention (Original Intervention) or 2) the data driven, enhanced version of the Pasos Hacia La Salud PA intervention (Enhanced Intervention).  The proposed supplement seeks to become the first trial to examine longitudinal patterns of PA adoption and maintenance across a series of longitudinal studies among Latinas. Traditional analytic methods would compare findings across studies and would estimate intervention effects at end of treatment controlling for baseline. We propose to use Integrative Data Analysis to combine data across studies and Latent Class Models to identifies patterns of PA adoption and maintenance. By using Latent Class Modeling (LCM), we will make full use of the longitudinal profile of PA data to identify patterns of change over time. LCMs use objective data (rather than a priori hypotheses) to subdivide the population into distinct groups of participants with similar profiles (of PA changes in this case). LCM can not only capture between- and within-subject heterogeneity, but can aid in the identification of meaningful subgroups within the population. By using this innovative method, we will not only reveal the inter-variability of PA over time but also elucidate the associations between such patterns and key psychosocial, behavioral and demographic predictors. Project Narrative Latinas exhibit high rates of inactivity and related chronic health conditions (including some cancers, diabetes, stroke, and hypertension), and are therefore in need of culturally and linguistically adapted physical activity interventions. The proposed supplement will build on the aims of the parent and renewal studies by using integrative data analysis to identify patterns of change in objectively measured physical activity over time, and test how these patterns relate to participant-level characteristics, including demographics, psychosocial and physiological predictors.",Promoting Physical Activity in Latinas via lnteractive Web-based Technology,9764734,R01CA159954,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Breast', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Endometrial', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Latina', 'Linguistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'analytical method', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'burden of illness', 'cancer risk', 'data reduction', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'exercise intervention', 'group intervention', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'longitudinal dataset', 'male', 'moderate-to-vigorous physical activity', 'post intervention', 'protective effect', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'social culture', 'success', 'theories', 'vector', 'vigorous intensity']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,216895,-0.01590202310264324
"Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic disabling psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction to the exposure to severe psychological stress, including trauma re-experiencing, hypervigilance, and hyperarousal. Our group has conducted seminal work to establish PTSD as a risk factor for coronary heart disease and autonomic dysfunction. A major concern, based on these findings, is that PTSD could increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) through autonomic dysregulation. This has important clinical implications on management of cardiovascular risk in PTSD. Two important metrics that are potentially useful for risk stratification are T-wave alternans (TWA) and Morphological Beat Variability (MVB). We have found in preliminary investigations that TWA may be linked to acute stress and PTSD, but additional study is needed. In this R03 application, we seek to collaborate with Dr. Gari Clifford in Biomedical Informatics to create a custom program that measures TWA and MVB with state-of- the-art signal processing in a recently recruited cohort of male veteran twins with high-resolution ECG data. We will also study for genetic influences with twin modeling and the effects of acute stress with laboratory- based trauma reminder challenges. Our aims are to 1) Examine the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA a) over 24 hours, and b) during trauma recall challenge; 2) Evaluate the potential role for familial and genetic factors by comparing the within-pair difference in MVB and TWA between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD. We hypothesize that MVB and TWA will be higher, on average, during a 24 hour period, and will increase during trauma recall challenge in PTSD subjects compared to those without PTSD. In addition, we hypothesize that the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA will be stronger within DZ pairs than MZ pairs, implying that there is a common genetic pathway linking PTSD and SCD risk. The development of methods to measure these factors, as well as the study of these important mechanisms, will accelerate Dr. Shah’s progress towards research independence, and help to establish him as an expert in the field of mental stress and SCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Posttraumatic stress disorder is a common and debilitating psychiatric condition that is associated with increased heart disease risk. Whether or not this means that it increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia is not known, but important for clinical management. To study this, we aim to examine the risk of PTSD and its symptoms on electrocardiographic markers of sudden cardiac death.",Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study,9915968,R03HL146879,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Arrhythmia', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional Stress', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Tachyarrhythmias', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Veterans', 'Viola', 'Visit', 'War', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'heart disease risk', 'heart rate variability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'male', 'method development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'programs', 'recruit', 'signal processing', 'sudden cardiac death', 'traumatic event', 'traumatic stress', 'vector']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,78000,-0.006600922829440282
"Infrared Eyes(iREyes) Infrared Eyes Abstract Eden Medical, Inc. is pleased to resubmit this Phase 2 SBIR proposal to develop the “Infrared Eyes” (iREyes) imager system, an affordable and powerful mobile health (mHealth) tool for healthcare. The hand-held iREyes system will acquire both thermal and visible spectrum imagery to quantify healing via thermal indexing methodology. The iREyes will offer a user-friendly product with automated categorization. Diabetic foot wounds are common, complex and costly. Foot areas that are likely to ulcerate are associated with increased local skin temperature due to inflammation and enzymatic autolysis of tissue. Inflammation is characterized by the cardinal signs including redness, swelling, and heat. In addition to identifying inflammation associated with healing, the iREyes will also identify hot spots associated with repetitive stress to reduce ulceration and re-ulceration risk for people in diabetic foot remission. The iREyes will directly quantify inflammation pathophysiology implementing a powerful revised two-part strategy: wound healing via regional foot index analysis and ulcer reoccurrence risk through temperature asymmetry threshold analysis. The combined thermal indexing for healing existing wounds and asymmetry predictive analysis represents a significant breakthrough over current practice.

"Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System Project Summary Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems offer substantial opportunities for helping people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to improve glucose control and lower HbA1c. However, the AID has only shown a benefit during the nighttime when meals, exercise, and stress do not significantly challenge the AID. Furthermore, hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) remains a common occurrence in people with type 1 diabetes and continues to occur even in the setting of AID, particularly with exercise. Integrating context awareness into an AID has the potential to improve glycemic time in range (70-180 mg/dL) during the daytime and reduce and possibly eliminate hypoglycemia. Contextual information can include inferred food intake, insulin dosing, inferred exercise type and duration, as well as movement patterns. An AID can be designed to recognize contextual patterns that relate to poor glycemic responses to meals and hypoglycemia and then adjust insulin dosing in response to these patterns in advance and help mitigate these problems. In this grant, we will explore how contextual information may be used within an AID to help (1) avoid hypoglycemia and (2) reduce postprandial dysglycemia. We will first conduct a data gathering study whereby we will collect a rich data set from people with T1D who will use sensor augmented pump therapy to manage their glucose. Data will be collected from these 30 patients over 28 days; data will include multivariable contextual information including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin data, food data, physical activity data (heart rate and accelerometry), as well as indoor/outdoor contextual movement patterns gathered using a novel beacon-based context-aware sensing system called MotioWear developed by our group in collaboration with our industry partner MotioSens. Next, we will utilize this contextual data set to construct a Bayesian glucose prediction algorithm. This will include a clustering algorithm that will group contextual sequences that are similar with each other and which lead to similar glycemic outcomes. This context-aware glucose prediction algorithm will be integrated into an adaptive, personalized, smartwatch-based context-aware AID (CA-AID) system. Contextual patterns that have a high likelihood of leading to hypoglycemia or postprandial dysglycemia will inform an insulin dosing aggressiveness factor to be adjusted for similar contextual sequences observed in the future (i.e. the CA-AID will reduce insulin for contextual sequences with high likelihood of hypoglycemia such as aerobic exercise). We expect that integrating context awareness into an AID will lead to significant improvements in time in target range during the day and will help reduce time in hypoglycemia. The CA-AID will be evaluated for safety in a small pilot study. We will then evaluate the CA-AID within a 6 week clinical study in 40 adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. Twenty will receive the CA-AID while the other 20 will receive a standard (non-context-aware) AID. The primary outcome measures of this study is the percent time in range. We hypothesize that the CA-AID will increase time in range by 10% as compared with a non-context aware AID. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. While automated insulin delivery systems can help people with type 1 diabetes better manage their glucose levels during the night, improved glycemic control during the day has not been demonstrated and hypoglycemia continues to be a problem, especially during exercise. We propose to develop and evaluate in a clinical study a context-aware automated insulin delivery system that learns patterns of daily living, meal patterns, glucose patterns, insulin dosing patterns, and physical activity patterns that relate to dysglycemia and adapts the gains within the AID to improve postprandial time in target range (70-180 mg/dL) and reduce hypoglycemia.",Improving Glycemic Management in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using a Context-aware Automated Insulin Delivery System,9977179,R01DK122583,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pump', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Restaurants', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Stress', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wrist', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'expectation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose sensor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'two-arm study', 'usability', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,653880,-0.006765175718634597
"A Multipronged Interrogation of Large-Scale Omics Data to Reveal COVID-19 Pathways The COVID-19 global pandemic has led to more than 470,000 deaths. This disease is especially perilous for the elderly - 80% of deaths in the US have been individuals over the age of 65, and the social isolation created by lockdowns have increased risks of serious physical and mental health issues.  COVID-19 is a heterogeneous disease exhibiting a broad spectrum of symptoms, ranging from mild (e.g. loss of smell, dry cough) to critical (e.g. cytokine storm, renal failure, cardiovascular damage, respiratory failure, lethal blood clotting, neurological disorders). This clinical heterogeneity demands a precision medicine approach that elucidates distinct pathways underlying the disease, develops treatments for each pathway, and defines biomarker patterns to diagnose patients for classification within the subsets. A key benefit of precision medicine is that drugs may be repurposed or may already exist to treat specific subsets of infected individuals. For example, one critical outcome for COVID-19 infection is the onset of a cytokine storm, in which the body's immune system gets caught in a positive feedback loop, leading to shock and rapid failure of multiple organs. There are existing drugs for treating cytokine storm syndrome, but practitioners have no clear guidelines if such treatments are beneficial or destructive. If the individual is not in a hyperinflammatory state, the administration of these drugs could cripple their immune response, leading to increased viral load. Plasma biomarker patterns of proteins and metabolites hold potential to identify impending cytokine storms and other lethal outcomes.  To advance precision medicine for COVID-19 treatment, this work will generate large-scale omics data and evaluate levels of proteins and metabolites for plasma drawn from 350 COVID-19 positive cases and 750 normal controls. These data will be immediately released to the research community. Our research team will take a concerted multipronged approach for analyzing these data using diverse complementary techniques. Our labs' research focuses on the discovery of combinations of genes and proteins expressing synchronously and the associations of these combinations with traits of interest, as well as endophenotype discovery. In addition to thorough single analyte analyses, this research will employ three computational strategies to reveal combinations of factors defining patterns: 1) network modeling, 2) explainable-AI systems biology, and 3) linear programming. These intensive analyses will require significant computational resources and we will utilize Summit at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, for these tasks.  The comprehensive protein and metabolite profiles, based on a large cohort of COVID-19 cases and normal controls, along with our rigorous interrogation of these data for complex biomarker patterns indicative of patient outcomes, hold unprecedented potential to drive solid advances in precision medicine and to reduce mortality rates due to COVID-19. In addition, this research will provide an agile model for use when tackling other heterogeneous diseases plaguing humankind, as well as novel viruses that may arise in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic is exceptionally detrimental for the elderly, as they comprise 80% of deaths in the US and are at elevated risks for serious physical and mental health issues due to social isolation. COVID-19 is a heterogeneous disease that exhibits a range of diverse symptoms, demanding a precision medicine approach in which treatments for each distinct outcome are developed, biomarker patterns to diagnose patients for classification into an outcome group are defined, and new candidate drug targets are generated for each outcome. In order to lay the foundation for a precision medicine approach for treating COVID-19, this work will generate a highly-phenotyped large-scale omics dataset including blood proteomics and metabolomics from 350 COVID-19 positive cases and 750 uninfected healthy individuals and will intensely analyze these data using diverse complementary high-performance computing techniques, including network modeling with enhanced accuracy, explainable-AI systems biology incorporating diverse data, and pioneering linear programming producing optimal associations, thereby illuminating complex proteomic and metabolomic biomarker patterns associated with each critical disease outcome and generating novel candidate drug targets.",A Multipronged Interrogation of Large-Scale Omics Data to Reveal COVID-19 Pathways,10202278,RF1AG053303,"['2019-nCoV', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood coagulation', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ebola', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Programming', 'Mental Health', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Mutate', 'Natural Selections', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Pneumonia', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Shock', 'Smell Perception', 'Social isolation', 'Solid', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'complex data ', 'computing resources', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'design', 'diverse data', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'fighting', 'human old age (65+)', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'physical conditioning', 'precision drugs', 'precision medicine', 'protein metabolite', 'receptor', 'response', 'statistics', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'trait', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,650002,-0.020029293403363
"Optimizing prediction of preschool psychopathology from brain: behavior markers of emotion dysregulation from birth: A computational, developmental cognitive neuroscience approach PROJECT SUMMARY: Internalizing/externalizing psychopathologies are identifiable by age 3, with neurodevelopmental risk markers evident in infants. Despite powerful implications for prevention, clinical impact has been minimal. We use innovative computational and epidemiologic data science methods to accelerate clinical translation of neurodevelopmental discovery during infancy towards generalizable risk prediction for preschool psychopathology. Our main objective is generating a pragmatic clinical risk calculator for public health use, the Mental Health Risk Calculator for Young Children (MHRiskCalc-YC). To achieve necessary power and precision, we create the Mental Health, Earlier Synthetic Cohort (MHESC), pooling multiple extramural cohorts at Washington University and Northwestern University to form the first clinically- enriched “synthetic” neuroimaging cohort for generation of neurodevelopmentally-based clinical risk algorithms (N=1,020, followed from birth-54 mos.). To maximize the risk calculator's clinical and research utility and cost effectiveness, we will generate a series of risk algorithms tailored to envisioned end-users, incorporating input from clinical stakeholders. Algorithms will also establish added value of pre-postnatal environmental factors in risk prediction, a crucial but understudied RDoC element. Aim 1 optimizes clinical feasibility and cost effectiveness by generating an MHRiskCalc-YC algorithm derived solely from commonly used survey data to optimize feasibility for future use in primary care settings. Aim 2 optimizes precision of prediction by establishing statistical and clinical incremental utility of more intensive assessment for future use in mental health specialty settings. This algorithm sequentially tests the added predictive value of methods of intermediate-high intensity (from direct assessments to EEG to MRI) for most precise, least burdensome risk prediction. The Aim 3 algorithm is optimized for future clinical research use in neurodevelopmental consortia, modeling the added value of MRI data to the Aim 1 algorithm. This mirrors “common” protocols of neuroimaging consortia and will also generate an empirically-derived best practices guide for consortia to optimize timing/ number of neuroimaging assessments. External validity will be established in the Baby Connectome Project (BCP). The MHESC capitalizes on an unprecedented, time-sensitive opportunity to accelerate scientific and clinical impact of multiple extramural activities that have been extensively pre-aligned. The public health impact of an infancy-based clinical risk prediction tool for preschool psychopathology has transformative potential for altering standard of care in early identification and prevention of mental disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Mental disorders are often early-onset chronic diseases, with brain and behavioral risk markers of common internalizing/externalizing problems evident in infancy. To accelerate translation, we will use multi-method imaging, behavioral and data science innovations to generate an infant mental health risk calculator for pragmatic public health use, derived from a clinically enriched “Mental Health Earlier-Synthetic Cohort” of 1,020 infants using established study samples (characterized from birth-54 months). Clinical prediction algorithms will deliver broadly useful tools for earlier prediction and prevention of mental disorder and parameters to inform when imaging methods will be most informative in large-scale neurodevelopmental studies.","Optimizing prediction of preschool psychopathology from brain: behavior markers of emotion dysregulation from birth: A computational, developmental cognitive neuroscience approach",10056737,R01MH121877,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Extramural Activities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Height', 'Infant', 'Interview', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Studies', 'Science', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effectiveness', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early onset', 'emotion dysregulation', 'epidemiologic data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'mental disorder prevention', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary care setting', 'protective factors', 'relating to nervous system', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,1858980,-0.00844708561546802
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes.

"Refining and Validating Borderline Personality Disorder Phenotypes Through Factor Mixture Modeling The proposed research seeks to clarify the symptomatic heterogeneity of borderline personality disorder (BPD) by examining BPD phenotypes through advanced latent variable modeling. A second, innovative aim is to validate these findings through intensive longitudinal assessment in daily life. BPD is associated with high rates of emergency room visits and costly healthcare service utilization, affecting 10-20% of psychiatric outpatients and 20-40% of psychiatric inpatients. BPD also contributes to impaired social and occupational functioning and significant suicide risk, with 1 in 10 individuals with BPD completing suicide. Recent research has aimed to enhance treatment effectiveness for BPD by identifying prototypical patterns of symptom manifestation that may suggest ideographic treatment targets. However, no research has simultaneously included: a) a sufficiently large patient sample; b) ecologically sound validation of results; and c) use of appropriate statistical techniques. The proposed project builds on this research through two aims. Aim 1: Utilize a model comparison approach to identify BPD phenotypes in a large psychiatric outpatient sample assessed via semi-structured diagnostic interviews (Study 1). Aim 2: Validate the results of Study 1 by applying phenotype classification algorithms produced in Study 1 to a smaller sample of patients who have completed 21 days of momentary surveys on symptoms and clinical outcomes (Study 2). To address Aim 1, factor mixture modeling (FMM)—a novel, flexible, and integrative latent variable modeling approach—will be compared to standard factor analysis and latent class analysis in order to evaluate the dimensional and categorical structure of BPD. We expect a single-factor, multi-class FMM will best explain heterogeneity in BPD, over and above other sources of heterogeneity (e.g., gender, comorbidity). To address Aim 2, we will use a prototype-matching approach to algorithmically assign patients in the validation sample to phenotypes identified in Aim 1 and determine their predictive validity in terms of daily clinical outcomes. Results of this project will provide empirically grounded personalized prediction tools for BPD intervention and treatment development, in line with the NIMH’s goal of “developing, testing, and refining tools and methodologies… for personalized risk and trajectory prediction and intervention.” This fellowship will allow the applicant to receive tailored consultation from experts in methodology, data analysis, and BPD theory and assessment, as well as advanced statistical training and grantsmanship courses and workshops. This training will be enhanced by the resource-rich environment and explicit support of student research and funding provided by the Pennsylvania State University, as well as the support of Dr. Kenneth Levy and his lab. This promising young researcher will gain training in computational modeling, proficiency in working with “big data,” increased understanding of conceptual and nosological models of BPD, and further skills in disseminating research findings through publication and presentation, as vital steps towards an independent research career in translational clinical science. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to elucidate the underlying psychopathology of borderline personality disorder (BPD), a prevalent, costly, and deadly psychiatric condition, through the identification of ecologically valid phenotypes of the disorder. Accurate identification of BPD phenotypes promises to reveal patterns of symptoms that can be targeted in treatment development, improving treatment effectiveness for this impairing disorder.

"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9942495,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,173441,-0.0014970321830391502
"ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Gestational diabetes (GDM) rates are on the rise in the US, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. GDM is associated with higher rates of large for gestational age (LGA) infants, C-section, and serious perinatal complications, and increased long-term risks of Type 2 diabetes and morbidity in both mothers and infants. Women who get treatment for GDM are less likely to experience perinatal complications and give birth to LGA infants than those who do not; therefore, rapid detection of GDM may be critical to reducing perinatal complications and disparities in birth outcomes. GDM is normally diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks gestation, but clinically important insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction may be missed by not testing earlier. A metabolically unhealthy uterine environment in early pregnancy may lead to long-term negative impacts on mother and child, but how and when to test for insulin resistance and associated metabolic dysfunction in pregnancy is poorly defined. More data are needed on how glucose levels and other metabolic measures change across pregnancy to better evaluate women's metabolic risks and how those risks relate to perinatal and long-term outcomes. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and metabolic biomarker assays, we will describe detailed metabolic phenotype profiles over the course of pregnancy and examine how they are associated with perinatal and postpartum outcomes. We propose to recruit a diverse sample of 400 women in their first trimester from Kaiser Permanente Northwest and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii and to perform CGM, OGTT, and obtain biomarkers at 12 weeks, 20 weeks, and 28 weeks of gestation to examine how these measures relate to each other and to perinatal outcomes. Aim 1 and Aim 3 will assess the effects of CGM variables (Aim 1) and OGTT and other biomarkers (Aim 3) at each time point on the risk of LGA, other perinatal outcomes, and postpartum diabetes. Aim 2 will assess the relationship between CGM variables and diagnosis of GDM by OGTT, as well as the relationship between CGM variables and other metabolic biomarkers. We hypothesize that dysglycemia is just one marker of a much larger metabolic dysregulation that can be characterized through the work of this consortium. Characterizing a broader spectrum of metabolic dysregulation and its association with adverse perinatal outcomes will lead to improved screening regimens and treatments for pregnant women and better outcomes for both mothers and babies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy that increases the risk of pregnancy and birth complications. New tests may allow doctors to identify women with GDM earlier and more accurately than the tests currently being used, but we need to understand them better. We will recruit 400 pregnant women and screen them using both traditional and new GDM screening tools at 12, 20, and 28 weeks of pregnancy to determine how well these tools identify women who are at risk of complications and need treatment.","ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae",10021656,U01DK123791,"['Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'C-Peptide', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cesarean section', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dystocia', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fasting', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fracture', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'OGTT', 'Oral Diagnosis', 'Organogenesis', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Shoulder', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'Uterus', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomarker identification', 'delivery complications', 'early pregnancy', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fetal', 'glucose monitor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'mortality', 'neonatal death', 'obesogenic', 'offspring', 'perinatal complications', 'perinatal outcomes', 'postpartum outcome', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'primary outcome', 'racial minority', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'stillbirth', 'tool']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2020,662614,-0.00046180795183729817
"Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing 7. Project Summary/Abstract Adult human skin heals by developing fibrotic scar tissue, which can result in devastating disfigurement, growth restriction, and permanent functional loss. Despite a plethora of clinical options, no current treatment strategies successfully prevent or reverse this fibrotic process, and scars and their sequelae cost the United States over $20 billion every year. Progress towards the development of new therapies has been significantly hindered by a lack of understanding of the specific cell populations responsible for scarring. In 2015, our group reported that Engrailed-1 (En-1) lineage-positive fibroblasts (EPFs) are responsible for the vast majority of dorsal scar production in postnatal mice. In early fetal gestation, mice heal scarlessly via skin regeneration, an ideal outcome mediated by En-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts (ENFs; the predominant fetal fibroblast). However, it has not been established if ENFs contribute to postnatal wound healing. In this proposal, we explore for the first time the postnatal conversion of ENFs to pro-fibrotic EPFs (postnatally-derived EPFs; pEPFs) within the wound environment. First, histology, immunohistochemistry, and wounding in a novel transgenic mouse model will be used to study the conversion of ENFs to pEPFs during wound healing. By examining the behavior of ENF subpopulations (derived from papillary dermis, reticular dermis, and hypodermis) in the wound environment and confirming our findings in a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model of En-1 activation, we will precisely define the ENF population that gives rise to pro-fibrotic pEPFs. Second, we will establish the specific wound environment cues that drive ENF-to-EPF transition. Given that mechanical forces are known to modulate both scar burden and fibroblast activity, we will use in vitro and in vivo models to examine the effects of mechanical environment on En-1 activation. We will further use transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling to explore the role of mechanotransduction signaling in ENF-to-EPF transition and pEPF function. Third, having established a mechanotransduction mechanism underlying En-1 activation in wound ENFs, we will inhibit mechanotransduction signaling with the goal of blocking ENF-to-EPF transition. Specifically, we will assess whether blocking mechanotransduction results in ENF-mediated wound healing with reduced fibrosis. Our ultimate translational goal is to develop therapeutics that target fibrogenic fibroblasts to promote regenerative healing. Collectively, the proposed work will significantly enhance our understanding of the key molecular and cellular determinants of cutaneous scarring, inform the development of novel anti-scarring therapies, and shed light on the cellular origin of dermal scarring fibroblasts. 8. Project Narrative Scarring is the end result of injury in adult human skin and results in an enormous financial and medical burden for our society. There are currently no effective molecular therapies that prevent scarring or its sequelae, and development of therapeutics has been hindered by lack of understanding of the precise cell populations that mediate fibrosis in wound healing. Therefore, we propose to explore the contribution of a specific fibroblast subpopulation (Engrailed-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts; ENFs) in fibrotic wound healing, in order to inform novel directions for targeted treatments that minimize scarring and promote regenerative wound healing.",Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing,9933446,R01GM136659,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Surface', 'Behavior', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cues', 'Cultured Cells', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Dermis', 'Development', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV', 'Dorsal', 'Elements', 'Engraftment', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fiber', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hair follicle structure', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hydrogels', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Papillary', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surface', 'Tamoxifen', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transposase', 'United States', 'Verteporfin', 'Visual', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'functional loss', 'healing', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanical force', 'mechanotransduction', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skin regeneration', 'skin wound', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue culture', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'wound', 'wound bed', 'wound environment', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,317823,-0.02993112409167637
"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,9831645,R01MH114028,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Paraphilias', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Social Processes', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'aggression prevention', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data structure', 'early childhood', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'mental state', 'morphometry', 'multimodal data', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'pediatric trauma', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2020,698835,-0.016265089435853915
"Mentoring and research in applying digital technologies to prevent chronic Illnesses ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For this K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) award, my goals are: 1) to become an international leader in the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases by applying emerging digital technologies and social media; 2) to conduct high-impact research in testing innovative, cost-effective lifestyle interventions (physical activity) using machine leaning; and 3) to provide a hih quality mentorship and training environment that supports the conduct of high POR impact research in cardiovascular and diabetes prevention. This K24 award will allow me to take on a broader and more formal mentorship role not only in the School of Nursing but also throughout the University of California, San Francisco campus. The overall goals of the new research in this application are to develop decision rule algorithms and quantitative models to optimize real-time predictions of future physical activity intervention adherences and to pilot test these algorithms and models in an intervention trial. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the extent to which baseline factors can predict adherence in self-monitoring (using mobile apps and wearing advanced accelerometers); 2) to determine the extent to which early app-based self-monitoring and evaluation (e.g., advanced accelerometers and diary use, and step counts in the first few weeks) can be optimized to make real-time predictions of future treatment failures; 3) to assess the feasibility of the ""Physical Activity Plus"" intervention using developed real-time prediction models (developed in Aim 2), compared to a ""regular physical activity"" intervention, for changes in total daily steps and duration of moderate and intensive physical activity over a three-month period. To tailor intervention intensity, we will evaluate the frequency of study visits and real-time feedback to minimize treatment failures and maximize adherence. Junior investigators in the POR have adapted digital mobile technologies as part of their research tools and have generated large volumes of continuous data. However, only a few training opportunities are available in this research area; in particular, for methods to rigorously and fully utilize the richness of the data collected. Therefore, the proposed K24 application will also meet these mentees' urgent needs across disciplines.

"Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal responds to RFA-MH-17-612, “Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34).” We have shown in several randomized trials that family-focused therapy (FFT) for symptomatic youth at high-risk for bipolar disorder - consisting of psychoeducation and family communication and problem solving skills training - is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in hastening symptomatic recovery. However, between 50%-60% of high-risk youth still have residual mood symptoms and functional impairment after 18 weeks of FFT. In our prior studies, two constructs have emerged as predictors of lack of response to treatment: mood instability in the child and expressed emotion (EE) in parents (i.e., frequent critical comments or hostility). In adolescents (ages 12-18) with a parent with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, we hypothesize that augmenting FFT with frequent and targeted interventions in the home setting through a Smartphone app (MyCoachConnect, or MCC) will (a) have a greater and more rapid impact than standard FFT on the targeted mechanisms of mood instability in adolescents and EE in parents, and (b) as a result, enhance symptom resolution and functioning in adolescents. To be eligible, adolescents must score high on parent-rated measures of mood instability, and have at least one parent who is high-EE by speech sample coding criteria. The MCC app will record weekly open speech samples from parents and children and daily and weekly mood ratings from adolescents. The app assessments will be fed back to the FFT clinician, who will use this information to “push” recommendations for mood regulation, communication, and problem-solving strategies (linked to the FFT modules) for parents and youth. In year 1, we will conduct an open trial (n=25) to determine (a) the feasibility and acceptability of FFT with mobile coaching (FFT-MCC), as given by clinicians in community settings, and (b) associations between online/speech feature proxies of the targets (mood instability and EE as measured weekly by MCC) and standard measures of the targets. In years 2 and 3 we will conduct a 75- case RCT in which families are assigned to FFT with MCC skills coaching, FFT with MCC assessments only, with no coaching; or FFT Only, without MCC. We hypothesize that FFT-MCC will be acceptable to parents, adolescents and clinicians, and more effective than FFT without MCC coaching or FFT-Only in engaging the targets of mood instability and EE and promoting improvements in adolescents' mood symptoms and quality of life over 27 weeks. The study will facilitate the translation of a technological augmentation to an evidence-based family intervention, with the goal of increasing treatment access among families with mood disorders. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a 12-session evidence- based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC “real time” assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills. We hypothesize that the augmented version of FFT (FFT-MCC) will be more effective than FFT without coaching/informational alerts in altering treatment targets and in stabilizing youths' mood symptoms and quality of life.",Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders,9940913,R34MH117200,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Back', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Family', 'Family Relationship', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Hostility', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'community clinic', 'community setting', 'effectiveness trial', 'emerging adult', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'girls', 'high risk', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'mobile application', 'mood regulation', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'psychoeducation', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'skills training', 'smartphone Application', 'standard measure', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy design', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'usability', 'volunteer']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R34,2020,273000,-0.026322155048244165
"Multi-tissue high-throughput proteomic and genomic study in Parkinson's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, affecting more than 6 million people worldwide, with the prevalence projected to double in the next few decades. Despite the improvements in high-throughput genomics and proteomics that have significantly facilitated the advancement of biomarker discovery in other neurodegenerative diseases, there are no reliable biomarkers for PD. Currently, the PD diagnosis relies almost entirely on clinical examination. There are several reasons for the lack of reliable biomarkers in PD including most studies have been focused on single molecules in one tissue, small samples sizes and a lack of independent replication cohorts. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging a unique resource that includes quantitative proteomic analysis of ~1,300 proteins from CSF and plasma of clinically diagnosed PD patients coupled with validation in brain samples from autopsy-confirmed PD cases. We will pair the proteomic data with novel and powerful unbiased (hypothesis-free) genomic approaches to select the most plausible candidates for targeted replication studies. This large-scale screening of ~3,110 samples could identify biomarkers of known molecular pathways involving PD or with a clear genetic connection to PD risk. To achieve these goals, we propose three aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify proteins differentially expressed in PD patients in plasma, CSF or brain tissue. We plan to carry out a quantitative proteomic analysis using Somalogic SOMAscan® assay of plasma (n=600) and CSF (n=200) from clinically diagnosed PD patients and of brain tissue (n=200) from autopsy-confirmed PD patients. We will also evaluate CSF (n=740), plasma (n=410) and brain tissue (n=114) from an independent cohort of healthy individuals and CSF (n=275), plasma (n=234) and brain tissue (n=345) from AD patients. We expect to obtain precise and accurate levels of a large number of proteins across multiple tissues in the analyzed samples. Specific Aim 2: To prioritize candidate biomarkers based on an integrative analysis of proteomic and genome-wide genotyping data using Mendelian Randomization (MR). We plan to integrate proteomic and GWAS data to identify protein quantitative loci (pQTLs) and apply MR approaches to determine proteins involved in the causal pathway of PD. Using this approach, we will be able to select reliable PD biomarker candidates for validation. Specific Aim 3: To determine whether genetic and proteomic data improves biomarker specificity. We will ascertain whether combining proteomic and genomic data could increase biomarker accuracy. We expect to uncover a genome-proteome network that may provide a basis for novel approaches to diagnostic and pharmacotherapeutic applications in PD. Narrative Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorders in humans. Currently, there are no reliable, sensitive and specific biomarkers identified in PD to date.

"A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child gut inflammation, growth, and development PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Lin is a research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley in Professor John (Jack) Colford's group. She completed her PhD in Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University in 2012. Since 2010, she has worked as the coordinating microbiologist for the WASH Benefits study, a large-scale, multi- country cluster randomized trial evaluating the impact of water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutritional interventions on child health, with a focus on gut inflammation. This research and training plan builds on her strong interdisciplinary background at the nexus of microbiology, immunology, and global health. Gaining experience in epidemiology and biostatistics will facilitate her transition to a `bench to population' independent investigator at UC Berkeley and will ultimately enable her to achieve her long-term career goal to become a global health leader in the evaluation of antenatal and early life interventions to improve child health. Environment: UC Berkeley has a long history of conducting innovative and groundbreaking research advancing epidemiological and biostatistical theory and application in international health. To achieve her career goal, Dr. Lin seeks training in (1) epidemiology, with a focus on causal inference methods (in particular, marginal structural models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation) (2) biostatistics and (3) child stress and development. To achieve these goals, Dr. Lin has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team based at UC Berkeley. Jack Colford (primary mentor) will guide her training in epidemiological theory and application. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor) will guide her training in biostatistics and causal inference methods including models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Lia Fernald (co-mentor) will guide her training in child development and stress. Research Project: Early life linear growth faltering is associated with impaired development, but its underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood. Subclinical intestinal inflammation and damage affects children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment. In Aim 1, Dr. Lin will determine the association between maternal stress and inflammation during pregnancy and subsequent measures of child gut inflammation and permeability. In Aim 2, she will evaluate the relationship between antenatal stress and inflammation and future child linear growth and development. She proposes to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate the potential pathways from antenatal stress and inflammation to child gut inflammation, linear growth faltering, and poor development. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare Dr. Lin for a successful R01-level application to investigate potential downstream effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child stress, inflammation, and susceptibility to infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Widely pervasive subclinical inflammation and damage of the small intestine is observed in children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and permeability and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment in infants from low-income countries. Understanding these critical pathways will be an important contribution to public health because it will enable the identification of key biological markers to identify prospectively at-risk children, to evaluate the efficacy of interventions, and to suggest potential intervention targets to improve child linear growth and development trajectories; we propose to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate these critical pathways in children living in rural Bangladesh.","A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child gut inflammation, growth, and development",9989761,K01AI136885,"['5 year old', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'C-reactive protein', 'California', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Country', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hygiene', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Mannitol', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neopterin', 'Nutritional', 'Observational Study', 'Orosomucoid', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peroxidases', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Small Intestines', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Villous Atrophy', 'Water', 'Work', 'absorption', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'antenatal', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'cytokine', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'global health', 'improved', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innovation', 'low income country', 'maternal stress', 'neurodevelopment', 'oral vaccine', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prospective', 'repository', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'therapy development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2020,135454,-0.02673532985266509
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder.

"Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS Abstract:  The primary objective of this K01 application is to provide research training and mentorship to the candidate to enable her to become an independent medical rehabilitation researcher. The candidate has clinical experience in Physical Therapy and doctoral training in basic neurobiology and is transitioning to a new clinical research area investigating balance and gait in a neurodegenerative disorder called Fragile X Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) which occurs in some premutation (PM) carriers of the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The short term goals are to develop an early detection model for FXTAS and identify additional molecular risk factors for developing this disorder. The plan has 3 aims: 1) To identify quantitative markers of balance and gait impairments in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, 2) To determine the impact of executive function and cognitive interference on balance and gait function in PM carriers with and without FXTAS, and 3) to determine the relationship between age, sex, executive function, and FMR1 molecular variables and the presence and severity of balance and gait impairment in PM carriers with and without FXTAS. The candidate’s long term scientific goal is to become a leading independent research scientist in movement neuroscience and neurological disorders and in the precise identification of balance and gait dysfunction in FXTAS from the earliest stage. In order to reach these goals the candidate needs to develop expertise in patient outcomes and neuroepidemiology research. The candidate’s short term goals which form the basis for this five year K development plan include training in 1) large scale subject recruitment, data management and advanced biostatistics, 2) balance and gait analysis and application to clinical trials in movement disorders, 3) design, implementation and analysis of large scale epidemiological studies and 4) introduction to rehabilitation intervention and clinical trial research methodology. Results of this research will help clarify neurological mechanisms underlying balance and gait deficits in FXTAS, establish reliable and quantitative outcomes measures of motor impairment, and provide data for future clinical rehabilitation trials. This research will be the first step in characterizing the longitudinal history of motor dysfunction in FXTAS from its earliest stages, thus paving the way for establishing disease monitoring and modifying strategies in premutation carriers. This proposal is relevant to the NIH Research Plan on FXS and Associated Disorders which includes the following goals: 2.2 validation of quantitative instruments to detect early clinical signs of FXTAS and its progression, 2.3 identification of molecular and clinical risk factors in individuals associated with penetrance of FXTAS, and 2.5 defining genotype, including FMR1 molecular factors, and clinical phenotype relationships in FXTAS. Over one million people in the US carry a premutation expansion in the Fragile X gene. A significant portion of these individuals will experience debilitating symptoms of a neurodegenerative disorder known as fragile X- associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) including balance deficits, falls and progressive disability. This proposal addresses a critical need to identify early indicators of FXTAS onset in order to provide earlier intervention, including preventative and rehabilitative treatments, to delay disease progression, reduce the morbidity associated with falls and functional disability, and improve quality of life. This research will also provide quantitative outcome measures that may be used in future clinical trials.",Impact of Cognition on Balance and Gait Markers for FXTAS,9963329,K01HD088762,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'CGG repeat', 'CGG repeat expansion', 'Cerebellar Ataxia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'FXTAS', 'Family', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuroepidemiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Posture', 'Predictive Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'data management', 'design', 'disability', 'disabling symptom', 'epidemiology study', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'gait examination', 'improved', 'instrument', 'male', 'men', 'motor disorder', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex']",NICHD,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2020,128408,-0.005093232519546422
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up. Project Narrative/Relevance Metabolic syndrome is a major public health problem that affects over one in three American adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer.

"Modeling and Assessment of Maternal Uteroplacental Circulation During Pregnancy ABSTRACT In this proposal I am interested in developing a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling approach for volumetric assessment of human uteroplacental blood flow in vivo. The placenta is an organ that exchanges nutrients and oxygen between the maternal circulation and the growing fetus. In the United States, about 3.4% of pregnancies per year are affected by hypertensive pregnancy disorders (HPD) such as preeclampsia (PE), which have been found to carry both fetal and maternal risk. Associated placental pathologies are believed to be linked to alterations in maternal arterial remodeling. Currently, Doppler ultrasound (US) is the primary method of assessing flow to the placenta from the uterine artery (UtA). Clinical studies have shown a relationship between high UtA flow resistance and risk of adverse pregnancy outcome late in gestation, but it has not been reliable as an early gestation screening tool. In order to improve predictive technologies for reliable risk assessment assessment of HPD, more research into the relationship between vessel structure and function in the UtA is needed. I hypothesize that CFD modeling can be a useful tool for investigating possible pathophysiological mechanisms of HPD by simulating complex hemodynamics of the maternal vascular system including pressure, wall shear stress, and pulse wave velocity. I plan to set up various 1D CFD simulations to understand the hemodynamic parameters of normal versus abnormal pregnancies. Then, I will validate the simulations with 4D flow MRI acquired from an in vitro flow phantom and a cohort of normal and hypertensive pregnant women. I anticipate that the results of this investigation can advance scientific knowledge regarding the progression of early HPD phenotypes to adverse pregnancy outcomes. This CFD study can also demonstrate the extent to which patient-specific hemodynamic simulations can be reliable for future improvement of clinical management. This training experience will provide opportunities to build my expertise in cardiovascular physiology, fluid mechanics, medical imaging, data analysis, and clinical care. I will be publishing articles on my CFD/4D flow MRI findings and communicating the impact of this work in medicine at various internal and external symposia. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of award-winning experts and the University of Pennsylvania in cardiovascular MRI (Walter Witschey), fluid mechanics and computational modeling (Paris Perdikaris), maternal fetal medicine (Nadav Schwartz) and cardiovascular physiology (Victor Ferrari). PROJECT NARRATIVE The human placenta is an understudied organ believed to play a critical role in pregnancy health and the pathophysiology of hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Current technologies like ultrasound are limited in its ability to assess complex hemodynamics, and clinical studies have not yet found reliable biomarkers of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We will develop a computational fluid dynamic model of the maternal vessels delivering blood to the placenta and validate it with magnetic resonance imaging to characterize uteroplacental structure and function, providing future avenues for new predictive biomarkers of pregnancy health.",Modeling and Assessment of Maternal Uteroplacental Circulation During Pregnancy,9991192,F31HD100171,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doppler Ultrasound', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electric Capacitance', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Navier–Stokes equations', 'Nutrient', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Paris, France', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placentation', 'Play', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Uteroplacental Circulation', 'Uterus', 'Variant', 'Vascular System', 'Velocimetries', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'arterial remodeling', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'fetal', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'maternal risk', 'neural network', 'non-invasive imaging', 'phantom model', 'predictive marker', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pressure', 'screening', 'shear stress', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'symposium', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,-0.015186797765008541
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9928464,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell proliferation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,653362,-0.0006481804335007303
"Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents. PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Children and adolescents often grow up in the face of substantial developmental stress (i.e. trauma). While for some, this shifts the developmental trajectory to that of mental and general health disorders, others are resilient. Most research on developmental psychopathology is focused on risk while little is known on the mechanisms that confer resilience. The current study aims to identify biological (genomic, immune), psychological and cognitive mechanisms that underpin resilience in youth as defined by having low mood- anxiety and suicidal outcomes in youth with substantial developmental stress exposure (i.e. trauma and family history of depression). Elucidating resilience mechanisms has huge clinical implications as it will improve stratification of risk to develop depression and/or suicidal behavior, and could identify biological, psychological and cognitive targets that can inform development of future preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience, reducing the mental and general health adverse outcomes associated with childhood adversity. The study capitalizes on a large dataset of genotyped youths from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that have been comprehensively phenotyped for cognitive performance and psychopathology, and that reported substantial trauma exposure. The proposed research integrates genomic and cognitive data with clinical measures used to define resilience in cross sectional analysis of ~9500 PNC youths (Aim 1); incorporates longitudinal data of depression and suicide measures, pulled from electronic medical record in a subset of ~750 PNC youths (Aim 2); and relies on prospective data collection that includes immune profiling of selected PNC individuals to allow identification of immune signature of resilience (Aim 3). Integration of genomic with clinical, cognitive and immune data will allow predictive modeling, and Big Data driven analysis will allow identification of resilience mechanisms. The candidate is a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist physician scientist who is committed to translational research in youth at risk for psychiatric conditions. His overarching career goal is to develop methods for early identification of subclinical phenotypes before the onset of major psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression and suicide attempts) and, through neuroscience informed interventions, divert the developmental trajectory from that of risk to that of resilience. The career development plan capitalizes on a multidisciplinary mentorship team. It involves one-on one mentoring with the primary “clinical research” mentor as well as the genomic, biostatistical, neurocognitive and immune system expert co- mentors, integrated with hands on research supervision in data collection and statistical analysis, and didactic coursework and workshops. The program is tailored to meet research and training aims. The project will be conducted in the fostering environment of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, that will provide the academic mentorship and the required resources to execute the research and training aims, allowing the candidate to launch an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood adversities impose risk to general and mental health development, including youth depression and suicidal behavior, still most children are resilient. Through integration of genetic, clinical, cognitive and demographic data from research data and medical records, this study will identify mechanisms that underpin resilience in a generalizable large sample of community youth with substantial exposure to adversity.

"Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants PROJECT SUMMARY Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening, gastrointestinal (GI) emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. ""Leaky gut"", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal permeability (IP), is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC in preterm neonates. Early detection of leaky gut is essential to identify infants at risk for NEC to prevent and reduce disease severity. No clinical factor, routine laboratory test or biomarker alone or in combination have been described that identify preterm neonates with impaired intestinal barrier function who at increased risk for NEC. The goal of this study is to develop a rapid, non-invasive screening tool to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. We recently revealed rapid maturation of the intestinal barrier is strongly associated with clinical factors such as early breastmilk feeding, less antibiotic exposure and later post-menstrual age, and significantly higher abundance and metabolic activities of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Although the butyrate producing Clostridiales have been implicated in strengthening the intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing intestinal inflammation, it is unknown whether butyrate and potentially other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with neonatal intestinal barrier maturation. Our preliminary data revealed butyrate production pathways, in particular Pyruvate/Acetyl-CoA pathway are significantly more abundant in low IP subjects. In this study, we propose to validate a substantiated measure of fecal microbial and/or metabolic biomarkers combined with associated neonatal factors for a rapid, non-invasive screening test. We postulate that the level(s) of metabolic activities, particularly butyrate production and potentially other SCFAs via increased colonization of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium, are associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates. To address our hypothesis, we will leverage existed stool samples collected from a cohort of ~200 preterms (<33 weeks), for whom both microbiota (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and IP (urine non-metabolized sugar probes lactulose and rhamnose) are available, and propose 2 aims: 1) to determine fecal metabolic activities associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestation; and 2) to identify and characterize butyrate-producing bacteria associated with intestinal permeability in preterm neonates during the first 7-10 days of life. At the completion of the study, we will determine the biomarkers associated with healthy intestinal barrier functions and the discriminatory scheme for accurate classification of high or low IP group. Our long-term goal is to conduct a randomize clinical trial of rationally designed intervention for NEC early prevention. Refinement of the screening tool will identify infants with aberrant leaky gut, an essential prerequisite for subsequent rational design of novel strategies such as clinical trials of probiotics to promote healthy intestinal barrier functions to reduce NEC incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE ""Leaky gut"", is the proximate cause of susceptibility to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening, gastrointestinal emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. This proposal will develop and validate a rapid, non-invasive screening test incorporating microbiome-based markers and associated neonatal factors, to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. The results of this study will support clinical trials aimed to optimize intestinal maturation and to reduce the burden of NEC complications. This study will address major knowledge gaps of the intestinal microenvironment in preterm infants, and ultimately lead to improved strategies to manage neonatal gastrointestinal health, improve children’s health and quality of life, all which are within the mission of NIDDK.",Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants,10018932,R21DK123674,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Butyrates', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Milk', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Leaky Gut', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Necrosis', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Pyruvate', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Urine', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'early screening', 'feeding', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'insight', 'intestinal barrier', 'intestinal epithelium', 'intestinal maturation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preterm newborn', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sex', 'stool sample', 'sugar', 'supervised learning', 'therapy design']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2020,193125,-0.010909577254842007
