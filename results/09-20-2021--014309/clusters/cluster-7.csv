"ADNI Psychometrics: Machine Learning to discern Natural History Aim 2 Supplement Project Summary/Abstract This supplement is to a funded R01 called ADNI Psychometrics. This Supplement builds on the Second Specific Aim of the funded parent grant. That Aim focused on characterizing brain structure and functioning for people with different cognitively- defined subgroups of Alzheimer's disease. The Supplement adds one technique for analyzing the longitudinal structural data we are already analyzing. The new technique for structural data is machine learning. We have the opportunity to collaborate with a talented faculty member in Biomedical Informatics who has specific expertise in machine learning approaches to anatomical data (J Gennari). Dr. Genarri will supervise machine learning approaches to complement the various analytical approaches we already have underway for the longitudinal structural imaging data of Aim 2. Longitudinal imaging data are particularly significant, as any differences we find in the evolution of brain structure over time across subgroups supports the notion that the subgroups have distinct natural histories, which in turn goes a long way towards the provocative conclusion that these subgroups of “Alzheimer's disease” represent distinct conditions. Machine learning approaches to these data were not envisioned in the initial proposal, but represent a particularly valuable complementary approach that may identify similarities and differences in trajectories of the evolution of brain structure that would not be apparent using the more traditional analytic pipelines we outlined in the proposal. This then is the perfect fit for an Administrative Supplement – this is an opportunity to enhance the value of the parent study by adding new expertise to investigate in a complementary and valuable fashion a question that was already addressed by the parent grant. This Supplement builds on the same infrastructure and questions asked in Aim 2, but augments our analytical armamentarium with novel machine learning approaches. Project Narrative This Supplement proposal builds on the second aim of R01 AG 029672,  'ADNI Psychometrics (P Crane, PI) , which is to use ADNI's rich neuroimaging data to compare metabolism and brain structure correlates of cognitively defined Alzheimer's disease subgroups. This proposal would add machine learning approaches for the longitudinal structural imaging data to the analytic strategies already being pursued by the investigators. This Supplement Proposal would substantially augment the scientific value of the overall study.",ADNI Psychometrics: Machine Learning to discern Natural History Aim 2 Supplement,9933184,R01AG029672,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Memory', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Parents', 'Psychometrics', 'Published Comment', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'disorder subtype', 'executive function', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'longitudinal analysis', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'supervised learning']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,281279,-0.011437764134188542
"Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome Project Summary/Abstract The high risk of neurodevelopmental impairments is a major concern for parents and clinicians caring for premature babies. Annually, approximately 22,000 very preterm infants (i.e. ≤32 weeks gestational age) in the United States develop cognitive deficits. Efforts to target interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental sequelae are hampered by our current inability to diagnose disabilities before the age of 3 to 5 years. Research supports the notion that cognitive deficits may result from a perturbation of neural connection and communication. Recent brain connectome studies in adults and older children show that abnormal network properties are useful as prognostic biomarkers. Many of these studies have exploited machine learning models based on brain connectome data for the prediction of a variety of neurological conditions, however this progress has not been fully extended to the preterm population. Our preliminary studies suggest that early and accurate prediction of cognitive deficits at an individual level is possible using machine learning models based on brain connectome features at term corrected age (CA). We have correctly classified 91.3% of very preterm infants at high risk of cognitive deficits with 90% specificity and 92.3% sensitivity. Our overall objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that can analyze integrated structural and functional brain connectome data obtained at term CA to make a prediction of later cognitive deficits in very preterm infants. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning techniques analyzing integrated structural and functional brain connectome features at birth can predict cognitive deficits at 2 years CA at an individual level in very preterm infants with accuracy of greater than 90%, exceeding the performance of current classical multivariate analyses. The two specific aims to test the central hypothesis are: 1) Develop and implement a machine learning model to extract high-level brain connectome features and 2) Develop and validate a machine learning framework to predict cognitive deficits. On completion of the first aim, we will explicate the brain connectome, and extract high-dimensional connectome features that best represent the brain connectome. In the second aim, the machine learning model we proposed will be applied in predicting both cognitive deficit (i.e. 2-class classification) and cognitive scores on a continuous scale (i.e., regression) at 2 years CA. To quantify the model's discrimination, we will also validate its performance in data that are not used for the model development, and compare with the current conventional multivariate approach. The proposed research is significant because it will increase scientific knowledge about the developing brain connectome in very preterm infants and facilitate earlier identification of babies at high risk of neurodevelopmental deficits, allowing timely clinical interventions for optimal cognitive outcome. Project Narrative Babies born before 32 weeks' gestational age are at a very high risk of developing cognitive deficits, which may impact their brain function in many ways, including life-long learning difficulties. Fortunately, infant brains are highly malleable, so it is important to identify those at highest risk as early as possible to allow effective early interventions. We propose to apply a reliable, accurate and sensitive artificial intelligence approach based on state-of-the-art brain MRI to allow identification of babies at highest risk of learning difficulties.",Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome,9759972,R21HD094085,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Premature Infant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'disability', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'interest', 'life-long learning', 'medical complication', 'model development', 'neonate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2019,238500,-0.0014180820301407165
"Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models Project abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. A critical gap in the treatment of PD patients is that there is no clinically adopted method to predict an individual's progression rate. A predictor would enable the enrichment of disease modifying drug trials with fast progressors likely to show changes in the short duration of a clinical trial and enable a more informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops a composite biomarker of progression rate using the connectivity information provided by resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) and deep learning. Deep learning (DL) is well suited to form predictive models because it learns both an optimal hierarchy of features and how to combine them for accurate prediction. In rs-fMRI the blood-oxygen level dependent signal can be analyzed to infer connectivity throughout the brain. Traditionally, connectivity has been computed as the correlation between average regional activation time courses. However correlation based connectivity is prone to inferring spurious connections due to its inability to distinguish indirect from direct connectivity and inability to distinguish bidirectional from unidirectional connectivity. A causal connectivity approach can discern these differences and thereby provide a more faithful characterization of the true neurobiological connectivity. The existing literature suggests connectivity, particularly causal connectivity, from rs-fMRI can inform the estimation of PD progression, but the attempt to predict progression rate with causal connectivity in a DL model is unique to this project.  This research develops several distinct approaches for building a progression rate predictor and apply them to three datasets including: the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset, the NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) dataset, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's prospective imaging extension to the NINDS PBDP. In these studies, individual progression rates have been tracked over multiple years using multiple clinical measures. First, causal and correlative measures will be generated regionally and used with a DL model to create a baseline predictor of progression rate. Second, voxel- level causal measures will be generated as the increased granularity is expected to improve prediction accuracy. Third, since purely data-driven DL methods can be sensitive to dataset limitations, such as insufficient subjects and noise, these limitations will be addressed by developing a new structural connectivity regularization approach that constrains causal connectivity by the subject's own diffusion MRI. This regularization method will be general and likely applicable for building predictors for other neurological disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. This proposal will yield both DL models for predicting progression rate and a novel method to calculate constrained causal connectivity. All predictive models, composite neuroimaging biomarkers of progression rate and software will be publicly disseminated for ready incorporation by the scientific and clinical communities. Project narrative Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and this debilitating and incurable disease has no known cure. A cure for PD remains elusive due to the lack of clinically adopted predictors of progression rate, which if constructed would 1) hasten the discovery of disease modifying drugs by enriching clinical trials with fast progressors who likely will show changes over the trial, 2) allow for stratification of patients by progression rate in those trials, and 3) enable an informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops and validates distinct approaches to predict PD progression rate, identifies new biomarkers of progression rate, and yields a generalizable framework for constraining causal measures from fMRI with the subject's own structural connectivity that is readily repurposable for other neurological disorders with connectivity changes such as stroke and Alzheimer's.",Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models,9909889,F31NS115348,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Fiber', 'Florida', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'tractography']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2019,34014,0.0059034463593535215
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9695211,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,522460,0.045470830380726246
"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9698938,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multi-task learning', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,446909,0.012574783197467965
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9687747,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2019,163943,0.037498827503311495
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason for this is that most neuroimaging prediction studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple correlation relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, nonlinear relationships, or multi-site cross-validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with reference, and sparse regression can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, providing promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers and going beyond a descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain disease to individualized prediction. We will facilitate the translational biomarker identification by developing 3 novel data-driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment may affect covarying brain function and structure in mental disorder, by using different clinical measures as a reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction framework with aggregated feature selection techniques that is able to estimate clinical outcome more precisely, e.g., remission/relapse status of individual MDD patient after electroconvulsive treatment(ECT) using baseline brain imaging and demographic measures of 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep learning combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) or attention modules, to classify multiple groups of psychiatric disorders by incorporating dynamic functional measures. The proposed (Deep/Recurrent/Convolutional Neural Network, DNN/RNN/CNN) models will have enhanced interpretability that is able to trace back and discover the most predictive functional networks from input. All above proposed methods will be applied to big data containing both multimodal imaging and behavioral information (n~5000) pooled from existing studies, and our developed open-source toolboxes will be shared publicly. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, leading to earlier and more effective interventions, and laying the groundwork for a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep learning, supervised learning and functional dynamics, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, and to identify precise biomarkers that are able to predict clinical measures for new individuals and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting of a big data with imaging and behavioral info to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9818198,R01MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,399485,-0.006675254435541864
"Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Project Summary/Abstract: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Brain monitoring in critical care has grown dramatically over the past 20 years with the discovery that a large proportion of ICU patients suffer from subclinical seizures and seizure-like electrical events, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), detectable only by electroencephalography (EEG). This growth has created a crisis in critical care: It is clear that IIICAs damage the brain and cause permanent neurologic disability. Yet detection of IIICAs by expert visual review is often delayed suggesting we need better tools for real-time monitoring, to cope with the deluge of ICU EEG data. In other cases, IIICAs appear to be harmless epiphenomena, and many worry that increased awareness of IIICAs has created an epidemic of overly-aggressive prescribing of anticonvulsant drugs leading to preventable adverse events and costs. This crisis highlights critical unmet needs for automated EEG monitoring for IIICAs, and a better understanding of which types of IIICAs cause neural injury and warrant intervention. Causes of IIICAs range widely, from primary brain injuries like hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, to systemic medical illnesses like sepsis and uremia. Until recently, this massive clinical heterogeneity has been an insurmountable barrier to understanding the impact of IIICAs on neurologic outcome. However, recent advances in deep learning, coupled with the unprecedented availability of a massive dataset developed by our team over the last three years, makes it feasible for the first time to systematically study the relationship between IIICAs and neurologic outcomes. To meet the need for better monitoring tools and better models for understanding IIICAs, we will take a deep learning approach to leverage the as-yet untapped information in a massive ICU EEG dataset. We will pursue three Specific Aims: SA1: Comprehensively label all occurrences of IIICAs in a massive set of cEEG recordings, thus preparing the EEG data for training computers to detect IIICA patterns; SA2: Develop supervised DL algorithms to detect IIICAs as accurately as human experts, thus providing powerful tools for both research on IIICAs and for clinical brain monitoring; SA3: Estimate the effect of IIICAs on neurologic outcome: we will develop models to quantify effects of IIICAs on risk for disability after controlling for inciting illness and other clinical factors, and to predict effects of interventions to suppress IIICAs. This work will provide four crucial benefits to advance the field of precision critical care neurology, and by extension, our ability to provide optimal neurologic care for patients during critical illness. 1) Improved understanding of the clinical significance of seizure like IIICA states; 2) development of robust tools and algorithms for critical care brain telemetry; 3) a unique, massive, publicly available, thoroughly annotated dataset that will enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials. Project Narrative: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum RELEVANCE: Seizures and seizure-like brain activity, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), occur commonly in electroencephalogram recordings of brain activity in ICU patients, and simultaneously represent a preventable cause of brain injury and a common cause of over-treatment and iatrogenic harm to patients. Big Data and deep learning approaches have recently enabled advances in several fields of medicine, but have so far had little impact in ICU neuromedicine. This project will use Big Data and Deep Learning to advance the goal of protecting brain health in ICU patients, by 1) providing improved understanding of the clinical significance of IIICA states; 2) developing robust tools and algorithms for ICU brain telemetry; 3) creating a unique, massive, publicly available, annotated dataset to enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) developing a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials.",Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum,9769180,R01NS107291,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthetics', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Label', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurology', 'Nomenclature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Supervision', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uremia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'brain health', 'causal model', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'nerve injury', 'neurophysiology', 'overtreatment', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'real time monitoring', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,559137,-0.011320112535543443
"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  The goal of the parent grant is to delineate abnormalities in the development of structural and functional brain networks associated with executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders including attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the psychosis spectrum (PS). However, critical aspects of executive dysfunction remain unexplored. First, sex differences in executive function are substantial, and disorders with prominent executive dysfunction (such ADHD and psychosis) are more prevalent in males. Notably, the aims of the parent grant only proposed to examine executive dysfunction across males and females, and did not propose to examine how sex-specific network abnormalities relate to sex differences in executive function. Second, the parent grant focuses on the broad construct of executive function, which is composed of multiple specific cognitive domains including working memory, performance monitoring, set shifting, inhibition, and sustained attention. At present, the aims of the parent grant do not propose to identify specific links between brain networks and these component processes. In this supplement, we will fill these important gaps in the parent grant using advanced tools from network science and machine learning. To do this, we will capitalize upon an NIMH-funded longitudinal study of irritability in youth that provides highly relevant data and is nearly complete (n=200). Findings in this valuable dataset will be replicated in the parent grant as data accrues. Together, this supplement will provide novel insights regarding the network-level substrates of executive dysfunction and provide the candidate with a superb training experience in computational psychiatry. This training will position him to succeed in a top neuroscience graduate program. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. A greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. These novel clinical interventions would benefit public health by reducing disability and limiting the costs to society at large.",Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence,9841623,R01MH113550,"['Adolescence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Sex Differences', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Training', 'Youth', 'cost', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'experience', 'insight', 'male', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'programs', 'sex', 'sustained attention', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,84344,-0.005589080092261285
"Brain Science Compute Cluster Computational requirements of contemporary brain science research typically exceed financial and resource management limits of individual investigator laboratories. Many brain science research projects require analysis of large data sets with advanced statistical methods and anatomical reconstruction techniques. These methods require high speed computational and graphics engines operating in a multiple processor environments equipped with large capacity, high speed storage devices. An ongoing limitation in the Brown brain science effort at understanding neural processing is the lack of a contemporary and readily accessible high-speed computational resource.  We plan to replace an existing, but 5 year old and now outmoded, central computational resource that has outdated graphic processing units (GPU) and central processing units (CPU) and and limited storage that will serve the computational needs of a core group of brain science investigators at Brown without compromising individual access to stand-alone workstations. The requested computation equipment comprises 13 GPU nodes (total of 52 cores), 12 CPU nodes (288 cores) and 1.2 petabytes of disk storage, which will serve the needs of the assembled brain science researchers. The equipment will become integrated into Brown's high performance Compute Cluster, which has system software that automatically balances GPU and CPU usage, thereby ensuring maximum access to the computational resource for all users. Intensive 3D graphics are off- loaded either to GPUs or to client workstations, thereby further reducing the central computational load. Commercial or open-source software with an open operating environment will be used for analysis using standard and novel statistical and machine learning approaches to assess significance of large data sets.  This proposal details the architecture and benefits of a contemporary computational resource for the major and minor users, and more generally the Brown brain science community. The resource was designed to fill immediate and near-term computational and storage needs of a core group of Brown brain scientists. The system can be readily expansion as needs, either computational, storage, or new users, arise. Expansion of the existing core investigators group can occur easily since the computational power or storage capacity of the system can be readily enhanced at relatively low cost.  The flexible nature of the system will serve a variety of research needs of the Brown brain science community. The computational resource is expected to bring together researchers at Brown working on the common problem of neural processing. Relevance Gaining insights into the neural and brain mechanisms that underlie normal brain function and malfunction in disease requires analysis of large and complex data sets related to behavior and brain physiology, chemistry and structure. This proposals requests support to develop a computing infrastructure devoted to researchers in Brown's Carney Institute for Brain Science who investigate brain structure and function.",Brain Science Compute Cluster,9708078,S10OD025181,"['3-Dimensional', '5 year old', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Client', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'High Performance Computing', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Nature', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'novel', 'open source', 'petabyte', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'software systems']",OD,BROWN UNIVERSITY,S10,2019,300000,0.02392738204148998
"C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative ABSTRACT The BRAIN Initiative is designed to leverage sophisticated neuromodulation, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging techniques in human and non-human animal models in order to develop a multilevel understanding of human brain function. However, the necessary tools for organizing, processing and analyzing neuroimaging data generated through these efforts are not widely available as coherent and easy-to- use software packages. Gaps are particularly apparent for nonhuman data (i.e., monkey, rodent), as most of the existing processing and analytic software packages are specifically designed for human imaging. Methods have been proposed for addressing the challenges inherent to the processing of nonhuman data (e.g., brain extraction, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, brain parcellation, temporal denoising); to date, these have not been readily integrated into an easy-to-use, robust, and reproducible analysis package. Similarly, many of the sophisticated machine learning and modeling methods developed for neuroimaging analyses are inaccessible to most researchers because they have not been integrated into easy-to-use pipeline software. As a result, translational and comparative neuroimaging researchers patch together neuroinformatics pipelines that use various combinations of disparate software packages and in-house code. We propose to extend the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) open-source software to provide robust and reproducible pipelines for functional and structural MRI data. We will integrate the various disparate image processing and analysis methods used to handle the challenges of nonhuman imaging data, into a single, open source, configurable, easy-to-use end-to-end analysis pipeline package that is accessible locally or via the cloud. The end product will not only improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of nonhuman translational and comparative imaging, but also enable new avenues of scientific inquiry through our inclusion of methods that are yet to be applied to nonhuman imaging data (e.g., gradient- based cortical parcellation methods, hyperalignment). Specific aims of the proposed work include to: 1) Integrate neuroimaging processing and analysis methods optimized for BRAIN Initiative data, 2) Implement strategies for carrying out comparative studies of human and non-human populations, and 3) Extend C-PAC to include cutting-edge analytical strategies for identifying mechanisms of brain function. All development will occur “in the open” using GitHub and other collaborative tools to maximally involve participation in the C-PAC project. Annual hackathons will be held to collaborate with investigators from BRAIN Initiative awards and other neuroinformatics development projects to integrate their tools with C-PAC. Hands-on training will be held to train investigators on optimal use of the newly developed tools. NARRATIVE New neuroimaging analysis software is needed to process and analyze the various human and non-human neuroimaging data collected through the BRAIN Initiative.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders. Detailed analysis of structural relationships of both blood and lymphatic circulation in the brain system will have a direct impact on our general understanding of vascular function in brain/meningeal communication, and the cause and resolution of numerous diseases resulting from intracranial vascular disorders including impact of sex hormone (estrogen) deprivation, sleep deprivation, migraines, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dural arterio-venous fistulae, intradural hygroma and hematoma, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and intradural aneurysms that can lead to the development of neurological and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's. Quantitative description of blood and lymphatic vessel network structures using image analytics and machine learning algorithms distributed as software tools will have broad applications to quantification of other thin complex curvilinear anatomical structures (i.e. nerves, neuronal circuits, neurons, and neuroglia). The new software for blood and vessel network measurement will enable translation of fundamental pathophysiological knowledge gained from this proposal towards the development and assessment of the effectiveness of treatments and therapeutic interventions to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability associated with a range of neurological disorders.",Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system,9712424,R01NS110915,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animals', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Insomnia', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Lymphangioma', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Estrogens', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Health', 'Hematoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lymphatic', 'Lymphatic vessel', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meningeal', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subdural Hematoma', 'Subdural Hygroma', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vascular resistance', 'Venous', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'body system', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'geometric structure', 'in vivo', 'lymphatic circulation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microleakage', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal circuitry', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'response', 'sex', 'sleep pattern', 'solute', 'stem', 'submicron', 'tool', 'wasting']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2019,540520,-0.040090931070174064
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,9788528,R21MH118170,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Archives', 'Astrocytes', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Production', 'RNA', 'RNA Probes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'endophenotype', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual response', 'injured', 'injury and repair', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'machine learning algorithm', 'manufacturability', 'medical attention', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'microchip', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'nanomagnetic', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nucleic acid detection', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ratiometric', 'research clinical testing', 'response to injury', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,207338,0.02980949351469416
"Development of brain-computer interface methods to influence brain dynamics in stuttering Project summary Brain dynamics that drive variability within and between patients are an important, but poorly understood, element of many cognitive disorders. The long-term goal of this research project is to develop technology that will identify brain activity patterns associated with successful performance on a given task, and use this pattern as a target for brain-computer interface (BCI) training. The overarching hypothesis is that using BCI training to more often have a brain state that is spontaneously correlated to good performance will, in turn, improve overall performance. This approach could be developed into a powerful tool for rehabilitation and therapy for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here we will investigate persistent developmental stuttering (PDS) as a model to study brain dynamics associated with successful vs. unsuccessful performance. PDS is a speech disorder where fluent speech is punctuated to various degrees by stuttering. Individuals with PDS are otherwise neurologically in the normal range, which avoids complicating factors in most patient populations. Stuttering is intermittent; thus on some occasions the brain is in a state conducive to fluent speech and at other times it is not. We propose to use EEG activity shortly before speaking to predict whether somebody with PDS will stutter or speak fluently. Preliminary data are given to show proof of concept with traditional EEG analysis methods. This approach will be expanded by first using advanced methods such as common spatial pattern analysis and machine learning over multiple subject sessions to identify EEG signals that distinguish fluent vs. dysfluent trials (Aim 1). PDS subjects will then be trained to produce and maintain their EEG pattern that is most strongly associated with fluent speech by using BCI methods. We hypothesize that individuals will learn to modulate EEG features to be more consistent with fluent trials, which in turn will significantly reduce stuttering rate. After successful completion of this project we envision a new BCI-based intervention that can be used to encourage neural states conducive to fluent speech in those who stutter. The BCI intervention would complement traditional speech therapy using behavioral methods. The “two-step approach” of first identifying brain states associated with a patient’s best performance followed by BCI training to enter that state more often can be applied to rehabilitation in many other neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury, and mood disorders, to name a few. Project narrative The goal of this project is to develop brain-computer interface technology to optimize brain function on an individual basis. This could have therapeutic applications to many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and traumatic brain injury.",Development of brain-computer interface methods to influence brain dynamics in stuttering,9659309,R21DC016353,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Stuttering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Names', 'Neurologic', 'Normal Range', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stroke', 'Stuttering', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'improved', 'indexing', 'motor control', 'nervous system disorder', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R21,2019,170514,-0.05609517624024676
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9685036,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2019,50016,0.004301672343449328
"Measuring post-arrest neurologic injury via nanofluidic assay of brain-derived exosomal RNA Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) strikes over 300,000 people in the US annually. Between 30-50% of OHCA survivors experience some degree of long-term neurologic injury, from mild cognitive defects to severe disability. These injuries are the result of a complex set of ischemia-reperfusion phenomena, known as the post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS), that occurs over the first few days after resuscitation. Prognostication during this critical period, and prediction of neurologic disability, remains an enormous challenge. Serologic markers of brain injury, such as nerve-specific enolase or S100-B, have been tested extensively but have limited predictive value. Quantifying PCAS injury during clinical care has remained a key knowledge gap; with more accurate injury measurement, clinicians would be better able to tailor patient care appropriately by adjusting the intensity of brain-protective therapies including targeted temperature management. Our team has developed a novel approach to injury assessment that applies nanofluidic technology to isolate and analyze brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) from serum, small circulating bodies that represent their cells of origin and are released into the blood in greater quantity when cells are damaged or die. Exosomes carry a collection of microRNA (miRNA) species that can be measured and sequenced, allowing for precise analysis of a “transcriptome of brain injury”. When we coupled brain-derived exosomal miRNA analysis with machine learning techniques, we demonstrated that exosomal measurement predicted injury severity after traumatic brain injury. We now seek to apply this technology to post-arrest neurologic assessment; we hypothesize that serial EV sampling will allow for more precise measurement of PCAS-related brain injury. We will perform serial blood sampling of adult (age>17 y) non-traumatic resuscitated OHCA patients (0,6,12,24 h post-arrest) as well as from a negative control set of patients with myocardial infarction and positive control set of patients with significant cerebrovascular accident. We will characterize brain-derived miRNA species from both cohorts, first in a “derivation group” (n=10) and then a “validation group” (n=40) for each cohort. We will collect demographic and clinical outcome data, including neurologic status at discharge and at 90 d via modified Rankin Scale (mRS), dichotomized into “good” (mRS 0-2) or “poor” (mRS 3-6) outcome. A machine learning algorithm will be applied to the derivation group to develop an injury predictive tool, which will then be tested in the validation group. We hypothesize that (1) EV-derived miRNA will identify OHCA patients with brain injury at discharge compared to negative controls and (2) miRNA analysis will discriminate between OHCA patients with good or bad outcomes. Finally, we will apply the predictive tool across 4 timepoints in the OHCA cohort, hypothesizing that more injured patients will show a more significant injury miRNA pattern among earlier timepoints. If successful, this strategy could be coupled to post-arrest trials that require real-time neurologic injury evaluation, and could enable clinicians to tailor care to improve long-term neurologic outcomes. NARRATIVE Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest afflicts >300,000 people in the U.S. each year. Many resuscitated victims die before hospital discharge or suffer enduring neurologic disabilities from ischemia-reperfusion injury, yet our ability to quantitatively measure these injuries during critical care are limited. We propose to test a novel diagnostic approach to address this, using nanofluidic technology to isolate and characterize brain-derived microRNAs from a cohort of initial survivors of cardiac arrest, compared to a control cohort of patients with myocardial infarction (negative control) and a cohort of patients with stroke (positive control).",Measuring post-arrest neurologic injury via nanofluidic assay of brain-derived exosomal RNA,9824489,R21NS109763,"['Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'CD81 gene', 'Caliber', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'GLAST Protein', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurological status', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Value', 'Quality of life', 'RNA', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resuscitation', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Survivors', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'enolase', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microvesicles', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanofluidic', 'nanoscale', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'serological marker', 'species difference', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,442750,0.013865324647608125
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9741540,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,459850,0.016344071794873585
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9645112,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'source localization', 'surgery outcome']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2019,516327,0.02249813947802743
"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Integrating human connectomics and brain imaging genomics offers enormous potential, allowing us to perform systems biology approaches of the brain to better understand the interplay between genes, brain connectivity, and phenotypic outcomes (e.g., cognition, behavior, disorder). This proposal seeks to develop novel bioinformatics methods and software tools for integrative study of human connectomics and brain imaging genomics. These methods and tools can be applied to: (1) study normal brain functions to impact biomedical research in general, and (2) study brain disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics,9694688,R01EB022574,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'base', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic architecture', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning outcome', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phenotypic data', 'public health relevance', 'software systems', 'tool', 'tractography', 'trait', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,450954,0.05251883755190112
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9717282,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2019,670982,0.04823505876450915
"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) – herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),9795341,R24MH120037,"['Archives', 'Awareness', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'brain research', 'brain surgery', 'built environment', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data archive', 'data format', 'data mining', 'data structure', 'data submission', 'hackathon', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'repository', 'response', 'sensor', 'supercomputer', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web interface', 'web services', 'web site']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2019,926107,-0.023305314571114708
"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,9800892,R01MH120158,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'millisecond', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'preclinical study', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,716265,0.009063057618455023
"Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders Project Summary/Abstract Substance use costs society $740 billion dollars each year, placing an enormous burden on our nation’s health care and criminal justice systems. Approximately 85% of incarcerated offenders in the United States have a history of substance use and/or are imprisoned for crimes involving or motivated by alcohol and/or drug use. Incarcerated individuals tend to show poorer outcomes following substance use treatment, and forced abstinence via imprisonment is associated with risk for future substance use, which likely contributes to substance-related antisocial behavior following imprisonment. Over the past few decades, women have been sentenced to prison for drug-related reasons at alarming rates, with a growth rate exceeding that for men. Further, women offenders tend to be impacted more heavily by substance use with co-morbid psychopathology, placing greater demands on the system in terms of substance use and mental health treatments. Using the world’s largest forensic neuroimaging database on women offenders (SWANC-F), this proposal investigates substance use and related antisocial behavior following release from prison in a large sample of women offenders, with a focus on neurobiological mechanisms, to demonstrate the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women. Substance-related antisocial behavior, defined as committing crime(s) related to substance use after release from prison, will be obtained from re-arrest data in institutional files and comprehensive background checks on all women enrolled in the study. A random sample (n = 100) will then be followed-up with via phone to gather data on substance use and obtain supplemental information to corroborate re-arrest data from files and background checks. Employing regression analyses and machine learning/pattern classifier approaches, models will be compared testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic variables, along with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) brain measures, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes of interest in women. Specifically, this proposal seeks to test the extent to which psychiatric and socioeconomic factors confer risk for substance-related antisocial behavior following release from prison in women (Aim 1), and integrates and compares the utility of rsFC brain measures in improving these prediction models (Aim 2). Then, similar methods will be applied to test the prediction of substance use following release from prison (Aim 3). It is expected that psychiatric risk factors and socioeconomic protective factors, as well as rsFC brain measures, will be useful in predicting substance use and related antisocial behavior following incarceration, along with time elapsed between release from prison and initiation of substance use and related behavior. Testing factors that aid in predicting these behaviors in women has the potential to be far-reaching by informing the development of targeted treatments, including those that help to account for sex differences and co-morbid conditions related to substance use. Project Narrative Women represent one of the fastest growing segments of substance users in the United States, with a growth rate of substance-related offending exceeding that of men; however, women continue to be one of the most underserved populations in substance use research. This proposal will compare statistical models testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic factors, along with resting-state functional connectivity in and between cognitive control, decision-making, and reward-processing neural circuitry, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes in women. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women in an effort to help inform future treatment efforts.","Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders",9758947,F31DA047048,"['4-aminospiroperidol', 'Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fibrinogen', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prisons', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offender', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'psychopathic personality', 'reward processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2019,35547,0.02040089017558256
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,9606512,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,570175,0.0019978356952043536
"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9729856,R01NS095741,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Education', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Problem behavior', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'gray matter', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'segregation', 'stroke patient', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,570779,-0.06684635207429618
"Brain-wide quantitative mapping of microglia activation SUMMARY Recent technological developments such as tissue clearing and light sheet imaging have allowed for the three- dimensional visualization of the entire brain at cellular resolution. Translucence Biosystems has advanced this technology further by developing a) a proprietary Mesoscale Imaging System that allows visualization of an entire mouse brain much faster than prior techniques, b) machine learning-based algorithms that identify individual cells across the entire intact mouse brain and c) routines that rapidly determine cell densities in >1,200 brain regions defined by the annotated Allen Brain Atlas.  In the present proposal we will show the power of our technique by visualizing microglia density across the entire mouse brain as a biological marker for neuroinflammation. Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain. While they play important roles in healthy brain function, they also mediate neuroinflammatory processes that have a significant impact in multiple neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis as well as play possible roles in several neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, chemo brain). A tool for three-dimensional imaging of neuroinflammation patterns across the whole brain will help advance our understanding of neuroinflammatory processes in neurological diseases and aid in the evaluation of therapeutic approaches.  To visualize microglia, we will evaluate multiple strategies, including the CX3CR1-GFP mouse line, which expresses GFP in microglia, Iba1 immunolabeling and other antibody markers of activated microglia. The utility of our approach for monitoring neuroinflammation will be demonstrated in CX3CR1-GFP mice by treating them with the inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mice will be injected with three different LPS doses, and then microglia will be visualized and automatically counted across >1,200 brain regions. We will confirm the neuroinflammatory response to LPS by measuring protein markers of inflammation.  The applicability of our technique to neurodegenerative disease will be demonstrated by studying a mouse line used as a model of Alzheimer's disease that presents pronounced patterns of neuroinflammation. These experiments are designed to prove that our approach can provide reliable and detailed information describing neuroinflammation and that our results are better in terms of speed, resolution, and richness of information than any other technique available.  Once the goals for Phase I are met, we will be positioned to develop our microglia activation assay into a new gold standard for precise and complete histological detection of neuroinflammation. During phase II, we plan to 1) develop machine learning tools to establish morphological criteria that differentiate resting from activated microglia, 2) characterize microglial signatures in various mouse models of diseases with known or suspected neuroinflammation components, and 3) validate the microglial targeting of anti-inflammatory therapeutic candidates. NARRATIVE Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, protect against injury and infection. Microglia also play a critical role in dysfunctional neuroinflammatory processes that contribute to the development of brain diseases. We have developed novel methods to make mouse brains transparent so we can visualize and precisely count microglia throughout the intact mouse brain. In this proposal, we will test the feasibility of measuring brain-wide microglia activation using two disease models with a strong neuroinflammatory component, including a common transgenic mouse model that recapitulates the amyloid plaque accumulation that is a central feature of Alzheimer’s Disease.",Brain-wide quantitative mapping of microglia activation,9908302,R43MH122070,"['AIDS dementia', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Encephalitis', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Label', 'Light', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Senile Plaques', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'abeta deposition', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain cell', 'chemobrain', 'cytokine', 'density', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory marker', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'selective expression', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NIMH,"TRANSLUCENCE BIOSYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2019,449956,0.04284032003263723
"Neurocognitive deficits and compensation in binge drinkers ABSTRACT  Binge or heavy episodic drinking has been on the rise and is associated with a range of harmful consequences that scale up with the high intensity drinking prevalent among young adults. Evidence on the nature and extent of neural changes associated with binge drinking (BD) is scant, especially as regards sex differences, so more sensitive, high-precision imaging modalities are needed to examine persistent brain alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based methods are sensitive to brain function, as well as different neural tissue properties, and are well suited to provide multidimensional insight into the structure and organization of the brain. Despite a paucity of neuroimaging studies in BD, evidence obtained from individuals with alcohol use disorder suggests that degradation of prefrontal functions may contribute to impaired executive functions and an inability to refrain from hazardous drinking. Consistent with findings in alcohol use disorder, our data and other evidence indicate that BD participants show compensatory engagement of additional brain areas to maintain adequate performance on cognitively demanding tasks. Complementary MRI modalities can reveal the nature and regional specificity of structural degradation that underlies and constrains the compensatory reorganization.  The overall aim of this project is to use a range of MRI-based methods to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult binge drinking men and women. Because of their spatial precision and sensitivity to different neural tissue properties and functional features, MRI-based methods can provide insights into structural and functional alterations at the level of an interactive system. Specifically, BOLD fMRI will evaluate functional activation during tasks that probe cognitive control; resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis will examine alterations at the level of a functional network, while structural degradation will be reflected in gray and white matter morphometric features. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will characterize white matter microstructure and tract-based changes. These measures will be obtained from young adult men and women (18-30 yrs) who will be assigned to binge drinking (BD) and light drinking (LD) groups based on their drinking patterns and will be equated on age, race/ethnicity, and family history of alcoholism. Interactions between binge drinking and sex will be examined in all analyses. Overall, we hypothesize that neural alterations will correlate with a range of alcohol-related variables, with greater deficits and increased compensatory activity observed in BDs who engage in higher intensity drinking, with BD women being especially susceptible to functional deficits and structural degradation. Data will be integrated across imaging modalities in a machine learning classifier framework that will inform a predictive model of drinking trajectories based on 6-mos and 12-mos longitudinal follow-ups. Combined with a rich set of drinking indices, personality and behavioral variables, a constellation of brain measures will provide a mechanistic insight into the type and extend of the neural degradation underlying executive deficits and compensatory brain reorganization. NARRATIVE  The overall aim of this project is to use a multimodal MRI approach to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult men and women engaging in binge drinking.

"Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Abstract: The increasing availability of infant brain MR images, such as those that will be collected through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP, on which Dr. Shen is a Co-PI, focusing on data acquisition), affords unprecedented opportunities for precise charting of dynamic early brain developmental trajectories in understanding normative and aberrant growth. However, to fully benefit from these datasets, a major barrier that needs to be overcome is the critical lacking of computational tools for accurate processing and analysis of infant MRI data, which typically exhibit poor tissue contrast, large within tissue intensity variation, and regionally-heterogeneous and dynamic changes. To fill this critical gap, in 2012 we pioneered in creating an infant-centric MRI processing software package, called infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Tool (iBEAT), and a set of infant-specific atlases, called UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases, and further made them freely and publicly available via NITRC. Over the last 4 years, iBEAT and UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases have been downloaded 2900+ and 5600+ times, respectively, and contributed to 160+ independent research papers. As indicated by 30+ support letters, iBEAT is now driving the research for MRI studies of early brain development in many labs throughout the world. Results produced by iBEAT are also highlighted in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT, by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. To achieve this goal, we propose four aims. In Aim 1, we will create an innovative learning-based multi-source information integration framework for joint skull stripping and tissue segmentation for accurate structural measurements. Our method employs random forest to adaptively learn the optimal image appearance features from multimodality images and also informative context features from tissue probability maps. In Aim 2, we will construct longitudinal infant brain atlases at multiple time points (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age) for both T1-/T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR images. We propose a longitudinally-consistent sparse representation technique to construct representative atlases with significantly improved structural details by explicitly dealing with possible misalignments between images even after registration. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel learning-based approach for cortical topology correction and integrate it, along with our infant-centric analysis tools and atlases for cortical surfaces, into iBEAT for precise mapping of dynamic and complex cortical changes in infants. Unlike existing tools that perform poorly for infant brains, we will incorporate infant-dedicated tools for topology correction, surface reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and measurements. We will further integrate longitudinal infant cortical surface atlases equipped with parcellations based on growth trajectories. In Aim 4, we will significantly enhance iBEAT in terms of its software functionalities as well as user support via systematic outreach and training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC. Project Narrative This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. In particular, we propose four aims: 1) Learning-Based Brain Segmentation; 2) Infant Brain Atlases in the First Year of Life; 3) Cortical Surface-Based Analysis; and 4) Enhancing User Experience and Training.

"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them. Project narrative Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo treatments induce active neurobiological processes related to patients’ expectations, learned associations, perceived care and support, and hope for the future. Studying placebo treatments provides a window into these crucial context variables that will help understand vulnerability and resilience to mental health disorders and beyond.

"Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity Project Summary Prescription opioids, e.g., oxycodone (OXY), are commonly encountered in youth and pose a significant public health problem. In addition, there are significant individual differences in subjective responses to opioids which contribute to vulnerabilities for misuse. However, little is understood about OXY's effects on brain function, or on how individual differences in these effects might relate to variations in subjective responses. Assessment of OXY's effects on brain function is critical to understanding its abuse liability a n d will provide insight into how and why this drug leads to misuse and abuse/dependence in some, but not all, individuals. This proposal will assess the effects of low-dose OXY (10mg) on whole-brain functional connectivity (FC), and explore relationships with subjective responses in healthy young adults (ages 21 to 30 years, N=40) with limited prior opioid exposure. OXY's effects on FC during both reward- processing and resting-state will be assessed using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design incorporating multiband fMRI scanning. Subjective measures of drug response (e.g., `drug liking') will be collected before, during and after neuroimaging using NIDA PhenX measures. Neuroimaging data will be analyzed using data-driven methods to facilitate assessment of OXY's effects on FC both within hypothesized networks (e.g., salience and reward networks) as well as on patterns of between- network connectivity. Specifically, FC changes following OXY versus placebo (Aim 1) and relationships between these changes and subjective drug responses (Aim 2) will be assessed using intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD). ICD is a data-driven, voxel-to-voxel method of assessing whole-brain connectivity patterns that is not limited by specification of seed regions or connectivity thresholds. In addition, connectome-based machine-learning will be used to build a predictive model of subjective responses to OXY using data acquired during placebo scans (Aim 3). This project will for the first time assess the effects of a prescription opioid on whole-brain FC. Understanding OXY's effects on large-scale network dynamics is crucial for understanding its abuse liability, and will guide future studies of OXY in addicted and at-risk populations. Identification of networks that are predictive of subjective responses to OXY is an essential first step toward finding a reliable biomarker of opioid response that will help to identify individuals at highest risk for misuse. Project Narrative Prescription opioids are commonly encountered and, in a small proportion of individuals, may be a precursor to heroin initiation. This project will assess the effects of low-dose oxycodone (10mg) on brain function in healthy young adults (age 21 to 30 years). It will identify brain-based predictors of subjective opioid responses (`neural fingerprints') that can be used to inform prevention and intervention efforts.",Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity,9688964,R21DA045969,"['21 year old', 'Abstinence', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Cocaine', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Heroin', 'Heroin Users', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'Link', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Morphine', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurocognitive', 'Opioid', 'Oxycodone', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Spin Labels', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'executive function', 'financial incentive', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid misuse', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,251250,0.01666753645608454
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9692060,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2019,857083,0.0468302969197324
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9747247,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,682492,0.047801701280088114
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on the effects of adolescent marijuana use on working memory, inhibitory control and corticostriatal systems.",ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project,9691298,U01DA041028,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent marijuana use', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biologic Development', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'behavioral health', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'time use', 'translational research program', 'trend']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2019,990000,0.018055544514774025
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9731643,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'sociodemographics', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,631649,-0.0024960205926466456
"CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI Renewal CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Abstract Many studies have established strong relationships between cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), morphological and physiological brain changes, including stroke, and cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer disease and related disorders (ADRD). New physiological and functional MRI (fMRI) methods allow non- invasive measurement of regional cerebral blood flow, vascular reactivity and physiological brain connectivity. These techniques provide the means to evaluate the morphology, pathophysiology, and brain dysfunction related to CEVD and ADRD. The CARDIA Year 25 and Year 30 Brain MRI Substudies were designed to incorporate state-of-the-art MRI technology into the relatively younger population of CARDIA in order to determine MRI correlates of CVD risk factors and detect early CEVD. These studies documented early MRI changes of CEVD with strong correlations to CVD risk factors, particularly hypertension. The CARDIA Year 35 MRI Ancillary Study is intended to extend these earlier studies into the late middle age population of CARDIA. Most biomarkers of CEVD and ADRD are weakly expressed until approximately age 55, when they begin their precipitous rise to the steep slope evident in the 6th and 7th decades of life. Correspondingly, subclinical disease becomes clinically evident, reflected by increasing physiological changes and cognitive deficits. However, confounding the effects of CEVD are age, lifestyle, and co-morbidities, including ADRD. CARDIA, with its lengthy and rich historical data, is well-positioned to dissect the intricacies of CEVD and putative relationship to ADRD in the transition from middle age to seniority, starting at ages with few comorbidities and low medication use. Approximately 1044 participants will be enrolled in the Ancillary Study from the four participating Field Centers. MRI participants will be recruited from previous CARDIA Brain MRI participants and receive brain MRI scans and cognitive testing as defined for Y25 and Y30. Computer analysis of MRI data will be reported quantitatively by anatomic regions-of-interest. The primary objectives are to: 1) enhance statistical power to better document previously described and newly defined associations between demographic measures, risk factors and brain MRI findings, 2) define MRI parameters most strongly associated with clinical events and cognitive changes, and 3) identify early MRI biomarker patterns that inform disease pathophysiology and progression at an individual level. CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Project Narrative The CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI ancillary proposal will study the long-term associations between cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease risk factors, brain MRI findings, clinical events, and cognitive changes in young and mid adulthood as reflected in the CARDIA population. Early-onset and mid-life clinical events and cognitive changes in conjunction with a third brain MRI study and cognitive testing will allow us to define MRI pattern subtypes better reflecting pathophysiological variants reflective of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. The primary objectives are to: 1) enhance statistical power to better document previously described and newly defined associations between demographic measures, risk factors and brain MRI findings. 2) define MRI parameters most strongly associated with clinical events and cognitive changes reflective of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and 3) identify new, early MRI biomarker patterns that inform disease pathophysiology and progression at an individual level.",CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI Renewal,9891574,R01AG062819,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Ancillary Study', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Analysis', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'aging population', 'blood pressure regulation', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain volume', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'early onset', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'men', 'middle age', 'neuroimaging', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'sex', 'study population', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,1803300,0.014649557590221409
"Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network Project Summary: Skilled use of tools is a defining achievement of human cognition, and is enabled by the storage of tool-specific action memories. Many tools are associated with more than one action, and most everyday tasks are associated with more than one tool. Limb apraxia is a common, disabling, and puzzling left-hemisphere disorder characterized by prominent deficits in activating and selecting task-appropriate tool actions. Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms and brain regions enabling such selection in the neurologically intact brain, or how these processes go awry in apraxia. In several other cognitive domains, it has been suggested that appropriate response selection occurs via biased competition—that is, the prioritization of competing incoming information to enable appropriate response selection. Capitalizing on the promise of such frameworks, we have developed a new functional-neuroanatomic model of biased competition in a specific left hemisphere Tool Use network. Called “Two Action Systems Plus” (2AS+), the model generates testable hypotheses about the major principles determining tool action selection, and their deficiencies in apraxia. Specifically, we hypothesize that 1) Competition between tool actions is influenced by the graded similarity of tool action representations, as implemented primarily by the left posterior temporal cortex (pTC), 2) The outcome of the competitive process is affected by the strength and timing of activation of tool action representations, and depends on the dynamic interplay of left pTC and the parietal lobes, 3) Outcome is further influenced by a mechanism that biases competition towards the tool action that is appropriate to goals and context, as implemented by the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and its connections with the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and 4) There are two subtypes of apraxia characterized by distinct failures in the competitive selection process: an anterior subtype characterized by inability to appropriately resolve tool action competition, and a posterior subtype reflecting weakened competition. These hypotheses will be tested using a number of complementary methods with healthy and brain-lesioned participants, including voxel-based lesion symptom mapping, resting functional connectivity, fMRI with multi-voxel pattern analyses, and eyetracking. By specifying when and how visuomotor information plays a role in tool representations, the proposed experiments promise to critically constrain “embodied” cognition theories claiming that tools automatically evoke their actions. The proposed research will also advance the theoretical understanding of tool action by anchoring relevant constructs in a cognitive-neuroanatomic model, clarify how action representations are organized and activated, and improve our understanding of the mechanisms affecting errors and re-learning in apraxia, with implications for rehabilitation. Project Narrative: Apraxia, a disorder of tool use, is a common and substantially disabling consequence of left hemisphere stroke, yet is relatively rarely studied and hence poorly understood. The proposed work will clarify the brain regions that are associated with the disorder, the task factors that may improve tool use abilities, and the ability of the damaged Tool Use system to learn after stroke. This information will serve as an important building block in the development of treatment strategies.",Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network,9699553,R01NS099061,"['Achievement', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Apraxias', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cheese', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'novel', 'post stroke', 'response', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'visual motor']",NINDS,ALBERT EINSTEIN HEALTHCARE NETWORK,R01,2019,394895,-0.0017925637019444785
"Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity This proposal describes a rigorous and comprehensive plan designed to obtain expert training in advanced MRI acquisition and analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and fetal programming of health and disease risk. The proposed research relates to the public health problem of childhood obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. Obesity is a multi-factorial phenotype. Among these factors, the critical importance of energy homeostasis (balance), and the hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates it, is well established. However, it is unclear whether the observed difference in this brain circuitry between obese and normal-weight individuals is a cause or consequence of the obese state. Also, relatively little is known about the developmental origin (fetal and early postnatal) of variation in this brain circuitry and its prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. My proposal addresses this fundamental knowledge gap. I advance the overarching hypothesis that energy homeostasis brain circuitry a) already is established by the time of birth; b) exhibits developmental plasticity (fetal programming); and c) is functionally relevant (predicts postnatal adipose tissue accrual). The K99 mentored phase will be conducted under the mentorship of leading experts in fetal programming of health and disease (P. Wadhwa), brain imaging (P. Thompson), and developmental systems neuroscience (D. Fair). I will first develop novel MRI-based measures of the newborn brain circuitry underlying energy homeostasis, and then identify the prenatal determinants of variation in this circuitry. The importance of focusing efforts on the newborn brain derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time is not yet influenced by postnatal factors. In the R00 phase, I will recruit a new cohort and use a repeated measures design to address the functional relevance of the initial (newborn) setting of this brain circuitry in the context of adipose tissue accrual over infancy (a key indicator of childhood obesity risk). K99/Aim 1. Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry, this aim will fulfill an important and as yet unmet need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also technical capability. K99/Aim 2. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology) determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are associated with infant adiposity. R00/Aim 3. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity risk. R00/Aim 4. Consider the complimentary hypothesis that infant adiposity at birth is prospectively associated with changes in newborn energy homeostasis brain circuitry. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan for the applicant, Dr. Jerod Rasmussen, to obtain expert training and conduct research that aims to identify novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, identify their gestational biology determinants, and determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood obesity. The identification of brain-related biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity,9871505,K99HD100593,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemical Shift Imaging', 'Cholesterol', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'data reduction', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'energy balance', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'metabolic rate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'population based', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'sex', 'skills', 'vector', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K99,2019,108276,0.0601567726299961
"Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging Project Summary. Neuroimaging is poised to take a substantial leap forward in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of human behavior, due to a combination of improved analytic techniques and the quality of imaging data. These advances are allowing researchers to develop population-level multivariate models of the functional brain representations underlying behavior, performance, clinical status and prognosis, and other outcomes. Population-based models can identify patterns of brain activity, or `signatures', that can predict behavior and decode mental states in new individuals, producing generalizable knowledge and highly reproducible maps. These signatures can capture behavior with large effect sizes, and can be used and tested across research groups. However, the potential of such signatures is limited by neuroanatomical constraints, in particular individual variation in functional brain anatomy. To circumvent this problem, current models are either applied only to individual participants, severely limiting generalizability, or force participants' data into anatomical reference spaces (atlases) that do not respect individual functional topology and boundaries. Here we seek to overcome this shortcoming by developing new topological models for inter-subject alignment, which register participants' functional brain maps to one another. This will increase effective spatial resolution, and more importantly allow us to explicitly analyze the spatial topology of functional maps make inferences on differences in activation location and shape across persons and psychological states. We will test and validate the methods using a purpose-designed experiment (n = 120) that includes two types of naturalistic narrative experiences (movies and audio stories) and tasks from three functional domains (pain, emotion, and cognition). The tasks are designed with several constraints in mind, including: (1) systematic coverage of cognitive, emotional, and sensory tasks matched in stimulus properties (e.g., stimulus duration); and (2) multiple levels of task demand within each task, to permit parametric modeling and prediction of demand levels. We will compare our new methods to existing methods based on out-of-sample effect sizes in predicting behavior and test-retest reliability. We will make the analytic methods, software, and dataset available to other researchers, along with a library of functional reference spaces for multiple psychological states. Project Narrative. We develop new methods for enhancing the development of models that can predict behavior, clinical status, and other outcomes using neuroimaging data. Successful development will help improve the translational impact of neuroimaging. It will also contribute to developing multidisciplinary neuroscience, by promoting the development of neural signatures for specific mental processes in humans with increased precision and specificity.",Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging,9747296,R01EB026549,"['Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Charon', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gaussian model', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Processes', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Wages', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'mental state', 'model development', 'movie', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'statistics', 'translational impact']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,692050,0.019798457228031363
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9774005,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,702420,0.011118310085147326
"Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity This revised application, submitted in response to NIH PA-18-741 “Secondary Analyses in Obesity,  Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,” relates to the public health problem of childhood  obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, determinants and role of energy balance  homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. The proposal describes a comprehensive  plan designed to advance neonatal MRI analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and  fetal programming of health and disease risk. The critical importance of the  hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates energy homeostasis is well  established, and MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuits have been  associated with obesity outcomes. However, it is unclear whether the observed differences in these  brain regions and circuitry in obese relative to normal-weight individuals are a cause,  consequence, or both, of the obese state. Moreover, relatively little is known about the  developmental ontogeny of these brain regions and circuitry, particularly during the fetal period,  and their prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. This project addresses  this fundamental knowledge gap. We will develop novel measures and conduct analyses using newborn  brain imaging and other data elements from 4 inter-linked NIH-funded projects on prenatal stress  and fetal programming of brain development and infant body composition (R01 HD-060628; R01  MH-091351; R01 HD-065825; UG3 OD-023349). The importance of selecting the newborn brain as the  starting time point derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time could not yet have  been influenced by postnatal factors such as diet/feeding, thereby enabling the study to  disentangle the temporality of effects. In a recent position paper on the pathogenesis of obesity,  the U.S. Endocrine Society emphasized the need to conceptualize obesity as a disorder of the  energy homeostasis system and elucidate its underlying mechanisms and developmental influences.  Towards this objective, and using a population of ~100 mother-infant dyads followed from early  gestation through birth till 5 yrs age, we will integrate research aims that leverage the resources  of these projects to advance our understanding of the origins of childhood obesity. Aim 1.  Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional  MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry,  this aim will fulfill an important need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also  technical capability. Aim 2. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these  novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human  newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity  and subsequent childhood obesity risk. Aim 3. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology)  determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are  associated with infant adiposity. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of  energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately  provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of  childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan to conduct research that aims to identify  novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn,  determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood  obesity, and identify their gestational biology determinants. The identification of brain-related  biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment  will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early  identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity,9824927,R21DK118578,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Body Composition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Endocrine', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'clinically significant', 'connectome', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'energy balance', 'feeding', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'follow-up', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'inter-individual variation', 'interest', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'vector', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R21,2019,192353,0.05656164304403506
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior. We employ a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate this interaction during a variety of cognitive tasks.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,9625164,R01MH071589,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Paper', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual attention', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive task', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'motivated behavior', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'reward processing', 'theories']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,383798,0.011888150498367842
"RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data Project Summary/Abstract  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allows the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded. We use the term ECOG to refer to the entire range of invasive recording techniques (from subdural strips and grids to penetrating electrodes) that share the common attribute of recording neural activity from the human brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. While this ability has resulted in many high-impact advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain function in health and disease, it generates staggering amounts of data as a single patient can be implanted with hundreds of electrodes, each sampled thousands of times a second for hours or even days. The difficulty of exploring these vast datasets is the rate-limiting step in using them to improve human health. We propose to overcome this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the unique properties of ECOG. We dub this software tool RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).  The first goal of Aim 1 is to release RAVE 1.0 to the entire ECOG community by month 6 of the first funding period. This will maximize transformative impact by putting the new tools in the hands of users as quickly as possible, facilitating rapid adoption. The design philosophy of RAVE is driven by three imperatives. The first is to keep users ""close to the data"" so that users may make discoveries about the brain without being misled by artifacts. The second imperative is rigorous statistical methodology. The final imperative is ""play well with others"". As described in Aim 2, our approach will make it easy to seamlessly incorporate new and existing analysis tools written in Matlab, C++, Python or R into RAVE, giving users the best of both worlds: advanced but easy-to-use visualization of results from ECOG experiments, whether they are analyzed with the off-the- shelf tools routines provided with RAVE or novel tools developed by others. Project Narrative  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allow the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded with high spatial and temporal resolution.

"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three‐dimensional (3D) whole‐brain imaging of non‐transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole‐brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo‐bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide‐spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state‐of‐the‐art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large‐scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,9677046,R44MH116827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2019,699967,0.03588234783651527
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. We will also disseminate our approaches through software tools and interactive web-based visualization of available data. 37",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,9776502,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Tars', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data reduction', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'web portal', 'white matter']",NIBIB,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,400000,0.03228437392936248
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse.

"Developing new tools for high throughput analysis of microcircuits and synapse ultrastructure using tagged vesicular transporters and deep learning. PROJECT SUMMARY Synaptic dysfunction is a common feature of neuropsychiatric disease. For example, a hallmark of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s is synaptic fibrilization and aggregation of key proteins that participate in synapse and cell loss. Maladaptive plastic changes in synapse structure and function underlie key aspects of behavioral and mood disorders ranging from addiction to depression, as well as neurodevelopmental diseases like schizophrenia and autism. It is for these reasons that many investigators across a range of neuroscience disciplines study the synapse, and the reason that new tools to study synapse structure and function within neural circuits of interest are sorely needed. Indeed, current tools to assess synapse structure in defined cell types are not readily compatible with state-of-the-art 3D volume approaches such as serial block face scanning electron microscopy, and are severely hampered by inadequate computational tools for quantitative assessment of these massive datasets. However, advances in molecular genetics, optics, engineering and computing provide new opportunities to develop information rich strategies to peer into the synapse. Here, we combine such advances to achieve a new state-of-the-art in imaging and analyzing microcircuit connectivity and synapse structure within neurotransmitter-defined neural networks. Specifically, we leverage the fact that the bulk of signaling across the synapse is mediated by a relatively small population of small molecule neurotransmitters that are synthesized and packaged into synaptic vesicles at the site of release in axonal compartments. The bulk of neurotransmission is thus dependent on just seven well- described vesicular transporters expressed in brain. Our overall goal is to build a rigorous, easily deployable, cell-type-specific, expandable, multi-functional toolkit for imaging and quantifying neurotransmitter-defined synaptic connections by both light and electron microscopy in mice. To accomplish this, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 to insert electron microscopy-compatible tags into native vesicular transporters (Aim 1), establish simplified procedures for their monochrome and ‘multicolor’ labeling in 3D ultrastructure (Aim 2), and computational tools for automated segmentation and quantitative analysis of key pre- and post-synaptic metrics (Aim 3). Though these Aims are independently meritorious, by synthesizing them we aim to generate a complete toolkit that will allow investigators to render neurotransmitter-defined circuit connections into 3D ultrastructure datasets with automated quantitative assessment of key features of pre- and post-synaptic structure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Synaptic and structural dysfunction are causally related to both the causes and symptoms of neuropsychiatric illness ranging from Alzheimer’s disease to addiction and depression. Modern advances in molecular genetics, engineering, materials, and computer sciences have created new opportunities to understand how brain dysfunction gives rise to disease. Here, we leverage these interdisciplinary advances to develop new probes, new methods, and new analysis pipelines to study the normal and pathological structure and function of synaptically coupled brain cells.",Developing new tools for high throughput analysis of microcircuits and synapse ultrastructure using tagged vesicular transporters and deep learning.,9822844,RF1MH120685,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acetylcholine', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Axon', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Chelating Agents', 'Chemicals', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Deposition', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electron energy loss spectroscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunoelectron Microscopy', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Lanthanoid Series Elements', 'Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mood Disorders', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Optics', 'Oxides', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Purines', 'Recycling', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'Vesicle', 'Viral', 'Viral Vector', 'Western Blotting', 'addiction', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain dysfunction', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'high throughput analysis', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'light microscopy', 'materials science', 'monoamine', 'nanoscale', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neurotransmission', 'peer', 'polymerization', 'postsynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'small molecule', 'synaptic function', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",RF1,2019,2509965,-0.006805688312865836
"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing disability and limiting the costs to society at large.",Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence,9682508,R01MH113550,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Wolves', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'prisma', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'software development', 'statistics', 'theories']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,736103,0.04043220787042128
"Axonal connectomics: dense mapping of projection patterns between cortical areas Project Summary/Abstract Connectomics is a new field, created with the goal of densely or completely mapping the connections in the brain. Because this goal is at present only achievable for small organisms, connectomics has taken on two forms in the study of larger brains. Macroscale connectomics is used to describe the connections between brain areas, which in experimental animals is achieved with tracers, while humans it is typically pursued at a very coarse scale with diffusion imaging, a form of MRI. Microscale connectomics aims to create dense wiring diagrams of local circuits, small volumes of the brain with neurons that form rich networks within a local neighborhood. Macroscale connectomics lacks cellular resolution, while microscale connectomics can only reconstruct small volumes, with little information about the source of inputs entering the volume, or the targets of axons exiting it. We propose to develop a technique to bridge the gap between the microscale and the macroscale by creating experimental and analytical methods for mapping individual axons over long distances, concentrating on the largest 50% of myelinated axons (long-distance “wires”) in the brain. For the current RFA to develop “Tools to Facilitate High-Throughput Microconnectivity Analysis” we are specifically targeting one of the recommended goals, to “Develop a high-quality toolbox of methods for efficiently mapping and annotating projections” in the human brain. The method—based on high-resolution 3D imaging of antibody-stained axons—can be scaled to analyze entire brains, but here we propose to apply it to the posterior pole of a macaque brain, a large (~10 cm3) volume will contain >20 visual cortical areas. The goal is to trace most of the larger axons (>1 um) between these areas, thus creating a dense axonal connectomics data set from the cortical visual system, allowing us to examine not only the hierarchy of visual areas, but also the structure of computational maps. Ultimately, this approach will permit whole-brain analysis of axonal projections, with targeted examination of key circuits for microscale connectomics. While microscale connectomics of whole human brains will remain impossible for the foreseeable future, dense axonal mapping should be achievable in the next 5 to 10 years. This proposal offers a pathway towards this new type brain-wide anatomy: Axonal Connectomics. Project Narrative/Relevance This proposal will contribute to the fundamental question of how the brain is wired, in particular the pathways by which individual neurons communicate over long distances between different parts of the brain. One of the most promising treatments for a variety of brain disease—deep brain stimulation—is thought to work largely by activating these long distance “wires”, so a thorough understanding of their trajectories might have considerable long-term clinical importance.",Axonal connectomics: dense mapping of projection patterns between cortical areas,9822860,RF1MH117820,"['3-Dimensional', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automation', 'Axon', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Caliber', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Diffusion', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Judgment', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Occipital lobe', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Primates', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain volume', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'gray matter', 'imaging approach', 'light microscopy', 'neurofilament protein H', 'nonhuman primate', 'petabyte', 'physical mapping', 'programs', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'vector', 'white matter']",NIMH,ALLEN INSTITUTE,RF1,2019,2312287,0.03324949571789206
"Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method of focally stimulating the brain that uses electromagnetic induction and does not require surgery. There is optimism that TMS will revolutionize how we treat neurological and psychiatric disorders, evidenced by over 1000 clinical trials registered using TMS. Much of this optimism stems from the successful use of TMS as a treatment for depression. Despite the large number of clinical trials using TMS the number of therapeutic indications has been stagnant, limited to major depression and more recently obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are fundamental questions about the underlying mechanisms of action for TMS that will be critical to understand in order to advance this treatment modality. Here, we propose a unique collaborative project between neurology and neurosurgery that will allow an unprecedented window into understanding how TMS impacts the human brain. Specifically, we will perform TMS in neurosurgical patients with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) monitoring to record real time effects of TMS on local and remote brain areas with an unparalleled combination of spatial and temporal resolution relative to other human studies. We have already demonstrated the safety of this approach using a gel-based phantom brain and have results from seven patients demonstrating safety and preliminary results. For the current proposal we aim to: 1) characterize the response of TMS on the human brain as recorded from iEEG between active and sham conditions, and 2) relate remote electrophysiological responses induced by TMS to measures of brain connectivity between the stimulation and recording sites assessed with resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI). This will allow us to evaluate the relationship between TMS-evoked iEEG responses and the strength of functional connectivity to the stimulation site in a regression model. We hypothesize that: 1) TMS will have focal effects detected from surface electrodes underlying the stimulation site as well as network-level engagement detected at remote sites, 2) Repetitive TMS will induce frequency- specific effects that differ between 0.5 and 10 Hz stimulation protocols, and 3) the magnitude of repetitive TMS-evoked iEEG responses across electrodes will relate to the strength of rs-fcMRI between the stimulation and recording sites. By investigating the electrophysiological responses of TMS with high spatiotemporal precision in humans, this study will provide new mechanistic insights into the effects of TMS on target engagement and relate these findings to imaging methods already in widespread use. Moreover, the TMS will be applied in a clinically meaningful way by targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a protocol used to treat depression. Generating results for these aims will be key to advancing our understanding of how TMS engages brain networks, which can be leveraged to rationally develop personalized, imaging-guided therapeutic TMS for depression and other disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will help our understanding of how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) affects the brain. We will develop a new method of measuring TMS-induced changes in brain activity with high spatial and temporal accuracy that is only possible with intracranial recording. The research will shed light on the mechanism of TMS and facilitate the development of better interventions and treatments for psychiatric diseases.",Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans,9805657,R21MH120441,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurology', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cranium', 'field study', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optimism', 'programs', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'stem', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2019,231750,-0.002665046010400165
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Longitudinal Analysis of the Dynamic Network Disruptions in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract A plethora of neuroscience studies has found that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can be understood as a dysfunction syndrome where the structural and functional connectivity of the large-scale network are progressively disrupted by molecular pathomechanism that is not fully understood. The disruptions to the network exhibit dynamic patterns at different stages of AD, which holds valuable clues to understand AD progression. Current network computational tools are designed for cross-sectional data only, which is insufficient to maintain temporal consistency in investigating longitudinal network changes. To address this problem, we will develop the first extensive computational tool for longitudinal network analysis. Specifically, we will propose a learning-based approach to precisely quantify the evolution of brain network from noisy imaging data (Aim 1). Sparse representation and tensor analysis technique will be integrated to seek for the consistent longitudinal brain networks. We will apply our longitudinal network analysis tool to the series diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from ADNI database to investigate how Alzheimer’s disease attacks human brain network by inspecting the dynamic interactions between the hub and non-hub nodes in AD progression (Aim 2). The outcome of this project will be the first longitudinal brain network analysis tool in computational neuroscience and neuroimaging fields. We will release the software (both binary program and source code), to facilitate the network studies in other neuro diseases that show brain network dysfunction. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a set of efficient computational tools specifically for longitudinal brain network analysis. In order to accurately measure the connectivity strength, we propose a learning-based approach to find the intrinsic brain network from the noisy imaging data. Sparse representation and tensor analysis technique have been integrated into brain network optimization for preserving the longitudinal consistency. It is worth noting that our data-driven approach is free of the ad-hoc thresholding technique which may undermine the repeatability of discovery. To the best of our knowledge, our learning-based approach is the first extensive computational tool for longitudinal network analysis in neuroscience and neuroimaging field. We will apply our longitudinal network analysis tools to the series diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from ADNI database to investigate how Alzheimer’s disease attacks human brain network by inspecting the dynamic interactions between hub and non-hub nodes in AD progression.

"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia. Computational modeling will aim at developing risk and resilience predictors, essential for early identification and intervention during a dynamic period of brain maturation.",Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers,9838618,R01MH119219,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Functioning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'childhood adversity', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'data anonymization', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'emerging adult', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'sex', 'social']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,795608,0.038987429266018885
"Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis Project Summary: Brain networks linking the cortex to thalamus are critical for cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning. Dysruption of thalamocortical networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychosis, and mechanisms of clinical phenotypes, especially cognitive impairment. This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks. The availability of several large-scale cross-sectional datasets containing multi-modal neuroimaging data and extensive phenotypic data on healthy and at-risk individuals has created an unprecedented opportunity to address these critical knowledge gaps. They include the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN: n=656, ages 18-88); Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI- RS: n=932, ages 6-85); Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset (PING: N=1239, ages 3-20); Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC: n=1601, ages 8-21), which includes psychosis spectrum (PS) youth; and the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS: n=397). Building on our prior work in clinical populations and leveraging the considerable resources of these datasets, we propose to chart the development of thalamocortical networks in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and youth with PS symptoms (Aim 2), characterize the associations between thalamocortical biomarkers and cognition (Aim 3), and investigate the clinical utility of thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers at identifying atypical brain development in individual subjects across the psychosis continuum and predicting conversion to psychosis in clinical high risk individuals (Aim 4). The proposed Aims will: 1) establish critical normative lifespan development data for refining and testing etiological models of not just psychosis, but other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as aging- related disorders; 2) inform the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders and contribute to dimensional models of psychosis; 3) help define the neural basis of executive cognitive abilities thereby providing the necessary foundation for mechanistic models of normal cognitive function and cognitive impairment in psychosis; and 4) potentially provide risk biomarkers and intervention targets for youth at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Public Health Relevance: Many psychiatric disorders emerge between childhood and early adulthood, a period when the brain is undergoing significant developmental changes, and are associated with cognitive impairment which leads to lifelong limitations in psychosocial functioning. Determining how and when premorbid brain development goes awry, clarifying the neural basis of cognitive impairment, and establishing the clinical utility of brain-based biomarkers at predicting illness onset in individuals at high risk for neuropsychiatric illness are essential to developing targeted interventions that prevent the onset of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.",Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis,9710707,R01MH115000,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'symptomatology', 'young adult']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,369864,-0.00956132461036998
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9725782,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biologic Development', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,446742,0.03097195286334777
"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology. Early interventions crafted using these growth charts would benefit the public health by reducing the huge disability associated with psychiatric disorders and limiting the costs to society at large.",Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry,9810689,R01MH120482,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Age', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Early Intervention', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'externalizing behavior', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'portability', 'quality assurance', 'response', 'segregation', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'somatosensory', 'synergism', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,780855,0.05395845067423354

To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems.

"Developmental Variations in Corticostriatal Thalamocortical Circuits and their Relationship to Psychopathology ABSTRACT Detailed characterizations of brain development are essential to understanding factors underlying the emergence of psychopathology and its progression. Corticostriatal thalamocortical (CSTC) circuits are central to current models of both externalizing and internalizing psychopathologies. However, our understanding of their development and the impact of pathologic processes on these circuits is primarily limited to regional structural properties and specific disorders (e.g., Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). As such, there is a need for a more comprehensive examination of CSTC circuit development and its relations to psychopathology. The overarching goals of the proposed work are to characterize the development of CSTC circuits using structural MRI and resting state functional MRI, and to link variations in their trajectories to the emergence of psychopathology. We will model developmental trajectories of structural morphology and functional interactions within seven CSTC networks defined based on their connectivity with large-scale cortical networks and relate deviations to externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Consistent with recent calls for secondary analysis of existing datasets to accelerate the identification of brain-behavior relationships that may serve as modifiable clinical targets, the proposed work will make use of openly shared pediatric imaging datasets (ages: 5.0-24.0; high resolution T1 anatomical and resting state functional scans for each participant). Specifically, we will generate a large-scale aggregate cross-sectional sample (n = 3918) for the purposes of delineating trajectories for the seven CSTC networks. We train age-prediction models for each of the networks and pool their predictions to generate multivariate CSTC maturity profiles for each individual. These profiles will be used to subtype individuals into neurobiologically homogenous subgroups, which are expected to differ with respect to dimensional measures of psychopathology calculated using the bifactor model framework (i.e. general psychopathology [p-factor], internalizing, externalizing). An aggregate longitudinal sample (n = 250; 3 time- points per participant, each 12-15 months apart) will be generated to evaluate the ability of changes in CSTC maturity profiles over time to predict longitudinal changes in psychopathology. Specific aims of the proposed work are to: 1) Estimate the developmental trajectories of seven CSTC networks; 2) Determine associations between CSTC network maturity profile subtypes and dimensions of psychopathology; and 3) Evaluate predictive relationships between longitudinal changes in maturity profiles and those in dimensions of psychopathology. Given the scale of the datasets employed, cloud-based computing, and optimized analytic frameworks will be leveraged to ensure the feasibility of achieving the proposed work within the project period. All codes developed will be openly shared.

"Statistical Methods for Multilevel Multivariate Functional Studies Abstract  While imaging studies are widely used in clinical practice and research, the number of neuroimaging- based biomarkers is small. For example, in clinical trials of immunomodulatory therapies for MS, the only commonly used imaging biomarkers are the total lesion volume and the number of new and en- hancing lesions. These biomarkers are essential, but do not capture the recovery process of lesions, which is thought to decline in more severe, progressive disease. The partial or complete recovery of lesions may depend both on the ability of the brain to heal and on external factors, such as treat- ment or environmental and behavioral exposures. In this proposal we take the natural next step of proposing imaging biomarkers for MS based on the formation and change of lesions as observed on multi-sequence structural MRIs. To solve this problem we propose to address several general method- ological problems: 1) develop models and methods for the longitudinal analysis of several images of the same brain; 2) identify and estimate the length of history that is necessary to estimate recovery; 3) study the association with known biomarkers of the disease (in this case total volume and number of new and enhancing lesions); 4) develop methods that are robust to changes in imaging protocols that inevitably arise in longitudinal neuroimaging studies; and 5) develop the computational tools that allow for sophisticated methods to be implemented seamlessly in practice. While our scientiﬁc problem is focused, the proposed statistical methods are general and can be applied to a wide variety of longitu- dinal neuroimaging studies. For example, there are many ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging studies, including the ADNI, AIBL, HBC, and MISTIE, where our methods could be used to study subtle or large changes in lesions or in white and gray matter intensities. Project narrative. The project provides statistical analysis methods for quantiﬁcation of the evolution in the intensity of brain lesions on multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

"A data science toolbox for analysis of Human Connectome Project diffusion MRI Project Summary/Abstract The connections between different brain regions play an important role in normal brain function. This project proposes to create an end-to-end pipeline for analysis of human white matter connections using “tractometry” methods. In tractometry, tissue properties are estimated in the long-range connections between remote brain regions. The project will focus on the analysis of the Human Connectome Project diffusion MRI dataset, which provides one of the largest available publicly available datasets of diffusion MRI from a sample of normal healthy individuals. Based on this dataset, we propose to create a normative distribution of tissue properties in the major white matter connections, to develop novel statistical methods to connect the properties of white matter connections to cognitive abilities, and to create visualization tools for further communication and exploration of the data. The tools created will be initially applied to the Human Connectome Project Dataset, but will also be useful in smaller studies on speciﬁc populations and in other large-scale datasets, such as the ABCD study.

Specifically, TR&D1 (Data Science) focuses on methodological developments for the management and informatics of brain and related data. This project will develop and issue new methods for robust scientific data management to create an environment where scientific analyses can be reproduced and/or enhanced, data can be easily discovered and reused, and analysis results can be visualized and made publicly searchable. TR&D2 (Diffusion MRI and Connectomics) seeks to advance the study of brain connectivity using diffusion imaging and its powerful extensions. This project will go beyond traditional tensor models of diffusion for assessing tissue and fiber microstructure and connectivity, develop tract-based statistical analysis tools using Deep Learning, introduce novel adaptive connectivity mapping approaches, using L1 fusion of multiple tractography methods, and provide mechanisms to study connectivity and diffusion imaging over 10,000 subjects. (This technology and these methods will be managed and executed by the TR&D1 framework to distributed datasets totaling over 10,000 subjects). Lastly, our TR&D3 (Intrinsic Surface Mapping) develops a general framework for surface mapping in the high dimensional Laplace-Beltrami embedding space via the mathematical optimization of their Riemannian metric. Our approach here overcomes fundamental limitations in existing methods based on spherical registration by eliminating the metric distortion during the parameterization step, thus achieving much improved accuracy in mapping brain anatomy. Coupled with a mature and efficient administrative structure and comprehensive training and dissemination, this program serves a wide and important need in the scientific community.

"Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This lack of progress is reflected in the continued excessive direct and indirect health care expenditure related to these conditions, largely in form of unnecessary diagnostic procedures to rule out ""organic"" disease and lack of novel, cost effective therapies. During the past funding cycle, we have identified functional alterations of brain networks in IBS patients, both in the resting state and in response to physical and psychological stimuli, which are related to sex, gene polymorphisms and a history of early adverse life events. These functional findings were accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of both white and grey matter in the brain of IBS patients resulting in a distinct ""brai signature"". In this revised competitive renewal application, I plan to take these insights to the next level by validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IB patients from healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome. Using an array of advanced, innovative brain imaging, genomic and microbiological techniques, I will address these goals in 3 Specific Aims: A. Identify disease- specific brain signatures of IBS, identify correlations of these signatures with behavioral and clinical parameters, and determine accuracy to predict IBS phenotype compared to HCs, and patients with chronic gut inflammation (ulcerative colitis). B. Identify gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and correlate with distinct brain signatures in IBS patients as identified in Aim A. C. Identify gut microbiome derived metabolites which correlate with brain signatures in IBS patients. The longitudinal design of the study combined with a mediator/moderator analysis approach will enable us to infer causality between brain, peripheral factors and symptoms, and will provide the basis for future mechanistic studies in animal models. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to improve our understanding of the complex bidirectional brain gut interactions of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS and identify biomarkers in order to develop more effective treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 15% of the U.S. population and leads to a substantial economic and societal burden. Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for IBS. This proposal is relevant to public health in that it is aimed at validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IBS patients fro healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome to provide the basis for mechanistic studies, advance our knowledge of IBS pathophysiology and aid future development of IBS therapies.",Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation,9773019,R01DK048351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feces', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Metadata', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visceral', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disorder control', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'monocyte', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'pain sensitivity', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,461813,0.01269887914085979
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology). The findings will yield novel classification approaches for negative symptom severity, may identify novel treatment targets (circuitry), and may yield classifications to stratify patients to treatment conditions.",ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits,9851722,R01MH121246,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Aphasia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Face', 'Factor Analysis', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Informatics', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychopathology', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Social Processes', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'computational platform', 'dimensional analysis', 'disability', 'druggable target', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient stratification', 'pleasure', 'quality assurance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'social', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'working group']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,1010160,0.004232677838937187
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9747293,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multi-task learning', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'premature neonates', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,452012,-0.010297632989593413

"Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation Project Summary  We are in critical need of targeted and individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affect nearly 50% of Americans during our lifetimes. Brain stimulation treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), represent the front-line of innovative approaches to correct dysfunctional brain networks for patients suffering from mental illness. rTMS is FDA-approved for depression and obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) with clinical trials underway for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use, among others. However, as currently administered, rTMS lacks a biomarker to individually optimize treatment and thus suffers from a poor clinical response rate (<50%). Without personalization of rTMS, we risk a one-size-fits-all treatment for all psychiatric disorders, not dissimilar to how antidepressants are administered.  Using simultaneous TMS and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), I identified a depression severity biomarker from a double-blind randomized clinical trial treating depressed patients with one month of active or placebo rTMS. The degree of this biomarker change significantly predicted clinical improvement after rTMS treatment. Direct brain recordings further suggest that a single stimulation session is sufficient to modulate this biomarker, indicating that this brain-based biomarker can be monitored daily to support empiric treatment optimization.  With this in mind, I propose to develop the first broadly generalizable platform for real-time biomarker monitoring (Aim #1) and personalized rTMS treatment (Aims #2 & 3). I will enroll 54 depressed patients to participate in a cross-over, placebo-controlled study directly comparing personalized, adaptive rTMS to standard rTMS. Primary outcome will be target engagement and dose-response of the depression severity biomarker. Successful implementation of this work includes the early stratification of treatment responders and personalized and more effective treatments for non-responders. This approach is broadly applicable to other depression biomarkers, all psychiatric populations treated with rTMS, and other brain stimulation modalities. More generally, my goals are to establish the fundamental principles of human brain plasticity and to construct platforms for rapid biomarker development, engagement, and integration into personalized brain stimulation treatments. Project Narrative We need targeted, individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affects nearly 50% of Americans. Brain stimulation treatments target dysfunctional brain networks with minimal side effects but are currently applied in a one-size-fits-all manner, thus limiting its efficacy.

One of the major hurdles in processing modern neuroimaging datasets designed to produce large-scale maps of the connections and the organization of the brain lies in the sheer size of these data. For instance, electron microscopic (EM) images of a cubic millimeter of cortex occupies roughly 3 PBon disk, and lower resolution emerging X-ray microtomography (XRM) data can exceed 10 TB for a single mouse brain. When dealing with datasets of this size, the application of even simple algorithms becomes difficult. The size of datasets also exacerbates the considerable challenges for dissemination, reproducibility, and collaboration across laboratories. Addressing these challenges requires a new approach that leverages state-of-the-art computer science technology while remaining conscientious of the underlying bioinformatics. We propose Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research (SABER), a user-friendly and portable framework that automates the retrieval, extraction, and analysis of large-scale imagery data to facilitate neuroscientific analyses. SABER aims to improve the reliability and reproducibility of neuroimagery research by providing a common substrate upon which algorithms may be developed. Leveraging SABER’s containers — a standardized packaging for software — this substrate can then be trivially transferred to other machines by the same researcher or by other teams aiming to reproduce or adapt the prior work, making sharing workflows and extracting knowledge commonplace. Using SABER will ensure that the analysis runs identically, regardless of by whom or where the workflow is executed. Because developing and deploying these analysis solutions for large image volumes are acute barriers to developing consistently reproducible workflows, SABER will further the neuroscientific analysis community by simplifying the workflow-development and workflow-execution steps. To demonstrate this, we plan to distribute two community-vetted, optimized workflows to convert large-scale EM and XRM volumetric imagery into maps of neuronal connectivity. Many neurological diseases are characterized by their impact on the density of cells and vessels, neuron death, connectivity, or other factors that are visible with imaging technologies. SABER will provide a framework for producing reproducible estimates of cell counts, vasculature density, and connectomes, thus enabling increased understanding of the impact of disease on the neuroanatomy of many brains. This work will enable the development of tools that can both be applied to massive data and shared amongst many scientists, which will in turn accelerate progress and neuroscientific discovery. Project Narrative: Our Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory team leverages prior neuroscience analysis experience to present SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research — a portable, easy-to-install framework that enables large-scale neuroanatomical data processing by providing a scaffold upon which highly-reproducible bioinformatics protocols may be built. To support emerging efforts to understand the biological basis of disease, we demonstrate turn-key pipelines to translate multi-terabyte electron microscopy and X-ray microtomography data volumes into maps of neuronal connectivity.",SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy,9733348,R24MH114799,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Arm', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Density', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Grant', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Physics', 'Pluto', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'brain research', 'brain tissue', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'data access', 'data archive', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'relating to nervous system', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user-friendly', 'virtual technology']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R24,2019,379357,0.03126519626446925
"Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks The mammalian brain is believed to be optimally designed for robust and adaptable computation of the sensory inputs from the world, with respect to both its hardware (network structure) and software (network dynamics). The precise connections between the intricate structural connectivity and the rich network dynamics, however, are yet unknown. Moreover, our understanding of how the network structure and dynamics shape (or are shaped by) underlying coding principles in the brain network, is limited. My research plan proposes to close this gap by leveraging rich dataset obtained by state-of-art experimental techniques at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and innovative mathematical methods.  Specifically, my project aims to 1) link network structure and dynamic information processing in the brain, and to 2) bridge the gap between detailed biophysiological mechanisms and overarching neural coding principles with a focus on predictive coding theory, using data-driven mathematical models. To address Aim 1, I will investigate how network dynamics measured by synchronizability, metastability, and integrated information depend on local and global structure of the network. I will then study whether the experimentally obtained mouse brain connectome has optimal connectivity structures for unique dynamical characteristics. These analyses will be extended to the cell-type and layer-specific brain connectivity, based on the latest Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity data obtained from Cre-transgenic mice. During the independent phase, I will investigate whether brain-like networks can be evolved from optimization of dynamic measures. Regarding Aim 2, I will analyze data obtained from my current collaborative project which experimentally tests predictive coding models in the mouse visual cortex. In this study, we measure neural activity in response to expected and unexpected sequences of natural stimuli across three hierarchically related areas. Upon completion of the experiments, during the mentored phase, I will investigate mapping of algorithmic units in predictive coding models to neuronal populations in different layers. During my independent career period, I will extend the predictive coding model to incorporate active sensing and thalamo-cortical circuitries.  The project during the mentored phase will be carried out at the University of Washington which provides a highly interdisciplinary environment and offers the ideal training for me to become an independent researcher. I will also have access to rich resources and outstanding collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. I will have two mentors, one from the University of Washington and another from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. This unique setup will allow me to study mathematical models based on experimental data obtained by cutting-edge techniques with guidance from mentors with strong theoretical backgrounds. With theories closely tied to experiments, I believe my proposed project will contribute to our understanding of the connection between structure and computation of the neuronal network, addressing BRAIN initiative’s high priorities. The proposed research aims to probe how adaptable sensory coding arises from intricate connectivity structure and dynamics of the brain network at multiple scales. This study will contribute to our understanding of connections between unique structure and dynamics of the brain network as well as the mapping of complex neuronal dynamics in the cortical circuitry to algorithmic nodes in predictive coding models. By combining cutting-edge experimental and theoretical tools, this project will contribute to identifying fundamental principles underlying emergence of cognition and perception from neuronal network dynamics.","Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks",9804370,K99EY030840,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive control', 'collaborative environment', 'connectome', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'object recognition', 'predictive test', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'theories', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,128619,0.022198821894111553
"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions. The starting point of the project is our earlier discovery that phase structure in oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) of hippocampal areas CA1/CA3 carry location information in exquisite detail (Agarwal et al. 2014). We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations. The computational description level will leverage ideas of vector symbolic architectures, a class of connectionist models originally proposed for describing cognitive reasoning (Plate, 1995; Kanerva, 1996). Models produced by the software tool will concisely encapsulate assumptions about the computation and its implementation of a brain function and produce predictions that can be tested in a next generation of recording experiments. The proposed theory framework will be tested in building models for navigation in hippocampus and for visual processing in areas V1 and V4 in cortex. Project narrative: A key difficulty with inferring brain function from recordings of neural activity in a working brain is that the dynamics of individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Here we address this problem by delivering new tools for decoding and decomposing neural population activity, leveraging the recent discovery by the PI of behavior-specific phase structure of local field potentials. Further, we provide software and a theoretical framework for describing models of brain function on a computational and mechanistic level that can produce testable predictions for a new generation of brain recording experiments.",Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings,9789876,R01EB026955,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Encapsulated', 'Fostering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'area V1', 'area V4', 'base', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'independent component analysis', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'presynaptic', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'visual processing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,20717,0.011199015237452564
"Towards integrated 3D reconstruction of whole human brains at subcellular resolution Project Summary A detailed understanding of the anatomical and molecular architectures of brain cells and their brain-wide organization is essential for interrogating human brain function and dysfunction. Extensive efforts have been made toward mapping brain cells through various lenses, which have established invaluable databases yielding new insights. However, integrative extraction of the multimodal properties of various cell-types brain-wide within the same brain, crucial to elucidating complex intercellular relationships, remains nearly impossible. We have developed high-throughput, cost-effective technology platforms to create a fully integrated three-dimensional (3D) human brain cell atlas by simultaneously mapping high-dimensional features (e.g., spatial, molecular, morphological, and microenvironment information) of all cells acquired from the same whole brain. The proposed work will establish the most comprehensive 3D human brain map to date, with unprecedented resolution and completeness. We envision that this atlas will facilitate the integration of a broad range of studies and allow the research community to interrogate human brain structure and function at multiple levels. In Aim 1, we will apply a novel technology to transform whole human brain tissue into indestructible hydrogel–tissue hybrids that allow highly multiplexed molecular labeling and subcellular-resolution volume imaging. In Aim 2, we will apply scalable labeling and imaging technologies to map the brain-wide 3D distribution of various cell-type and structural markers at subcellular resolution within the same brain. Our chemical engineering–based approach to this aim will enable cost-effective, lossless 3D labeling of the entire human brain at lower cost as traditional subsampling approaches. True volume labeling and subcellular-resolution imaging will allow us to extract fine morphological and connectivity information from labeled cells and reconstruct the microenvironment of all cells. In Aim 3, we will use a host of rapid and highly automated algorithms to perform unbiased, integrative high- dimensional phenotyping of all cells based on their spatial location, molecular expression, morphology, and microenvironment. In Aim 4, we will perform super-resolution phenotyping of cells in a selected brain region from the same sample used in Aim 3 to map inter-areal axonal connectivity at single-fiber resolution and to characterize chemical synapses. This integrative approach will likely unveil unique cell-types and brain regions, a crucial step toward a better understanding of brain function. The complete 3D dataset will be linked to magnetic resonance and diffusion spectrum images and existing reference atlases to facilitate the integration of a wide breadth of study at multiple levels and to make the data publicly accessible for mining and analysis. A detailed picture of the human brain’s complex intermolecular, intercellular, and interareal interactions is of paramount importance for understanding its function and dysfunction. However, the immense complexity of the human brain and the absence of enabling technologies have hither-to made it impossible to interrogate these interactions brain-wide. Here we propose to use a host of new technology platforms to create a fully integrated whole human brain cell atlas with unprecedented levels of resolution and completeness.",Towards integrated 3D reconstruction of whole human brains at subcellular resolution,9768578,U01MH117072,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebral hemisphere', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Chemical Synapse', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Cytoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Fiber', 'Formalin', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'antibody libraries', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'lens', 'macromolecule', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'spectrograph', 'two-photon']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U01,2019,2003389,0.030124380518778013
"Automating whole brain connectomics: development, validation, and application of an open toolkit Project Summary/Abstract We have recently published a 3D electron microscopy volume of the whole fruit fly brain. However mapping of synaptic `wiring diagrams' or connectomes of neuronal circuits from this volume is currently completely manual and therefore slow. Our long-term goal is to increase understanding of how circuits process and transform information, both by accelerating connectomics mapping, and increasing the power and accessibility of analysis tools. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) provide newly available whole-brain segmentations to the user community, by extending the widely used, web-based circuit-mapping and analysis platform, CATMAID; and (ii) develop, validate, and apply new analysis tools for delivering insight into circuit structure. These objectives will be achieved through three specific aims: 1) Deploy automatic segmentations to a CATMAID server where members of the fly neurobiology community can create and manage their own collaborative projects; 2) Provide integrated, scalable, and cross-modal software for analysis of connectomes and neurogeometry; and 3) Complete proof-of-principle projects using this infrastructure, including the first whole-brain tractography database, a study of stereotypy in position, number and connectivity of tracts and identified cell types, and a complete map of microconnectivity in the calyx of the mushroom body. In Aim 1, two recently generated whole-brain segmentations of all neurites and all synaptic clefts will be skeletonized, imported into CATMAID, and provided for use by the fly neurobiologists (>20 labs immediately; the entire community shortly thereafter). In Aim 2, tools for shape-based neuron search will be integrated into CATMAID, allowing online databases of cell type morphology to assist the reconstruction workflow and find genetic driver lines for behavior and physiology experiments at the bench. Analysis software will be written for automated tractography, location of contralateral circuit element equivalents, and identification of synaptic partners. In Aim 3, this infrastructure will be used in proof-of-principle analyses designed to test and guide infrastructure development, while providing important biological contributions in their own right. The proposed research is innovative because it will: almost immediately provide segmentation-assisted circuit reconstruction to the fly community in the whole fly brain dataset; provide powerful new analysis tools; and enable individual labs to form and manage their own public or private collaborations in an expertly managed server environment. The proposed research is significant because acceleration of circuit mapping will greatly increase our understanding of information processing in the brain of an important animal model system, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster; further, these tools will be applicable to diverse brain tissues and organisms. Ultimately, this infrastructure will therefore contribute to a qualitatively improved understanding of how neuronal circuits process and store information across phyla. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it provides a new and cutting-edge strategy to accelerate mapping of brain circuits at a synaptic level, a prerequisite to understanding circuit function in normal and diseased brains. The proposed infrastructure is relevant to the part of the BRAIN Initiative's mission that pertains to revolutionizing our understanding of brain function through tool development and improved data analysis technologies.","Automating whole brain connectomics: development, validation, and application of an open toolkit",9822552,RF1MH120679,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Automated Annotation', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cerebral hemisphere', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Mushroom Bodies', 'Neurites', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Skeleton', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'improved', 'information processing', 'infrastructure development', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light microscopy', 'member', 'microscopic imaging', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'stereotypy', 'tool', 'tool development', 'tractography']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,RF1,2019,1910784,0.007063728394221547
"Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma Project Summary Childhood trauma dramatically increases the risk of adult psychiatric illness and significantly alters symptom complexity and treatment outcomes. Discovering causal factors and novel interventions could have a dramatic impact on treating psychiatric illness. Over the past decade, there has been a growing appreciation for the role of the gut microbiota in normal brain development and behavior and of critical modulatory effects of the gut microbiota on mental health. Interactions of microbiota with stress-related hormonal, immune, and inflammatory processes in the brain are particularly well supported. Thus, there is intense interest in understanding how interactions among stress, microbiome, and brain (the “stress-biome-brain” axis; SBB) contribute to a significant impact on mental health. We will address the hypothesis that adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. First, we will characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics in mice following recurrent trauma. Mice exposed to recurrent predation stress or to control conditions will be assessed for changes in the gut microbiota, hippocampal gene expression, and behavior. We will use these data to construct multi-level models and predict causal interactions among stress, microbiome, brain, and behavior. Next, we will test the hypothesis that changes in the gut microbiota induced by childhood trauma have causal effects in the brain. We will perform fecal transplants from trauma-exposed mice into naïve mice and measure changes in brain gene expression. These experiments will be performed in a germ-free mouse facility in mice with a small specified number of species, for precise control of microbial content. In addition, we will test strategies for perturbation of the microbial community and to assess behavioral outcomes in the germ-free facility. The data generated will set the stage for precision perturbation studies of the microbiota and its effects on behavior and for future translational studies. Project Narrative Adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome may contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. We will conduct experiments designed to characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics using state of the art genomics and systems biology. The results will provide a ranked list of the factors predicted to drive neuronal and behavioral responses across the system and will form the framework to test their causality.",Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma,9821596,R21MH118597,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early-life trauma', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predatory Behavior', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Trauma', 'Trauma recovery', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'comparative', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fecal transplantation', 'genome sciences', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'multilevel analysis', 'network models', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'synergism', 'translational study', 'trauma exposure', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2019,231602,-0.01654448420752565
"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9670105,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'adult obesity', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'immunoregulation', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'professional atmosphere', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2019,202731,0.033671486339016767
"Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome Project Summary/Abstract The high risk of neurodevelopmental impairments is a major concern for parents and clinicians caring for premature babies. Annually, approximately 22,000 very preterm infants (i.e. ≤32 weeks gestational age) in the United States develop cognitive deficits. Efforts to target interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental sequelae are hampered by our current inability to diagnose disabilities before the age of 3 to 5 years. Research supports the notion that cognitive deficits may result from a perturbation of neural connection and communication. Recent brain connectome studies in adults and older children show that abnormal network properties are useful as prognostic biomarkers. Many of these studies have exploited machine learning models based on brain connectome data for the prediction of a variety of neurological conditions, however this progress has not been fully extended to the preterm population. Our preliminary studies suggest that early and accurate prediction of cognitive deficits at an individual level is possible using machine learning models based on brain connectome features at term corrected age (CA). We have correctly classified 91.3% of very preterm infants at high risk of cognitive deficits with 90% specificity and 92.3% sensitivity. Our overall objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that can analyze integrated structural and functional brain connectome data obtained at term CA to make a prediction of later cognitive deficits in very preterm infants. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning techniques analyzing integrated structural and functional brain connectome features at birth can predict cognitive deficits at 2 years CA at an individual level in very preterm infants with accuracy of greater than 90%, exceeding the performance of current classical multivariate analyses. The two specific aims to test the central hypothesis are: 1) Develop and implement a machine learning model to extract high-level brain connectome features and 2) Develop and validate a machine learning framework to predict cognitive deficits. On completion of the first aim, we will explicate the brain connectome, and extract high-dimensional connectome features that best represent the brain connectome. In the second aim, the machine learning model we proposed will be applied in predicting both cognitive deficit (i.e. 2-class classification) and cognitive scores on a continuous scale (i.e., regression) at 2 years CA. To quantify the model's discrimination, we will also validate its performance in data that are not used for the model development, and compare with the current conventional multivariate approach. The proposed research is significant because it will increase scientific knowledge about the developing brain connectome in very preterm infants and facilitate earlier identification of babies at high risk of neurodevelopmental deficits, allowing timely clinical interventions for optimal cognitive outcome. Project Narrative Babies born before 32 weeks' gestational age are at a very high risk of developing cognitive deficits, which may impact their brain function in many ways, including life-long learning difficulties. Fortunately, infant brains are highly malleable, so it is important to identify those at highest risk as early as possible to allow effective early interventions. We propose to apply a reliable, accurate and sensitive artificial intelligence approach based on state-of-the-art brain MRI to allow identification of babies at highest risk of learning difficulties.",Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome,9432651,R21HD094085,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Premature Infant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'connectome', 'disability', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'interest', 'life-long learning', 'medical complication', 'model development', 'neonate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2018,198750,-0.0014180820301407165
"ADNI Psychometrics: fcMRI and Machine Learning Aim 2 Supplement Project Summary/Abstract This supplement is to a funded R01 called ADNI Psychometrics. This Supplement builds on the Second Specific Aim of the funded parent grant. That Aim focused on characterizing brain structure and functioning for people with different cognitively- defined subgroups of Alzheimer's disease. The Supplement adds one technique for analyzing the structural data we are already analyzing, and adds analyses of functional data we had not previously been planning to analyze. The new technique for structural data is machine learning. We have the opportunity to collaborate with a talented faculty member in Biomedical Informatics who has specific expertise in machine learning approaches to anatomical data (J Gennari). Dr. Genarri will supervise machine learning approaches to complement the various analytical approaches we already have underway for Aim 2. The new functional data analyses incorporate measurements of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) data from resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) data collected by ADNI. Those data enable the characterization of functional connectivity. There are many levels of correlation in the analyses of longitudinal fcMRI data, and another talented faculty member in Radiology has specific expertise in analyzing these data (T Madhyastha). Dr. Madhyastha will supervise analyses of longitudinal fcMRI data from the cognitively-defined subgroups of Aim 2, which will provide important additional information regarding whether the functional connectivity patterns of people in these subgroups are similar to or different from each other. Project Narrative This Supplement proposal builds on the second aim of R01 AG 029672, ""ADNI Psychometrics (P Crane, PI) , which is to use ADNI's rich neuroimaging data to compare metabolism and brain structure correlates of cognitively defined Alzheimer's disease subgroups.

Quarles, Ph.D., Chief Scientist, The Optical Society  2010 Massachusetts Ave, NW, Washington, DC  gquarles@osa.org, 202-416-1954 Project Summary /Abstract:  The 2018 OSA Biophotonics Congress: Biomedical Optics, 3-6 April 2018, Hollywood, FL, consists of four topical meetings. Within this congress, the Optics and the Brain Conference is specifically focused on cutting-edge research and innovative new tools and techniques that seek to increase fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system. This proposal is to provide registration and travel support for students, early career professionals, and underrepresented speakers that will present on optics and the brain topics within this meeting.  The 2018 OSA Optics and the Brain conference was founded in 2015 in response to the USA BRAIN Initiative and the European Human Brain Project. These initiatives have identified the urgent need for new technologies that can probe the working brain across all levels from single neurons to entire behaving organisms. Optics offers a unique toolkit for multiscale imaging the living and intact brain, while new genetic labeling strategies provide optical contrast to neural function and optogenetics permits the control of cellular function with light. Optics and the Brain is thus an important, highly interdisciplinary area of research that combines broad aspects of neuroscience, biology, medicine, physics, chemistry and engineering. This year the program is adding more topics to be able to better explore new tools, the use of artificial intelligence in machine learning and technologies that will allow doctors to explore larger, deeper sections of the brain.  The general purpose of this congress with co-located meetings is to create an inclusive, open forum for the presentation of high-quality scientific research through plenary and technical sessions, short courses, panels, networking and special events. This method of face-to-face information sharing allows researchers to learn what others in their field and related disciplines are doing and to efficiently learn about new research, tools, and techniques that might be relevant to their work. It allows conversations with colleagues from different institutions around the world and engenders far reaching scientific collaborations – both domestic and international. In addition, this meeting provides an opportunity for students and early career professionals to present their work, participate in professional development activities, and to hear from and network with internationally-renowned invited speakers who represent the broad diversity of optics and the brain related research. Ultimately this meeting, where best-in-class research is presented and discussed will advance knowledge in the field of biomedical optics and biophotonics and propel technological development forward.

"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9486921,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,549838,0.045470830380726246
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9493548,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2018,163943,0.037498827503311495
"Assessing the Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation on Agency Project Summary Recent advances in neurotechnologies have provided us with the ability to modulate brain function by direct and indirect interventions. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is one such intervention that has already been FDA-approved for certain disorders, and its use has already raised ethical questions about ways in which direct brain stimulation may affect personal identity, autonomy, authenticity and, more generally, agency. Thus far the neuroethical worries have been largely based on anecdotal clinical reports. Further neurotechnological interventions developed as part of the BRAIN initiative are bound to raise similar questions, but we lack a clear framework in which to think of the ethical consequences of these interventions. The overall goal of this project is to articulate such a framework, to enable us to better evaluate and respond to the neuroethical challenges raised by our abilities to alter brain function. The more concrete objectives of our proposal are to 1) develop comprehensive assessment tools to measure changes in agency due to direct brain interventions, 2) to use this tool to assess changes in agency due to brain interventions using DBS patient populations as a test case; and 3) to develop a database to house the data we acquire with these tools to allow us to catalogue the effects and side effects of DBS. This will also make it possible to correlate the effects of DBS with electrode placement and white matter tractography, enabling better prediction of outcomes and aid in understanding of the mechanisms by which DBS works. We will analyze this data machine with machine learning methods to inform a more comprehensive neuroethical analysis of how brain interventions affect agency. Our approach is innovative in that it applies neurophilosophical insights about agency and employs deep learning algorithms in constructing and evaluating these assessment instruments. This contribution is significant in that it will provide a broad based assessment tool and database that will be a resource for researchers and clinicians using DBS, which could be used to improve therapeutic approaches and informed consent. The data will also inform a framework for further neuroethical thought about brain interventions, allowing us to better identify, articulate and measure changes on “dimensions of agency.” Finally, the approach is generalizable, and thus could be adapted for use with other brain intervention techniques, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) or pharmacological treatments.   Project Narrative: We aim to develop a computerized assessment tool (the Agency Assessment Tool, AAT) to be used by clinicians prior to and after brain interventions to measure changes in agency along multiple dimensions. We will also develop an anonymous database coupled to the AAT that will constitute a central repository for data documenting the effects of DBS. Machine learning methods will be used to build predictive models from the AAT data in order to provide neuroethically relevant predictive and diagnostic information about the effects of brain interventions on agency. ",Assessing the Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation on Agency,9609947,RF1MH117813,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Bioethics', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Competence', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Ethicists', 'Ethics', 'FDA approved', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Informed Consent', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Personhood', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroethics', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'neurotechnology', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'preimplantation', 'tool', 'tractography', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'white matter']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,RF1,2018,239475,0.05128151664533971
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9422606,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'serial imaging', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,451650,0.0016114495582846143
"Deep Learning for Connectomics Project Summary/Abstract The brain contains a vast number of neurons that are connected with each other through synapses, thereby forming a complex anatomical network that mediates information ﬂow within the brain. The brain “wiring diagram” will be a foundational tool for elucidating the function and dysfunction of brains. Electron microscopy (EM) is widely considered to be the gold standard for neuronal level circuit recon- struction. Currently, a major and serious bottleneck in this ﬁeld is image segmentation and reconstruc- tion. It is estimated that the data analysis accuracy and throughput are lagging behind data acquisition by orders of magnitude. This project aims at dramatically improving the accuracy and throughput of brain EM image analysis, thereby enabling accurate and efﬁcient reconstruction of neuronal level brain maps. Speciﬁcally, this project is built up on the recent success in deep learning methods, which are dominant tools for EM image analysis. A central and unresolved challenge of using deep learning for segmentation is how to achieve the conﬂicting goals of integrating sufﬁcient contextual features while preserving full-resolution information. This project will develop a novel residual encoder-decoder model to achieve these two goals simultaneously (Aim 1). In current deep learning segmentation methods, the labels of each pixel are predicted independently. To fully consider the brain topological structure and couple the predictions of spatially adjacent pixels, this project will develop a hybrid recurrent and convo- lutional network model (Aim 2). In this model, the recurrent network is integrated with the convolutional network to incorporate the multi-dimensional structural information. When combined with Aim 1, these methods are expected to dramatically improve the accuracy of EM image segmentation. In most cur- rent deep learning segmentation methods, the training and/or prediction stages require the extraction of patches centered on each pixel. This step forms a bottleneck that limits the overall throughput. This project will develop novel techniques to achieve whole-image training and prediction (Aim 3). These approaches will enable very efﬁcient training and segmentation, thereby dramatically increasing the throughput of EM image analysis. Project narrative Wiring diagrams of the brain circuits serve as a foundational tool for studying brain function and dys- function. This project aims at developing advanced computational methods for boosting the accuracy and throughput of brain circuit reconstruction from electron microscopy images.

"Construction of a high-resolution human tractography atlas and its related toolbox PROJECT SUMMARY Mapping the human connectome and exploring its characteristics is one of the largest endeavors in the neuroscience field, but a detailed tractography atlas that provides the 3D trajectories in a standard space has yet to be constructed and validated. A tractography atlas can provide neuroanatomical insight into the structural organization of the human brain and allow for modeling, simulation, and confirmation of cortical connections to facilitate the new development of treatment and intervention for brain diseases. In this study, we propose to construct a high spatial and angular resolution tractography atlas using a large sample of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) diffusion MRI data, averaging them into a template for fiber tracking, validating the tracks by post-mortem Klingler microdissection on 100 cadavers under a neurosurgery microscope digitized using high resolution 3D scanners, and building a deep learning toolbox that allows for automatic track recognition in individuals. This study will construct the most detailed and accurate tractography of human connectome and provide a novel toolbox for future HCP data analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will construct an atlas of human brain fiber pathways and a related toolbox for track- specific analysis, aiming to understand the structural characteristics of brain connections in healthy individuals and provide track-specific analysis for brain imaging data.",Construction of a high-resolution human tractography atlas and its related toolbox,9771640,R56MH113634,"['Algorithms', 'Aphasia', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cadaver', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Microdissection', 'Microscope', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain research', 'clinical application', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'experience', 'human data', 'human subject', 'insight', 'models and simulation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tractography', 'virtual', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R56,2018,452250,0.02642683108006593
"Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Project Summary/Abstract: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Brain monitoring in critical care has grown dramatically over the past 20 years with the discovery that a large proportion of ICU patients suffer from subclinical seizures and seizure-like electrical events, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), detectable only by electroencephalography (EEG). This growth has created a crisis in critical care: It is clear that IIICAs damage the brain and cause permanent neurologic disability. Yet detection of IIICAs by expert visual review is often delayed suggesting we need better tools for real-time monitoring, to cope with the deluge of ICU EEG data. In other cases, IIICAs appear to be harmless epiphenomena, and many worry that increased awareness of IIICAs has created an epidemic of overly-aggressive prescribing of anticonvulsant drugs leading to preventable adverse events and costs. This crisis highlights critical unmet needs for automated EEG monitoring for IIICAs, and a better understanding of which types of IIICAs cause neural injury and warrant intervention. Causes of IIICAs range widely, from primary brain injuries like hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, to systemic medical illnesses like sepsis and uremia. Until recently, this massive clinical heterogeneity has been an insurmountable barrier to understanding the impact of IIICAs on neurologic outcome. However, recent advances in deep learning, coupled with the unprecedented availability of a massive dataset developed by our team over the last three years, makes it feasible for the first time to systematically study the relationship between IIICAs and neurologic outcomes. To meet the need for better monitoring tools and better models for understanding IIICAs, we will take a deep learning approach to leverage the as-yet untapped information in a massive ICU EEG dataset. We will pursue three Specific Aims: SA1: Comprehensively label all occurrences of IIICAs in a massive set of cEEG recordings, thus preparing the EEG data for training computers to detect IIICA patterns; SA2: Develop supervised DL algorithms to detect IIICAs as accurately as human experts, thus providing powerful tools for both research on IIICAs and for clinical brain monitoring; SA3: Estimate the effect of IIICAs on neurologic outcome: we will develop models to quantify effects of IIICAs on risk for disability after controlling for inciting illness and other clinical factors, and to predict effects of interventions to suppress IIICAs. This work will provide four crucial benefits to advance the field of precision critical care neurology, and by extension, our ability to provide optimal neurologic care for patients during critical illness. 1) Improved understanding of the clinical significance of seizure like IIICA states; 2) development of robust tools and algorithms for critical care brain telemetry; 3) a unique, massive, publicly available, thoroughly annotated dataset that will enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials. Project Narrative: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum RELEVANCE: Seizures and seizure-like brain activity, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), occur commonly in electroencephalogram recordings of brain activity in ICU patients, and simultaneously represent a preventable cause of brain injury and a common cause of over-treatment and iatrogenic harm to patients. Big Data and deep learning approaches have recently enabled advances in several fields of medicine, but have so far had little impact in ICU neuromedicine. This project will use Big Data and Deep Learning to advance the goal of protecting brain health in ICU patients, by 1) providing improved understanding of the clinical significance of IIICA states; 2) developing robust tools and algorithms for ICU brain telemetry; 3) creating a unique, massive, publicly available, annotated dataset to enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) developing a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials.",Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum,9574149,R01NS107291,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthetics', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Label', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurology', 'Nomenclature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Supervision', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uremia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'brain health', 'causal model', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'nerve injury', 'neurophysiology', 'overtreatment', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'real time monitoring', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,579883,-0.011320112535543443
"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9548265,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'forest', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,1,0.012574783197467965
"Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities PROJECT SUMMARY  Establishing the incremental predictive validity of neuroimaging is a critical prerequisite for this technology's clinical or educational use outside of medical settings. If specific, well-validated neuroimaging tools provide little to no information above that of clinical interview or neuropsychological assessment, the use and funding of those tools should be more critically evaluated against other methods or funding priorities. If neuroimaging demonstrates unique predictive power for assessment or prediction purposes, however, it may aid in the identification of concerning developmental trajectories, the provision of early intervention, or the prediction of individuals' response to specific interventions. Preliminary data from the applicant's laboratory has demonstrated unique contributions of structural neuroimaging to individual differences in reading and attention using confirmatory structural equation modeling, but these questions have yet to be addressed using a data- driven feature-reduction approach that considers numerous types of demographic, behavioral, and brain- derived measures. This proposal focuses explicitly on structural neuroimaging as it is more easily and more consistently obtained than functional imaging in clinical and research environments, and recent findings indicate that it may even be more highly predictive of behavior than functional imaging. In light of these considerations, this proposal will utilize supervised machine learning to assess the incremental validity of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment.  The goals are this project are to (1) develop and evaluate demographic- and behavior-based predictive models of individuals' reading, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity, (2) replicate and then add neuroanatomical features to these models in order to test structural neuroimaging's incremental predictive validity, and (3) test these models' specificity and discriminant validity for measuring the intended constructs. The long-term goal of this proposal is thus to expand upon the applicant's background in individual difference analyses by developing skills in machine learning so that the incremental validity of multiple neuroimaging modalities can eventually be evaluated. The eventual development of a sufficiently validated predictive model could constitute a behavioral and/or brain-based signature that could serve, along with contextual and functional considerations, as a quantifiable alternative to clinically-based diagnoses. These methods are but first steps toward this distant but worthwhile goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite decades of studies clarifying the cognitive and neurophysiological predictors of reading and attentional abilities, we're only marginally closer to a more meaningful science of individual prediction. The proposed study will utilize machine learning techniques to test the predictive power of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment. Beyond the potential for improved prediction of individuals' reading and attentional abilities, the models developed can be easily improved upon using new and preexisting data, thereby moving our field closer to an individualized science of performance- and brain-based markers that can improve early risk identification and evaluate intervention targets.",Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities,9559419,F31HD091967,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohols', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Distant', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'demographics', 'falls', 'improved', 'inattention', 'individual response', 'insight', 'mathematical ability', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'phonological awareness', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'processing speed', 'psychologic', 'reading ability', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'tractography']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,F31,2018,36505,0.03014880017909794
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Abstract (of the Parent Award) Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. This administrative supplement proposes to add a sample of unaffected siblings (n=100, 20 per site over four years) as an additional comparison sample to the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control (HC) subjects already being studied in the parent study. These siblings will complete the same clinical, neurocognitive, and imaging measures as the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control subjects complete in the parent study.",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9689131,R01MH113250,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Netherlands', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive task', 'disability', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,213060,0.04303246051985494
"C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative ABSTRACT The BRAIN Initiative is designed to leverage sophisticated neuromodulation, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging techniques in human and non-human animal models in order to develop a multilevel understanding of human brain function. However, the necessary tools for organizing, processing and analyzing neuroimaging data generated through these efforts are not widely available as coherent and easy-to- use software packages. Gaps are particularly apparent for nonhuman data (i.e., monkey, rodent), as most of the existing processing and analytic software packages are specifically designed for human imaging. Methods have been proposed for addressing the challenges inherent to the processing of nonhuman data (e.g., brain extraction, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, brain parcellation, temporal denoising); to date, these have not been readily integrated into an easy-to-use, robust, and reproducible analysis package. Similarly, many of the sophisticated machine learning and modeling methods developed for neuroimaging analyses are inaccessible to most researchers because they have not been integrated into easy-to-use pipeline software. As a result, translational and comparative neuroimaging researchers patch together neuroinformatics pipelines that use various combinations of disparate software packages and in-house code. We propose to extend the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) open-source software to provide robust and reproducible pipelines for functional and structural MRI data. We will integrate the various disparate image processing and analysis methods used to handle the challenges of nonhuman imaging data, into a single, open source, configurable, easy-to-use end-to-end analysis pipeline package that is accessible locally or via the cloud. The end product will not only improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of nonhuman translational and comparative imaging, but also enable new avenues of scientific inquiry through our inclusion of methods that are yet to be applied to nonhuman imaging data (e.g., gradient- based cortical parcellation methods, hyperalignment). Specific aims of the proposed work include to: 1) Integrate neuroimaging processing and analysis methods optimized for BRAIN Initiative data, 2) Implement strategies for carrying out comparative studies of human and non-human populations, and 3) Extend C-PAC to include cutting-edge analytical strategies for identifying mechanisms of brain function. All development will occur “in the open” using GitHub and other collaborative tools to maximally involve participation in the C-PAC project. Annual hackathons will be held to collaborate with investigators from BRAIN Initiative awards and other neuroinformatics development projects to integrate their tools with C-PAC. Hands-on training will be held to train investigators on optimal use of the newly developed tools. NARRATIVE New neuroimaging analysis software is needed to process and analyze the various human and non-human neuroimaging data collected through the BRAIN Initiative. We will address this need by extending the already mature C-PAC human brain imaging data analysis pipeline to include support for animal data, with a particular focus on providing methods for conducting comparative studies between species. The proposed work will also include a toolbox for helping to align electrophysiological data that is commonly collected in non-human studies, with the brain imaging data.","C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative",9591465,R24MH114806,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Capital', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Software Design', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validity of Results', 'Work', 'animal data', 'base', 'brain research', 'cloud based', 'comparative', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'design', 'flexibility', 'graphical user interface', 'hackathon', 'human imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'investigator training', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuroregulation', 'open source', 'software as a service', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,"CHILD MIND INSTITUTE, INC.",R24,2018,507643,0.024541235947217372
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION PROJECT DESCRIPTION Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our proposal promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art “Connectome Skyra”, an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of “Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering”, which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain’s white matter tracts.

"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project.

"Development of brain-computer interface methods to influence brain dynamics in stuttering Project summary Brain dynamics that drive variability within and between patients are an important, but poorly understood, element of many cognitive disorders. The long-term goal of this research project is to develop technology that will identify brain activity patterns associated with successful performance on a given task, and use this pattern as a target for brain-computer interface (BCI) training. The overarching hypothesis is that using BCI training to more often have a brain state that is spontaneously correlated to good performance will, in turn, improve overall performance. This approach could be developed into a powerful tool for rehabilitation and therapy for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here we will investigate persistent developmental stuttering (PDS) as a model to study brain dynamics associated with successful vs. unsuccessful performance. PDS is a speech disorder where fluent speech is punctuated to various degrees by stuttering. Individuals with PDS are otherwise neurologically in the normal range, which avoids complicating factors in most patient populations. Stuttering is intermittent; thus on some occasions the brain is in a state conducive to fluent speech and at other times it is not. We propose to use EEG activity shortly before speaking to predict whether somebody with PDS will stutter or speak fluently. Preliminary data are given to show proof of concept with traditional EEG analysis methods. This approach will be expanded by first using advanced methods such as common spatial pattern analysis and machine learning over multiple subject sessions to identify EEG signals that distinguish fluent vs. dysfluent trials (Aim 1). PDS subjects will then be trained to produce and maintain their EEG pattern that is most strongly associated with fluent speech by using BCI methods. We hypothesize that individuals will learn to modulate EEG features to be more consistent with fluent trials, which in turn will significantly reduce stuttering rate. After successful completion of this project we envision a new BCI-based intervention that can be used to encourage neural states conducive to fluent speech in those who stutter. The BCI intervention would complement traditional speech therapy using behavioral methods. The “two-step approach” of first identifying brain states associated with a patient’s best performance followed by BCI training to enter that state more often can be applied to rehabilitation in many other neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury, and mood disorders, to name a few. Project narrative The goal of this project is to develop brain-computer interface technology to optimize brain function on an individual basis. This could have therapeutic applications to many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and traumatic brain injury.",Development of brain-computer interface methods to influence brain dynamics in stuttering,9530270,R21DC016353,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Stuttering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Names', 'Neurologic', 'Normal Range', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stroke', 'Stuttering', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'improved', 'indexing', 'motor control', 'nervous system disorder', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R21,2018,216658,-0.05609517624024676
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9564206,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,465508,0.016344071794873585
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,9630167,R21MH118170,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Production', 'RNA', 'RNA Probes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'endophenotype', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual response', 'injured', 'injury and repair', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'manufacturability', 'medical attention', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'microchip', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'nanomagnetic', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nucleic acid detection', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ratiometric', 'research clinical testing', 'response to injury', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2018,206809,0.02980949351469416
"Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY During adolescence, the human brain undergoes marked structural and functional refinements to support rapid cognitive and behavioral development. However, the relationship between developing white matter architecture and emergent functional connectivity remains poorly understood. It is imperative to elucidate developmental mechanisms underlying structure-function coupling in youth, as devastating mental disorders such as psychosis have been linked to the disruption of evolving brain connectivity during this epoch. Specifically, psychosis has been characterized by the anomalous functional integration of brain processes. This could result from the aberrant wiring of white matter connections during brain development, from aberrant processes of functional plasticity (activity-dependent myelination of axons linking neurons within functionally-relevant circuits), or both. This proposal will apply cutting-edge network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal neuroimaging and rich clinical phenotyping data acquired as a part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n=503, ages 9-25 years old), a large community-based study of brain development. Moreover, the goal of this proposal is to (1) systematically characterize whether structural connectivity drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within brain modules, or vice versa, and (2) identify abnormalities of structure-function coupling associated with the longitudinal burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. This work will test the overarching hypothesis that structural connectivity precedes and drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within distinct brain modules, and further, that the aberrant development of structure-function coupling will be associated with increased burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide critical new insights regarding both typical brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental etiology of psychosis. Notably, as diverse types of psychopathology are increasingly linked to atypical brain maturation, findings generated by this study could lead to earlier diagnosis and enhanced treatment for individuals at risk for developing mental disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE It remains largely unknown how human white matter connectivity develops during adolescence to support brain function, and how abnormalities of structure-function coupling during this critical period may presage major psychiatric illnesses such as psychosis. By applying sophisticated network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal diffusion and functional neuroimaging data (n=503, ages 9-25 years), this study will provide important new insights regarding both healthy brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of psychosis. The findings generated by this study may allow for the development of earlier and more effective treatments for psychosis, which would benefit public health by reducing the great disability and cost associated with psychosis in youth.",Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis,9610925,F31MH115709,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'cost', 'critical period', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'functional plasticity', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'myelination', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2018,44524,0.07301987202622637
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9442865,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'source localization', 'surgery outcome']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2018,531286,0.02249813947802743
"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Integrating human connectomics and brain imaging genomics offers enormous potential, allowing us to perform systems biology approaches of the brain to better understand the interplay between genes, brain connectivity, and phenotypic outcomes (e.g., cognition, behavior, disorder). This proposal seeks to develop novel bioinformatics methods and software tools for integrative study of human connectomics and brain imaging genomics.

"Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques Project Summary / Abstract  Neuroimaging methodologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (s/fMRI) have emerged as significant predictors of substance use relapse. These neuroimaging techniques have helped provide an objective, sensitive, and predictive measure of substance use relapse propensity. As the capabilities of biological science advance, a lingering impediment to progress is the study of individual brain regions implicated in predicting substance use relapse. Important to note, individual brain regions rarely work independently; rather, such regions often work in concert, as specific networks, continually sending and receiving information to other regions, to help facilitate learning, memory, and other cognitive processes. The investigation of ICA-derived functional network connectivity between brain regions may lend incremental utility for classifying, diagnosing, and predicting substance use relapse.  Here, using the world’s largest forensic database, which includes clinical and neuropsychological measures, electrophysiological measures, functional neuroimaging, and functional network connectivity measures, the primary goal of this project will be to delineate specific risk factors predictive of eventual stimulant use relapse propensity. This will be accomplished by integrating models incorporating logistic and Cox proportional-hazard regressions, and cross-validation machine learning pattern classifiers to predict stimulant use relapse one year after institutional release with an at-risk sample of adult incarcerated offenders.  First, we will examine the potential of various clinical and neuropsychological assessment measures in predicting stimulant use relapse. Second, we will investigate the predictive utility of error-monitoring neural measures using traditional ERPs and fMRI in predicting stimulant use relapse. Third, we will apply more agnostic, data-driven methods, including ICA-derived functional network connectivity analyses of fMRI data to measure functional connectivity between brain regions involved in error-processing to predict stimulant use relapse. Ultimately, this research will lend incremental utility in the successful prediction of stimulant use relapse, providing a more sensitive and predictive measure compared to previous investigations. The ultimate goal of the proposed training fellowship is to help provide a more biologically informed taxonomy of neurocognitive deficits associated with those prone to stimulant use relapse. Project Narrative  Prevalence estimates indicate that roughly half of incarcerated offenders meet criteria for previous history of substance use disorders (SUDs) (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015), with a majority (66.7%) relapsing within three years of institutional release (Langan & Levin, 2002). Identifying specific risk factors, including neurocognitive measures involved in predicting stimulant use relapse following release from custody could lead to important insights into this high-risk sample. The research proposed here will examine brain anatomy, function and connectivity, and psychological traits using the world's largest multi- modal database of its kind from an incarcerated sample to directly aid the development of more contemporary, scientifically-validated taxonomy of the pathophysiology related to neurocognitive deficits associated with stimulant use relapse propensity.",Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques,9565939,F31DA043328,"['Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Fellowship', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Imprisonment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'New Mexico', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive process', 'court', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'hazard', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'stimulant use', 'symptomatology', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2018,27846,0.020798203240134955
"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and machine learning algorithms in the future.   Project Narrative The Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive) is a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects.",A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive,9565669,R24MH114788,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioconductor', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Familiarity', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Personnel Staffing', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'cloud storage', 'complex R', 'computerized data processing', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data resource', 'data submission', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'member', 'multiple omics', 'neural circuit', 'next generation', 'online resource', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'repository', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'web site', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2018,1293101,0.04974541063229002
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9503781,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2018,675630,0.04823505876450915
"Functional Dissection of Prenatal Drug Effects on the Developing Brain and Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY Despite efforts of prevention and education programs, licit and illicit drug use among pregnant women remains prevalent1. Most drugs of abuse easily cross the placenta and can alter the intricate balance among fetal neurotransmitters and receptors, which critically dictate in utero development of the brain's functional wiring system2-5. Therefore prenatal drug exposures (PDE) have long-lasting implications for brain and behavioral development since a small perturbation to the immature brain circuits may cascade into substantial deviations during long-term growth6. Existing behavioral studies provide converging evidence on the detrimental effects of PDE throughout development 1,6,7 but mechanistic studies of the brain basis of PDE remains scarce, especially during the infancy period. Nevertheless, studying the brain mechanisms of PDE during infancy is critical and urgently needed given that: 1) the infancy period immediately follows PDE insults and features the most dynamic postnatal brain development; 2) the infancy period is least confounded by postnatal environmental adversities that frequently accompany PDE; 3) identification of brain alterations associated with PDE during this stage has the best potential to guide early preventive intervention before behavioral problems onset. Our previous results8,9 demonstrated significant and widespread functional connectivity alterations in neonates prenatally exposed to cocaine and marijuana, respectively. However, three major areas need to be better delineated: 1) an overall picture of PDE effects on whole brain functional organization is lacking; 2) a more systematic delineation of the potential differential drug effects and their interactions is needed given the multi- drug exposure for most of the drug-abusing mothers; 3) the prediction power of detected neonatal functional alterations for later behavioral outcomes remains to be determined. Our long-term goal is to derive early functional-connectivity-based brain biomarkers for different PDEs that will reliably predict long-term behavioral outcomes. Our goal in this project is to derive neonate-based functional connectivity signatures for different PDEs and test their prediction power for 3-month behavioral outcomes. This project is significant because it is expected to be the first to identify drug-specific neurophenotypes for different PDEs on early brain functional and behavioral development, prior to the damaging postnatal influences that may accompany parental drug abuse. It is innovative because: 1) It will integrate resting-state brain functional connectivity and cognitive and behavioral function to quantify the potential drug-specific and drug-common effects on brain and behavior development in neonates; 2) It will apply detailed multi-level whole brain survey to discern differential drug-effect profiles and leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to better characterize their link with later behavioral outcomes. It is relevant to public health because it will provide currently unavailable knowledge of PDE effects on developing brain functional networks in neonates and inform earlier interventions that are documented to be most effective before symptom onset.

"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,9470490,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2018,554686,0.0019978356952043536
"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9518014,R01NS095741,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Education', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Problem behavior', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'gray matter', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'segregation', 'stroke patient', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,580306,-0.06684635207429618
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9468973,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2018,34421,0.004301672343449328
"Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity Project Summary Prescription opioids, e.g., oxycodone (OXY), are commonly encountered in youth and pose a significant public health problem. In addition, there are significant individual differences in subjective responses to opioids which contribute to vulnerabilities for misuse. However, little is understood about OXY's effects on brain function, or on how individual differences in these effects might relate to variations in subjective responses. Assessment of OXY's effects on brain function is critical to understanding its abuse liability a n d will provide insight into how and why this drug leads to misuse and abuse/dependence in some, but not all, individuals. This proposal will assess the effects of low-dose OXY (10mg) on whole-brain functional connectivity (FC), and explore relationships with subjective responses in healthy young adults (ages 21 to 30 years, N=40) with limited prior opioid exposure. OXY's effects on FC during both reward- processing and resting-state will be assessed using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design incorporating multiband fMRI scanning. Subjective measures of drug response (e.g., `drug liking') will be collected before, during and after neuroimaging using NIDA PhenX measures. Neuroimaging data will be analyzed using data-driven methods to facilitate assessment of OXY's effects on FC both within hypothesized networks (e.g., salience and reward networks) as well as on patterns of between- network connectivity. Specifically, FC changes following OXY versus placebo (Aim 1) and relationships between these changes and subjective drug responses (Aim 2) will be assessed using intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD). ICD is a data-driven, voxel-to-voxel method of assessing whole-brain connectivity patterns that is not limited by specification of seed regions or connectivity thresholds. In addition, connectome-based machine-learning will be used to build a predictive model of subjective responses to OXY using data acquired during placebo scans (Aim 3). This project will for the first time assess the effects of a prescription opioid on whole-brain FC. Understanding OXY's effects on large-scale network dynamics is crucial for understanding its abuse liability, and will guide future studies of OXY in addicted and at-risk populations. Identification of networks that are predictive of subjective responses to OXY is an essential first step toward finding a reliable biomarker of opioid response that will help to identify individuals at highest risk for misuse.

"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9534190,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,668364,0.0468302969197324
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9538116,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,679633,0.047801701280088114
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9568804,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,622284,-0.0024960205926466456
"Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network Project Summary: Skilled use of tools is a defining achievement of human cognition, and is enabled by the storage of tool-specific action memories. Many tools are associated with more than one action, and most everyday tasks are associated with more than one tool. Limb apraxia is a common, disabling, and puzzling left-hemisphere disorder characterized by prominent deficits in activating and selecting task-appropriate tool actions. Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms and brain regions enabling such selection in the neurologically intact brain, or how these processes go awry in apraxia. In several other cognitive domains, it has been suggested that appropriate response selection occurs via biased competition—that is, the prioritization of competing incoming information to enable appropriate response selection. Capitalizing on the promise of such frameworks, we have developed a new functional-neuroanatomic model of biased competition in a specific left hemisphere Tool Use network. Called “Two Action Systems Plus” (2AS+), the model generates testable hypotheses about the major principles determining tool action selection, and their deficiencies in apraxia. Specifically, we hypothesize that 1) Competition between tool actions is influenced by the graded similarity of tool action representations, as implemented primarily by the left posterior temporal cortex (pTC), 2) The outcome of the competitive process is affected by the strength and timing of activation of tool action representations, and depends on the dynamic interplay of left pTC and the parietal lobes, 3) Outcome is further influenced by a mechanism that biases competition towards the tool action that is appropriate to goals and context, as implemented by the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and its connections with the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and 4) There are two subtypes of apraxia characterized by distinct failures in the competitive selection process: an anterior subtype characterized by inability to appropriately resolve tool action competition, and a posterior subtype reflecting weakened competition. These hypotheses will be tested using a number of complementary methods with healthy and brain-lesioned participants, including voxel-based lesion symptom mapping, resting functional connectivity, fMRI with multi-voxel pattern analyses, and eyetracking. By specifying when and how visuomotor information plays a role in tool representations, the proposed experiments promise to critically constrain “embodied” cognition theories claiming that tools automatically evoke their actions. The proposed research will also advance the theoretical understanding of tool action by anchoring relevant constructs in a cognitive-neuroanatomic model, clarify how action representations are organized and activated, and improve our understanding of the mechanisms affecting errors and re-learning in apraxia, with implications for rehabilitation. Project Narrative: Apraxia, a disorder of tool use, is a common and substantially disabling consequence of left hemisphere stroke, yet is relatively rarely studied and hence poorly understood. The proposed work will clarify the brain regions that are associated with the disorder, the task factors that may improve tool use abilities, and the ability of the damaged Tool Use system to learn after stroke. This information will serve as an important building block in the development of treatment strategies.",Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network,9494731,R01NS099061,"['Achievement', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Apraxias', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cheese', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'novel', 'response', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'visual motor']",NINDS,ALBERT EINSTEIN HEALTHCARE NETWORK,R01,2018,381860,-0.0017925637019444785

A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the “gateway interactions” between use of different substances. This hub’s Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factors, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

"Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging Project Summary. Neuroimaging is poised to take a substantial leap forward in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of human behavior, due to a combination of improved analytic techniques and the quality of imaging data. These advances are allowing researchers to develop population-level multivariate models of the functional brain representations underlying behavior, performance, clinical status and prognosis, and other outcomes. Population-based models can identify patterns of brain activity, or `signatures', that can predict behavior and decode mental states in new individuals, producing generalizable knowledge and highly reproducible maps. These signatures can capture behavior with large effect sizes, and can be used and tested across research groups. However, the potential of such signatures is limited by neuroanatomical constraints, in particular individual variation in functional brain anatomy. To circumvent this problem, current models are either applied only to individual participants, severely limiting generalizability, or force participants' data into anatomical reference spaces (atlases) that do not respect individual functional topology and boundaries. Here we seek to overcome this shortcoming by developing new topological models for inter-subject alignment, which register participants' functional brain maps to one another. This will increase effective spatial resolution, and more importantly allow us to explicitly analyze the spatial topology of functional maps make inferences on differences in activation location and shape across persons and psychological states. We will test and validate the methods using a purpose-designed experiment (n = 120) that includes two types of naturalistic narrative experiences (movies and audio stories) and tasks from three functional domains (pain, emotion, and cognition). The tasks are designed with several constraints in mind, including: (1) systematic coverage of cognitive, emotional, and sensory tasks matched in stimulus properties (e.g., stimulus duration); and (2) multiple levels of task demand within each task, to permit parametric modeling and prediction of demand levels. We will compare our new methods to existing methods based on out-of-sample effect sizes in predicting behavior and test-retest reliability. We will make the analytic methods, software, and dataset available to other researchers, along with a library of functional reference spaces for multiple psychological states. Project Narrative. We develop new methods for enhancing the development of models that can predict behavior, clinical status, and other outcomes using neuroimaging data. Successful development will help improve the translational impact of neuroimaging. It will also contribute to developing multidisciplinary neuroscience, by promoting the development of neural signatures for specific mental processes in humans with increased precision and specificity.",Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging,9577381,R01EB026549,"['Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Charon', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gaussian model', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Processes', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Wages', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'mental state', 'model development', 'movie', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'statistics', 'translational impact']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,710896,0.019798457228031363
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9524072,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,724280,0.011118310085147326
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior. We employ a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate this interaction during a variety of cognitive tasks.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,9415056,R01MH071589,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Paper', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual attention', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive task', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'motivated behavior', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'reward processing', 'theories']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,523129,0.011888150498367842
"RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data Project Summary/Abstract  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allows the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded. We use the term ECOG to refer to the entire range of invasive recording techniques (from subdural strips and grids to penetrating electrodes) that share the common attribute of recording neural activity from the human brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. While this ability has resulted in many high-impact advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain function in health and disease, it generates staggering amounts of data as a single patient can be implanted with hundreds of electrodes, each sampled thousands of times a second for hours or even days. The difficulty of exploring these vast datasets is the rate-limiting step in using them to improve human health. We propose to overcome this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the unique properties of ECOG. We dub this software tool RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).  The first goal of Aim 1 is to release RAVE 1.0 to the entire ECOG community by month 6 of the first funding period. This will maximize transformative impact by putting the new tools in the hands of users as quickly as possible, facilitating rapid adoption. The design philosophy of RAVE is driven by three imperatives. The first is to keep users ""close to the data"" so that users may make discoveries about the brain without being misled by artifacts. The second imperative is rigorous statistical methodology. The final imperative is ""play well with others"". As described in Aim 2, our approach will make it easy to seamlessly incorporate new and existing analysis tools written in Matlab, C++, Python or R into RAVE, giving users the best of both worlds: advanced but easy-to-use visualization of results from ECOG experiments, whether they are analyzed with the off-the- shelf tools routines provided with RAVE or novel tools developed by others.

"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three‐dimensional (3D) whole‐brain imaging of non‐transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole‐brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo‐bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide‐spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state‐of‐the‐art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large‐scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,9559081,R44MH116827,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2018,556615,0.03588234783651527
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals.

"CRCNS: Common algorithmic strategies used by the brain for labeling points in high-dimensional space The first major goal of this work is to learn how certain brain regions (olfactory system,  hippocampus, and cerebellum) learn very complex stimuli that employ a combinatorial code to  identify stimuli as points in a high-dimensional space. For example, the simple fruit fly  olfactory system uses the firing rates of 50 different types of odorant receptors to  identify each odor by placing it at a point in a SO-dimensional space. Although the fly olfactory  system is well understood, less is known about analogous regions in vertebrate brains, and our  goal is to begin to learn about these other regions. The first step is to start with the mouse olfactory system that is similar to the fly in some ways but has complexities that are  absent in insects. These complexities include an enhanced ability to handle noise in the  odor and to learn over time to discriminate between very similar odors (e.g., two types of  red wines). Preliminary evidence shows that it should be possible to learn the role of  these complexities in vertebrate olfaction. The research design involves studying the  anatomy and recording the firing rates of different types of neurons at different levels of the  mouse olfactory system and in applying computational methods and algorithms that have  proved successful in earlier work to describe these complexities. The second major goal is to use insights into how these brain regions operate to improve the  function of computer algorithms. For a long time, a dream of many neuroscientists and computer  scientists has been to understand how the brain works well enough that we could translate insights  from the brain to improve machine computation. Indeed, experience has shown that the brain   has evolved novel variations of information processing algorithms used by computer  scientists to solve general computational problems. With sufficient insight into algorithms  used by the brain, these insights may provide unexpected ways to improve the function computer  science algorithms. Further, understanding the circuit mechanisms involved in olfactory processing can help illuminate the basis of a variety of smell disorders, and may  in the future lead to the construction of artificial smelling devices. Our main goal is to understand what computations are used by the mammalian olfactory system; this  has two types of public relevance. First, we hope to learn what circuit mechanisms are used in  this brain region, which may help identify how disruption of these mechanisms causes  brain and olfactory malfunction. Second, we hope to improve computer performance by using insights into how the brain computes.",CRCNS: Common algorithmic strategies used by the brain for labeling points in high-dimensional space,9692942,R01DC017695,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Burn injury', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Dreams', 'Drosophila genus', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fire - disasters', 'Fruit', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Olfaction Disorders', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'combinatorial', 'computer science', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learning community', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'red wine', 'response', 'theories']",NIDCD,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2018,481000,0.02548449076893092
"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments.

"Longitudinal Analysis of the Dynamic Network Disruptions in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract A plethora of neuroscience studies has found that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can be understood as a dysfunction syndrome where the structural and functional connectivity of the large-scale network are progressively disrupted by molecular pathomechanism that is not fully understood. The disruptions to the network exhibit dynamic patterns at different stages of AD, which holds valuable clues to understand AD progression. Current network computational tools are designed for cross-sectional data only, which is insufficient to maintain temporal consistency in investigating longitudinal network changes. To address this problem, we will develop the first extensive computational tool for longitudinal network analysis. Specifically, we will propose a learning-based approach to precisely quantify the evolution of brain network from noisy imaging data (Aim 1). Sparse representation and tensor analysis technique will be integrated to seek for the consistent longitudinal brain networks. We will apply our longitudinal network analysis tool to the series diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from ADNI database to investigate how Alzheimer’s disease attacks human brain network by inspecting the dynamic interactions between the hub and non-hub nodes in AD progression (Aim 2). The outcome of this project will be the first longitudinal brain network analysis tool in computational neuroscience and neuroimaging fields. We will release the software (both binary program and source code), to facilitate the network studies in other neuro diseases that show brain network dysfunction. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a set of efficient computational tools specifically for longitudinal brain network analysis. In order to accurately measure the connectivity strength, we propose a learning-based approach to find the intrinsic brain network from the noisy imaging data. Sparse representation and tensor analysis technique have been integrated into brain network optimization for preserving the longitudinal consistency. It is worth noting that our data-driven approach is free of the ad-hoc thresholding technique which may undermine the repeatability of discovery. To the best of our knowledge, our learning-based approach is the first extensive computational tool for longitudinal network analysis in neuroscience and neuroimaging field. We will apply our longitudinal network analysis tools to the series diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from ADNI database to investigate how Alzheimer’s disease attacks human brain network by inspecting the dynamic interactions between hub and non-hub nodes in AD progression. At the end of this project, we will release the software (both binary program and source code), to facilitate the network studies in other neuro diseases which are related to brain network dysfunction.",Longitudinal Analysis of the Dynamic Network Disruptions in Alzheimer's Disease,9508126,R21AG059065,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mental state', 'network dysfunction', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'potential biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2018,233250,-0.06505912507296856
"Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis Project Summary: Brain networks linking the cortex to thalamus are critical for cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning. Dysruption of thalamocortical networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychosis, and mechanisms of clinical phenotypes, especially cognitive impairment. This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks. The availability of several large-scale cross-sectional datasets containing multi-modal neuroimaging data and extensive phenotypic data on healthy and at-risk individuals has created an unprecedented opportunity to address these critical knowledge gaps. They include the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN: n=656, ages 18-88); Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI- RS: n=932, ages 6-85); Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset (PING: N=1239, ages 3-20); Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC: n=1601, ages 8-21), which includes psychosis spectrum (PS) youth; and the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS: n=397). Building on our prior work in clinical populations and leveraging the considerable resources of these datasets, we propose to chart the development of thalamocortical networks in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and youth with PS symptoms (Aim 2), characterize the associations between thalamocortical biomarkers and cognition (Aim 3), and investigate the clinical utility of thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers at identifying atypical brain development in individual subjects across the psychosis continuum and predicting conversion to psychosis in clinical high risk individuals (Aim 4). The proposed Aims will: 1) establish critical normative lifespan development data for refining and testing etiological models of not just psychosis, but other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as aging- related disorders; 2) inform the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders and contribute to dimensional models of psychosis; 3) help define the neural basis of executive cognitive abilities thereby providing the necessary foundation for mechanistic models of normal cognitive function and cognitive impairment in psychosis; and 4) potentially provide risk biomarkers and intervention targets for youth at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Public Health Relevance: Many psychiatric disorders emerge between childhood and early adulthood, a period when the brain is undergoing significant developmental changes, and are associated with cognitive impairment which leads to lifelong limitations in psychosocial functioning. Determining how and when premorbid brain development goes awry, clarifying the neural basis of cognitive impairment, and establishing the clinical utility of brain-based biomarkers at predicting illness onset in individuals at high risk for neuropsychiatric illness are essential to developing targeted interventions that prevent the onset of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.",Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis,9593608,R01MH115000,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'symptomatology', 'young adult']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,447624,-0.00956132461036998
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9501776,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,483815,0.03097195286334777
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder(MDD), bipolar disorders(BD) and schizophrenia(SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason lies in that most neuroimaging “prediction” studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple “correlation” relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, or lack of multi-site validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with references, and sparse regression etc. can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, which can be promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers, which goes beyond a more descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain diseases. We will develop 3 novel data- driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment(in SZ) or epigenetic factors (miR-132 dysregulation in MDD) may affect covarying brain function and structure, which uses different clinical measures as reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction model that is able to identify imaging biomarkers for precise, individualized prediction of clinical outcomes, e.g., remission status of MDD patients after Electroconvulsive Treatment(ECT). 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep neural networks(DNN) combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), to classify multiple group of psychiatric disorders by using functional connectivity measures, and to trace back the most predictive functional networks from the black box of deep learning by LRP. All above proposed methods will be applied to the big data containing multimodal imaging and behavioral information(n=5000) pooled from existing studies, to investigate biomarkers that can help solve specific clinical difficulties. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, lead to earlier and more effective interventions, suggesting a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep neural networks, supervised learning and dynamic functional information, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, thus identify replicable and precise biomarkers that are able to predict individual clinical measures and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting a large imaging and behavioral dataset (n~5000) to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9733448,R56MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'CREB1 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R56,2018,453304,0.004277022136959792
"Statistical Methods for Multilevel Multivariate Functional Studies Abstract  While imaging studies are widely used in clinical practice and research, the number of neuroimaging- based biomarkers is small. For example, in clinical trials of immunomodulatory therapies for MS, the only commonly used imaging biomarkers are the total lesion volume and the number of new and en- hancing lesions. These biomarkers are essential, but do not capture the recovery process of lesions, which is thought to decline in more severe, progressive disease. The partial or complete recovery of lesions may depend both on the ability of the brain to heal and on external factors, such as treat- ment or environmental and behavioral exposures. In this proposal we take the natural next step of proposing imaging biomarkers for MS based on the formation and change of lesions as observed on multi-sequence structural MRIs. To solve this problem we propose to address several general method- ological problems: 1) develop models and methods for the longitudinal analysis of several images of the same brain; 2) identify and estimate the length of history that is necessary to estimate recovery; 3) study the association with known biomarkers of the disease (in this case total volume and number of new and enhancing lesions); 4) develop methods that are robust to changes in imaging protocols that inevitably arise in longitudinal neuroimaging studies; and 5) develop the computational tools that allow for sophisticated methods to be implemented seamlessly in practice. While our scientiﬁc problem is focused, the proposed statistical methods are general and can be applied to a wide variety of longitu- dinal neuroimaging studies. For example, there are many ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging studies, including the ADNI, AIBL, HBC, and MISTIE, where our methods could be used to study subtle or large changes in lesions or in white and gray matter intensities. Project narrative. The project provides statistical analysis methods for quantiﬁcation of the evolution in the intensity of brain lesions on multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Methods are motivated by the need to develop new neuroimaging-based biomarkers for multiple sclerosis (MS), but can be applied to other types of brain diseases including stroke, Alzheimer disease, and cancer.",Statistical Methods for Multilevel Multivariate Functional Studies,9492705,R01NS060910,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Names', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'biomarker validation', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'gray matter', 'healing', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal database', 'neuroimaging', 'non-Gaussian model', 'personalized approach', 'repaired', 'software development', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,637414,-0.03411182369050615
"Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and difﬁculties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speciﬁc brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speciﬁc behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ﬁrst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ﬁnding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care. A primary goal of this project is to create open-source software that is used by the neuroscience community to advance research in understanding the brain basis of behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders. Project Narrative This grant is focused on developing novel analysis of complex brain networks from structural and functional imaging and using this to link brain features to behavioral phenotypes. These algorithms will be used to discover brain biomarkers of behavioral traits in Autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders.","Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes",9546678,R01EB022876,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Phenotype', 'Population Control', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain shape', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'individual variation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'social', 'trait']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,381250,-0.017099867223593936
"Laboratory of Neuro Imaging Resource (LONIR) PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL The LONIR is focused on developing innovative solutions for the investigation of imaging, genetics, behavioral and clinical data. The LONIR structure is designed to facilitate studies of dynamically changing anatomic frameworks, e.g., developmental, neurodegenerative, traumatic, and metastatic, by providing methods for the comprehensive understanding of the nature and extent of these processes. Specifically, TR&D1 (Data Science) focuses on methodological developments for the management and informatics of brain and related data. This project will develop and issue new methods for robust scientific data management to create an environment where scientific analyses can be reproduced and/or enhanced, data can be easily discovered and reused, and analysis results can be visualized and made publicly searchable. TR&D2 (Diffusion MRI and Connectomics) seeks to advance the study of brain connectivity using diffusion imaging and its powerful extensions. This project will go beyond traditional tensor models of diffusion for assessing tissue and fiber microstructure and connectivity, develop tract-based statistical analysis tools using Deep Learning, introduce novel adaptive connectivity mapping approaches, using L1 fusion of multiple tractography methods, and provide mechanisms to study connectivity and diffusion imaging over 10,000 subjects. (This technology and these methods will be managed and executed by the TR&D1 framework to distributed datasets totaling over 10,000 subjects). Lastly, our TR&D3 (Intrinsic Surface Mapping) develops a general framework for surface mapping in the high dimensional Laplace-Beltrami embedding space via the mathematical optimization of their Riemannian metric. Our approach here overcomes fundamental limitations in existing methods based on spherical registration by eliminating the metric distortion during the parameterization step, thus achieving much improved accuracy in mapping brain anatomy. Coupled with a mature and efficient administrative structure and comprehensive training and dissemination, this program serves a wide and important need in the scientific community.

"Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning Abstract Classically, anatomic information provided by MRI has been essential to the neurosurgeon to maximize extent of tumor resection and, as a result, improve survival statistics. That said, it is not routine during resections to make use of similar imaging information that reflect the functional organization of the brain. Task-based fMRI has been employed as a means of pre-operatively localizing function. However, task-based fMRI depends on the patient’s ability to comply with the task paradigm, which frequently is lacking. This problem can be overcome by using the recently developed method of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to localize function. Moreover, rsfMRI is highly efficient, as multiple resting state networks (RSNs) associated with multiple cognitive domains can be mapped at the same time. With this in mind, the long-term goal of our research is to improve survival and quality of life after surgical resection of brain tumors by improving the identification/preservation of eloquent cortex. The current barrier that prevents the widespread use of rsfMRI is 1) the high degree of advanced imaging expertise currently necessary to create and interpret the images and 2) the necessary IT infrastructure necessary to support the analyses. To address this shortcoming, we propose to create a turnkey system for functional mapping within the brain that resides on a cloud-computing platform. At the heart of our methodology is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm that assigns RSN membership to each locus within the brain using supervised classification of rsfMRI data. Current data demonstrate that MLP-based RSN mapping is more reliable than conventional task-based fMRI and is extremely sensitive to sites identified by cortical stimulation (the standard in intraoperative mapping). Translation of the science and techniques created at Washington University will be accomplished by a deep collaboration with Radiologics, an emerging company with strong expertise in cloud computing for clinical imaging. Towards this end, the overall objective of the proposed project is to create an imaging technology package, named Cirrus, that will integrate automatic MLP-based RSN mapping with cloud-based computing. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to 1) Create Cloud-Based rsfMRI Brain Mapping Capability - Cirrus, 2) Deploy Cloud-Based rsfMRI Capability (Cirrus Platform) to New User Host Institutions, and 3) Optimize the Clinical User Interface (UI) of Cirrus. The expected outcome of this translational strategy will be an integrated imaging/surgical presurgical mapping technology using rsfMRI with clearly defined performance capabilities, well delineated localization outputs, and a clinician friendly user experience that scales to all types of health care settings. Thus, this proposal is innovative because there currently does not exist any comparable system that integrates cutting edge image analysis tools with cloud-based capabilities. This work is significant because it will disseminate technology that fundamentally enhances the surgeon’s understanding of the functional implications of their surgical strategy, thereby enables safer, more tailored approaches to improving outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research is an academic industry partnership that will make available, to any neurosurgical practice advanced functional MRI methodology to define critical regions in the brain. This development is relevant to public health because it has the potential to improve functional outcomes following surgical removal of brain tumors. Towards this end, we propose to create an imaging technology package that will integrate 1) advanced machine learning techniques using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and 2) cloud-based computing, to perform advanced brain mapping. Thus, advanced functional localization can be standardized and acquired at any institution by being uniformly processed in the cloud and sent back to the home institution without the need for costly infrastructure. The integrated package will enable clinicians in any practice environment to efficiently and reliably visualize function on the brain’s anatomy prior to surgery.",Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning,9552903,R44GM125438,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Glioma', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Rest', 'Science', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stress Tests', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tumor resection', 'clinical imaging', 'cloud based', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'health care settings', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'statistics', 'tool', 'translational approach', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,"RADIOLOGICS, INC.",R44,2018,740001,-0.010344135778570747
"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn. The goal of this research is to create mathematical models that can predict measureable health consequences from manganese exposure using medical imaging and individual exposure data.",Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity,9494372,F31ES028081,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurotoxins', 'Normalcy', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Poison', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Structure of nail of toe', 'Symptoms', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Welding', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'air sampling', 'base', 'cohort', 'exposed human population', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'outcome prediction', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'screening', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,0.026547732845642182
"Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This lack of progress is reflected in the continued excessive direct and indirect health care expenditure related to these conditions, largely in form of unnecessary diagnostic procedures to rule out ""organic"" disease and lack of novel, cost effective therapies. During the past funding cycle, we have identified functional alterations of brain networks in IBS patients, both in the resting state and in response to physical and psychological stimuli, which are related to sex, gene polymorphisms and a history of early adverse life events. These functional findings were accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of both white and grey matter in the brain of IBS patients resulting in a distinct ""brai signature"". In this revised competitive renewal application, I plan to take these insights to the next level by validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IB patients from healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome. Using an array of advanced, innovative brain imaging, genomic and microbiological techniques, I will address these goals in 3 Specific Aims: A. Identify disease- specific brain signatures of IBS, identify correlations of these signatures with behavioral and clinical parameters, and determine accuracy to predict IBS phenotype compared to HCs, and patients with chronic gut inflammation (ulcerative colitis). B. Identify gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and correlate with distinct brain signatures in IBS patients as identified in Aim A. C. Identify gut microbiome derived metabolites which correlate with brain signatures in IBS patients. The longitudinal design of the study combined with a mediator/moderator analysis approach will enable us to infer causality between brain, peripheral factors and symptoms, and will provide the basis for future mechanistic studies in animal models. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to improve our understanding of the complex bidirectional brain gut interactions of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS and identify biomarkers in order to develop more effective treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 15% of the U.S. population and leads to a substantial economic and societal burden. Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for IBS. This proposal is relevant to public health in that it is aimed at validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IBS patients fro healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome to provide the basis for mechanistic studies, advance our knowledge of IBS pathophysiology and aid future development of IBS therapies.",Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation,9529636,R01DK048351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feces', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Metadata', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visceral', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disorder control', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'monocyte', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'pain sensitivity', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,576642,0.01269887914085979
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cognitive control is implicated in a number of higher-order cognitive abilities, including the allocation and maintenance of attention, task switching and response selection. Individual ability to engage these functions is variable, and deficits in these areas can lead to significantly diminished quality of life. Repetitive head impacts (RHI) are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by aberrant tau protein deposition that currently can only be diagnosed at autopsy. Individuals at risk for and later diagnosed with CTE often display deficits of cognitive control that are observable behaviorally and via neurocognitive tests (NCT). Participants in high impact sports (e.g., American football, boxing, rugby) and military service-members often experience a large number of repetitive head impacts (RHI). The current lack of in vivo biomarkers to evaluate the long-term effects of RHI severely impacts the ability of researchers and clinicians to monitor at risk individuals for the development and progression of CTE. The research proposed herein aims to characterize the link between cognitive control network function, normal and abnormal functional network connectivity and NCT performance, and whether this is predictive of exposure to RHI. The proposed methods and hypotheses within this research proposal also provide a valuable training opportunity.  Preliminary results from our laboratory demonstrate that a subject's functional connectivity fingerprint can predict individual task fMRI activation. Furthermore, preliminary results in a dataset of retired NFL players indicate aberrant functional connectivity within the dorsal attention and cognitive control networks. The proposed series of studies will employ functional MRI (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity (RSFC), and NCT to: 1) examine the relationship between cognitive control and attention fMRI activation, network RSFC and the effect of RHI exposure; and 2) investigate the relationship between fMRI, functional connectivity and diminished NCT performance in a population exposed to RHI. We propose to first study a group of healthy control subjects to increase our knowledge of how the brain engages control processes in auditory and visual attention tasks, and relate this to existing, well-accepted tests of attention and cognitive control. Subsequently, we will investigate the relationship between diminished cognitive control processes and altered functional connectivity in a population exposed to RHI. Our aim is to establish the predictive power of RSFC for individual variability in the application of cognitive control processes in everyday life. Importantly, the successful completion of this study will increase our understanding of long term effects of RHI on the brain's connectivity and begin to formulate clinical profiles that may be used in the diagnosis and staging of CTE in vivo PROJECT NARRATIVE Repetitive head impacts are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairments in cognitive control processes. This research proposes to characterize the link between normal and altered brain connectivity in participants exposed to a high degree of repetitive head impacts, i.e., retired NFL and college football players and findings from this work will increase our understanding of how brain networks facilitate cognitive control processes. In addition, by developing a clinical profile of disrupted brain connectivity related to repetitive head impacts, this research may also improve our ability to diagnose and track those at risk for developing of CTE.",Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact,9507688,F31NS103306,"['Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Boxing', 'Brain', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manufactured football', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rugbies', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Sports', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Tauopathies', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'chronic traumatic encephalopathy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'head impact', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'infancy', 'multisensory', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'service member', 'social norm', 'specific biomarkers', 'support network', 'tau Proteins', 'training opportunity']",NINDS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),F31,2018,28735,0.0003663807349075098
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9568765,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multitask', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'premature neonates', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,392718,-0.010297632989593413
"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9456759,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'adult obesity', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'collaborative environment', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'immunoregulation', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2018,202835,0.033671486339016767
"Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Abstract: The increasing availability of infant brain MR images, such as those that will be collected through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP, on which Dr. Shen is a Co-PI, focusing on data acquisition), affords unprecedented opportunities for precise charting of dynamic early brain developmental trajectories in understanding normative and aberrant growth. However, to fully benefit from these datasets, a major barrier that needs to be overcome is the critical lacking of computational tools for accurate processing and analysis of infant MRI data, which typically exhibit poor tissue contrast, large within tissue intensity variation, and regionally-heterogeneous and dynamic changes. To fill this critical gap, in 2012 we pioneered in creating an infant-centric MRI processing software package, called infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Tool (iBEAT), and a set of infant-specific atlases, called UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases, and further made them freely and publicly available via NITRC. Over the last 4 years, iBEAT and UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases have been downloaded 2900+ and 5600+ times, respectively, and contributed to 160+ independent research papers. As indicated by 30+ support letters, iBEAT is now driving the research for MRI studies of early brain development in many labs throughout the world. Results produced by iBEAT are also highlighted in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT, by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. To achieve this goal, we propose four aims. In Aim 1, we will create an innovative learning-based multi-source information integration framework for joint skull stripping and tissue segmentation for accurate structural measurements. Our method employs random forest to adaptively learn the optimal image appearance features from multimodality images and also informative context features from tissue probability maps. In Aim 2, we will construct longitudinal infant brain atlases at multiple time points (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age) for both T1-/T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR images. We propose a longitudinally-consistent sparse representation technique to construct representative atlases with significantly improved structural details by explicitly dealing with possible misalignments between images even after registration. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel learning-based approach for cortical topology correction and integrate it, along with our infant-centric analysis tools and atlases for cortical surfaces, into iBEAT for precise mapping of dynamic and complex cortical changes in infants. Unlike existing tools that perform poorly for infant brains, we will incorporate infant-dedicated tools for topology correction, surface reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and measurements. We will further integrate longitudinal infant cortical surface atlases equipped with parcellations based on growth trajectories. In Aim 4, we will significantly enhance iBEAT in terms of its software functionalities as well as user support via systematic outreach and training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC. Project Narrative This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. In particular, we propose four aims: 1) Learning-Based Brain Segmentation; 2) Infant Brain Atlases in the First Year of Life; 3) Cortical Surface-Based Analysis; and 4) Enhancing User Experience and Training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC.",Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools,9613643,R01MH117943,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education and Outreach', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'cranium', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'diffusion weighted', 'experience', 'file format', 'forest', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,466500,0.03272830702087541
"SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy Project Abstract Advances in imaging have had a profound effect on our ability to generate high-resolution measurements of the brain’s structure. One of the major hurdles in processing modern neuroimaging datasets designed to produce large-scale maps of the connections and the organization of the brain lies in the sheer size of these data. For instance, electron microscopic (EM) images of a cubic millimeter of cortex occupies roughly 3 PBon disk, and lower resolution emerging X-ray microtomography (XRM) data can exceed 10 TB for a single mouse brain. When dealing with datasets of this size, the application of even simple algorithms becomes difficult. The size of datasets also exacerbates the considerable challenges for dissemination, reproducibility, and collaboration across laboratories. Addressing these challenges requires a new approach that leverages state-of-the-art computer science technology while remaining conscientious of the underlying bioinformatics. We propose Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research (SABER), a user-friendly and portable framework that automates the retrieval, extraction, and analysis of large-scale imagery data to facilitate neuroscientific analyses. SABER aims to improve the reliability and reproducibility of neuroimagery research by providing a common substrate upon which algorithms may be developed. Leveraging SABER’s containers — a standardized packaging for software — this substrate can then be trivially transferred to other machines by the same researcher or by other teams aiming to reproduce or adapt the prior work, making sharing workflows and extracting knowledge commonplace. Using SABER will ensure that the analysis runs identically, regardless of by whom or where the workflow is executed. Because developing and deploying these analysis solutions for large image volumes are acute barriers to developing consistently reproducible workflows, SABER will further the neuroscientific analysis community by simplifying the workflow-development and workflow-execution steps. To demonstrate this, we plan to distribute two community-vetted, optimized workflows to convert large-scale EM and XRM volumetric imagery into maps of neuronal connectivity. Many neurological diseases are characterized by their impact on the density of cells and vessels, neuron death, connectivity, or other factors that are visible with imaging technologies. SABER will provide a framework for producing reproducible estimates of cell counts, vasculature density, and connectomes, thus enabling increased understanding of the impact of disease on the neuroanatomy of many brains. This work will enable the development of tools that can both be applied to massive data and shared amongst many scientists, which will in turn accelerate progress and neuroscientific discovery. Project Narrative: Our Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory team leverages prior neuroscience analysis experience to present SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research — a portable, easy-to-install framework that enables large-scale neuroanatomical data processing by providing a scaffold upon which highly-reproducible bioinformatics protocols may be built. To support emerging efforts to understand the biological basis of disease, we demonstrate turn-key pipelines to translate multi-terabyte electron microscopy and X-ray microtomography data volumes into maps of neuronal connectivity.",SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy,9568023,R24MH114799,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Arm', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Density', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Grant', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Physics', 'Pluto', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'brain research', 'brain tissue', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'data access', 'data archive', 'data management', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'relating to nervous system', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R24,2018,386960,0.03126519626446925
"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions. The starting point of the project is our earlier discovery that phase structure in oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) of hippocampal areas CA1/CA3 carry location information in exquisite detail (Agarwal et al. 2014). We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations. The computational description level will leverage ideas of vector symbolic architectures, a class of connectionist models originally proposed for describing cognitive reasoning (Plate, 1995; Kanerva, 1996). Models produced by the software tool will concisely encapsulate assumptions about the computation and its implementation of a brain function and produce predictions that can be tested in a next generation of recording experiments. The proposed theory framework will be tested in building models for navigation in hippocampus and for visual processing in areas V1 and V4 in cortex. Project narrative: A key difficulty with inferring brain function from recordings of neural activity in a working brain is that the dynamics of individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Here we address this problem by delivering new tools for decoding and decomposing neural population activity, leveraging the recent discovery by the PI of behavior-specific phase structure of local field potentials. Further, we provide software and a theoretical framework for describing models of brain function on a computational and mechanistic level that can produce testable predictions for a new generation of brain recording experiments.",Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings,9615743,R01EB026955,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Encapsulated', 'Fostering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'area V1', 'area V4', 'base', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'independent component analysis', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'presynaptic', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'visual processing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,21212,0.011199015237452564
"Towards integrated 3D reconstruction of whole human brains at subcellular resolution Project Summary A detailed understanding of the anatomical and molecular architectures of brain cells and their brain-wide organization is essential for interrogating human brain function and dysfunction. Extensive efforts have been made toward mapping brain cells through various lenses, which have established invaluable databases yielding new insights. However, integrative extraction of the multimodal properties of various cell-types brain-wide within the same brain, crucial to elucidating complex intercellular relationships, remains nearly impossible. We have developed high-throughput, cost-effective technology platforms to create a fully integrated three-dimensional (3D) human brain cell atlas by simultaneously mapping high-dimensional features (e.g., spatial, molecular, morphological, and microenvironment information) of all cells acquired from the same whole brain. The proposed work will establish the most comprehensive 3D human brain map to date, with unprecedented resolution and completeness. We envision that this atlas will facilitate the integration of a broad range of studies and allow the research community to interrogate human brain structure and function at multiple levels. In Aim 1, we will apply a novel technology to transform whole human brain tissue into indestructible hydrogel–tissue hybrids that allow highly multiplexed molecular labeling and subcellular-resolution volume imaging. In Aim 2, we will apply scalable labeling and imaging technologies to map the brain-wide 3D distribution of various cell-type and structural markers at subcellular resolution within the same brain. Our chemical engineering–based approach to this aim will enable cost-effective, lossless 3D labeling of the entire human brain at lower cost as traditional subsampling approaches. True volume labeling and subcellular-resolution imaging will allow us to extract fine morphological and connectivity information from labeled cells and reconstruct the microenvironment of all cells. In Aim 3, we will use a host of rapid and highly automated algorithms to perform unbiased, integrative high- dimensional phenotyping of all cells based on their spatial location, molecular expression, morphology, and microenvironment. In Aim 4, we will perform super-resolution phenotyping of cells in a selected brain region from the same sample used in Aim 3 to map inter-areal axonal connectivity at single-fiber resolution and to characterize chemical synapses. This integrative approach will likely unveil unique cell-types and brain regions, a crucial step toward a better understanding of brain function. The complete 3D dataset will be linked to magnetic resonance and diffusion spectrum images and existing reference atlases to facilitate the integration of a wide breadth of study at multiple levels and to make the data publicly accessible for mining and analysis. A detailed picture of the human brain’s complex intermolecular, intercellular, and interareal interactions is of paramount importance for understanding its function and dysfunction. However, the immense complexity of the human brain and the absence of enabling technologies have hither-to made it impossible to interrogate these interactions brain-wide.

"Enabling Shared Analysis and Processing of Large Neurophysiology Data Project Summary / Abstract Understanding brain function is key to improving health care and advancing a number of scientific initiatives. The treatment of degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and ALS is becoming increasingly important as the current US population ages and life expectancies increase. The costs of Alzheimer's and other dementias is estimated at over $200 billion in 2016 alone, not to mention the human devastation that these diseases incur. Autism, addiction, depression, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and pain treatment are just a few more of the critically important health concerns related to brain function. Cognitive science is also at the forefront of research into computational and autonomous systems, with the potential to revolutionize human computer interaction and tackle emerging global challenges. As a result of these and other significant opportunities the BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Presidential initiative was created to improve the future health and competitiveness of the nation, with the fundamental goal of accelerating brain research. Consistent with this goal, the brain research community has developed the Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB) file format and specification to support large-scale collaboration and research. This open format was created in 2014 and is already making an impact on cellular-based neurophysiology, with organizations such as the Allen Institute for Brain Science generating and sharing datasets such as the Allen Brain Observatory and the Allen Cell Types Database. Although this preliminary work is promising, progress in the research community is slowed by a lack of software tools to readily browse, process, analyse, and visualize NWB data, while promoting replicability. Thus this work aims to to produce such tools in support of the BRAIN initiative and other large-scale brain research programs by supporting and growing the NWB community. The work proposed here addresses three important workflows in cellular-based neurophysiology: o​ ptical physiology to image neurons under stimuli, silicon probe recordings to detect spike events from the surface of the cortex down through deeps​ structures, and​ in vitro slice electrophysiology to record t​ ime-varying stimulus and electrical response from a neuron​. Novel multiscale software tools will be created to enable efficient browsing, processing, analysis, and visualization of NWB-based brain data; linking experimental stimuli to observed responses. Conversion utilities will also be developed to convert existing data into NWB form. As the data is large, complex, and may be distributed across many sites, the software tools will be web-based, enabling researchers to remotely access and process data in a reproducible manner, and to use scalable cloud computing resources. The software will be released under open source licences and will be placed under formal software process to facilitate sharing across the research community. The tools will be conceived and created with the help of Allen scientists, who will also perform final validation using these three workflows.

"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9307803,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,549838,0.045470830380726246
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9272937,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2017,186993,0.037498827503311495
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9213309,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'serial imaging', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,451650,0.0016114495582846143
"Deep Learning for Connectomics Project Summary/Abstract The brain contains a vast number of neurons that are connected with each other through synapses, thereby forming a complex anatomical network that mediates information ﬂow within the brain. The brain “wiring diagram” will be a foundational tool for elucidating the function and dysfunction of brains. Electron microscopy (EM) is widely considered to be the gold standard for neuronal level circuit recon- struction. Currently, a major and serious bottleneck in this ﬁeld is image segmentation and reconstruc- tion. It is estimated that the data analysis accuracy and throughput are lagging behind data acquisition by orders of magnitude. This project aims at dramatically improving the accuracy and throughput of brain EM image analysis, thereby enabling accurate and efﬁcient reconstruction of neuronal level brain maps. Speciﬁcally, this project is built up on the recent success in deep learning methods, which are dominant tools for EM image analysis. A central and unresolved challenge of using deep learning for segmentation is how to achieve the conﬂicting goals of integrating sufﬁcient contextual features while preserving full-resolution information. This project will develop a novel residual encoder-decoder model to achieve these two goals simultaneously (Aim 1). In current deep learning segmentation methods, the labels of each pixel are predicted independently. To fully consider the brain topological structure and couple the predictions of spatially adjacent pixels, this project will develop a hybrid recurrent and convo- lutional network model (Aim 2). In this model, the recurrent network is integrated with the convolutional network to incorporate the multi-dimensional structural information. When combined with Aim 1, these methods are expected to dramatically improve the accuracy of EM image segmentation. In most cur- rent deep learning segmentation methods, the training and/or prediction stages require the extraction of patches centered on each pixel. This step forms a bottleneck that limits the overall throughput. This project will develop novel techniques to achieve whole-image training and prediction (Aim 3). These approaches will enable very efﬁcient training and segmentation, thereby dramatically increasing the throughput of EM image analysis. Project narrative Wiring diagrams of the brain circuits serve as a foundational tool for studying brain function and dys- function. This project aims at developing advanced computational methods for boosting the accuracy and throughput of brain circuit reconstruction from electron microscopy images.

"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate recent advances in MR imaging of MTBI with clinically important information using advanced machine-learning computational algorithms to identify the most clinically relevant features, thus allowing us to distinguish patients from controls and to predict clinical outcome. If successful, this research will provide an objective tool for classification and outcome prediction in MTBI and will be a critical advance in both the clinical and research arenas in the study of traumatic brain injury.",Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury,9295067,R21NS090349,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Common Data Element', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Eye', 'FarGo', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iron', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disability', 'drug development', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'magnetic field', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood regulation', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2017,198365,-2.2100301808787917e-05
"Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities PROJECT SUMMARY  Establishing the incremental predictive validity of neuroimaging is a critical prerequisite for this technology's clinical or educational use outside of medical settings. If specific, well-validated neuroimaging tools provide little to no information above that of clinical interview or neuropsychological assessment, the use and funding of those tools should be more critically evaluated against other methods or funding priorities. If neuroimaging demonstrates unique predictive power for assessment or prediction purposes, however, it may aid in the identification of concerning developmental trajectories, the provision of early intervention, or the prediction of individuals' response to specific interventions. Preliminary data from the applicant's laboratory has demonstrated unique contributions of structural neuroimaging to individual differences in reading and attention using confirmatory structural equation modeling, but these questions have yet to be addressed using a data- driven feature-reduction approach that considers numerous types of demographic, behavioral, and brain- derived measures. This proposal focuses explicitly on structural neuroimaging as it is more easily and more consistently obtained than functional imaging in clinical and research environments, and recent findings indicate that it may even be more highly predictive of behavior than functional imaging. In light of these considerations, this proposal will utilize supervised machine learning to assess the incremental validity of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment.  The goals are this project are to (1) develop and evaluate demographic- and behavior-based predictive models of individuals' reading, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity, (2) replicate and then add neuroanatomical features to these models in order to test structural neuroimaging's incremental predictive validity, and (3) test these models' specificity and discriminant validity for measuring the intended constructs. The long-term goal of this proposal is thus to expand upon the applicant's background in individual difference analyses by developing skills in machine learning so that the incremental validity of multiple neuroimaging modalities can eventually be evaluated. The eventual development of a sufficiently validated predictive model could constitute a behavioral and/or brain-based signature that could serve, along with contextual and functional considerations, as a quantifiable alternative to clinically-based diagnoses. These methods are but first steps toward this distant but worthwhile goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite decades of studies clarifying the cognitive and neurophysiological predictors of reading and attentional abilities, we're only marginally closer to a more meaningful science of individual prediction. The proposed study will utilize machine learning techniques to test the predictive power of structural neuroimaging above and beyond that of traditional psychological assessment. Beyond the potential for improved prediction of individuals' reading and attentional abilities, the models developed can be easily improved upon using new and preexisting data, thereby moving our field closer to an individualized science of performance- and brain-based markers that can improve early risk identification and evaluate intervention targets.",Testing the Predictive Power of Structural Neuroimaging in the Estimation of Individuals' Reading and Attentional Abilities,9327290,F31HD091967,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohols', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Distant', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'demographics', 'falls', 'improved', 'inattention', 'insight', 'mathematical ability', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'phonological awareness', 'predictive modeling', 'processing speed', 'psychologic', 'reading ability', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'tractography']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,F31,2017,35797,0.03014880017909794
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project.

"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9419223,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'screening', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,223908,0.016344071794873585
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9240674,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'source localization']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2017,531286,0.02249813947802743
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9405530,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2017,680002,0.04823505876450915
"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Integrating human connectomics and brain imaging genomics offers enormous potential, allowing us to perform systems biology approaches of the brain to better understand the interplay between genes, brain connectivity, and phenotypic outcomes (e.g., cognition, behavior, disorder). This proposal seeks to develop novel bioinformatics methods and software tools for integrative study of human connectomics and brain imaging genomics. These methods and tools can be applied to: (1) study normal brain functions to impact biomedical research in general, and (2) study brain disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics,9324260,R01EB022574,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'base', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'functional outcomes', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning outcome', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phenotypic data', 'public health relevance', 'software systems', 'tool', 'tractography', 'trait', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NIBIB,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2017,101908,0.05251883755190112
"Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques Project Summary / Abstract  Neuroimaging methodologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (s/fMRI) have emerged as significant predictors of substance use relapse. These neuroimaging techniques have helped provide an objective, sensitive, and predictive measure of substance use relapse propensity. As the capabilities of biological science advance, a lingering impediment to progress is the study of individual brain regions implicated in predicting substance use relapse. Important to note, individual brain regions rarely work independently; rather, such regions often work in concert, as specific networks, continually sending and receiving information to other regions, to help facilitate learning, memory, and other cognitive processes. The investigation of ICA-derived functional network connectivity between brain regions may lend incremental utility for classifying, diagnosing, and predicting substance use relapse.  Here, using the world’s largest forensic database, which includes clinical and neuropsychological measures, electrophysiological measures, functional neuroimaging, and functional network connectivity measures, the primary goal of this project will be to delineate specific risk factors predictive of eventual stimulant use relapse propensity. This will be accomplished by integrating models incorporating logistic and Cox proportional-hazard regressions, and cross-validation machine learning pattern classifiers to predict stimulant use relapse one year after institutional release with an at-risk sample of adult incarcerated offenders.  First, we will examine the potential of various clinical and neuropsychological assessment measures in predicting stimulant use relapse. Second, we will investigate the predictive utility of error-monitoring neural measures using traditional ERPs and fMRI in predicting stimulant use relapse. Third, we will apply more agnostic, data-driven methods, including ICA-derived functional network connectivity analyses of fMRI data to measure functional connectivity between brain regions involved in error-processing to predict stimulant use relapse. Ultimately, this research will lend incremental utility in the successful prediction of stimulant use relapse, providing a more sensitive and predictive measure compared to previous investigations. The ultimate goal of the proposed training fellowship is to help provide a more biologically informed taxonomy of neurocognitive deficits associated with those prone to stimulant use relapse. Project Narrative  Prevalence estimates indicate that roughly half of incarcerated offenders meet criteria for previous history of substance use disorders (SUDs) (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2015), with a majority (66.7%) relapsing within three years of institutional release (Langan & Levin, 2002). Identifying specific risk factors, including neurocognitive measures involved in predicting stimulant use relapse following release from custody could lead to important insights into this high-risk sample. The research proposed here will examine brain anatomy, function and connectivity, and psychological traits using the world's largest multi- modal database of its kind from an incarcerated sample to directly aid the development of more contemporary, scientifically-validated taxonomy of the pathophysiology related to neurocognitive deficits associated with stimulant use relapse propensity.",Predicting Stimulant Use Relapse using Neuroimaging Techniques,9394654,F31DA043328,"['Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dorsal', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Fellowship', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Imprisonment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'New Mexico', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive process', 'court', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'hazard', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2017,31856,0.020798203240134955
"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and machine learning algorithms in the future.   Project Narrative The Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive) is a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects.",A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive,9413774,R24MH114788,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioconductor', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Familiarity', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Modification', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Personnel Staffing', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'cloud storage', 'complex R', 'computerized data processing', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'data resource', 'data visualization', 'database structure', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'next generation', 'online resource', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'repository', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'web site', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2017,1247018,0.04974541063229002
"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9305153,R01NS095741,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Education', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Problem behavior', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'gray matter', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'post stroke', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'segregation', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,587873,-0.06684635207429618
"Functional Dissection of Prenatal Drug Effects on the Developing Brain and Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY Despite efforts of prevention and education programs, licit and illicit drug use among pregnant women remains prevalent1. Most drugs of abuse easily cross the placenta and can alter the intricate balance among fetal neurotransmitters and receptors, which critically dictate in utero development of the brain's functional wiring system2-5. Therefore prenatal drug exposures (PDE) have long-lasting implications for brain and behavioral development since a small perturbation to the immature brain circuits may cascade into substantial deviations during long-term growth6. Existing behavioral studies provide converging evidence on the detrimental effects of PDE throughout development 1,6,7 but mechanistic studies of the brain basis of PDE remains scarce, especially during the infancy period. Nevertheless, studying the brain mechanisms of PDE during infancy is critical and urgently needed given that: 1) the infancy period immediately follows PDE insults and features the most dynamic postnatal brain development; 2) the infancy period is least confounded by postnatal environmental adversities that frequently accompany PDE; 3) identification of brain alterations associated with PDE during this stage has the best potential to guide early preventive intervention before behavioral problems onset. Our previous results8,9 demonstrated significant and widespread functional connectivity alterations in neonates prenatally exposed to cocaine and marijuana, respectively. However, three major areas need to be better delineated: 1) an overall picture of PDE effects on whole brain functional organization is lacking; 2) a more systematic delineation of the potential differential drug effects and their interactions is needed given the multi- drug exposure for most of the drug-abusing mothers; 3) the prediction power of detected neonatal functional alterations for later behavioral outcomes remains to be determined. Our long-term goal is to derive early functional-connectivity-based brain biomarkers for different PDEs that will reliably predict long-term behavioral outcomes. Our goal in this project is to derive neonate-based functional connectivity signatures for different PDEs and test their prediction power for 3-month behavioral outcomes. This project is significant because it is expected to be the first to identify drug-specific neurophenotypes for different PDEs on early brain functional and behavioral development, prior to the damaging postnatal influences that may accompany parental drug abuse. It is innovative because: 1) It will integrate resting-state brain functional connectivity and cognitive and behavioral function to quantify the potential drug-specific and drug-common effects on brain and behavior development in neonates; 2) It will apply detailed multi-level whole brain survey to discern differential drug-effect profiles and leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to better characterize their link with later behavioral outcomes. It is relevant to public health because it will provide currently unavailable knowledge of PDE effects on developing brain functional networks in neonates and inform earlier interventions that are documented to be most effective before symptom onset.

"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9316197,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Compulsive Behavior', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749730,0.0468302969197324
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9384304,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opiates', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,704051,0.047801701280088114
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9469790,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,613948,-0.0024960205926466456

(2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances.

"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9372271,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'forest', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,481714,0.012574783197467965

Limb apraxia is a common, disabling, and puzzling left-hemisphere disorder characterized by prominent deficits in activating and selecting task-appropriate tool actions. Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms and brain regions enabling such selection in the neurologically intact brain, or how these processes go awry in apraxia. In several other cognitive domains, it has been suggested that appropriate response selection occurs via biased competition—that is, the prioritization of competing incoming information to enable appropriate response selection. Capitalizing on the promise of such frameworks, we have developed a new functional-neuroanatomic model of biased competition in a specific left hemisphere Tool Use network. Called “Two Action Systems Plus” (2AS+), the model generates testable hypotheses about the major principles determining tool action selection, and their deficiencies in apraxia. Specifically, we hypothesize that 1) Competition between tool actions is influenced by the graded similarity of tool action representations, as implemented primarily by the left posterior temporal cortex (pTC), 2) The outcome of the competitive process is affected by the strength and timing of activation of tool action representations, and depends on the dynamic interplay of left pTC and the parietal lobes, 3) Outcome is further influenced by a mechanism that biases competition towards the tool action that is appropriate to goals and context, as implemented by the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and its connections with the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and 4) There are two subtypes of apraxia characterized by distinct failures in the competitive selection process: an anterior subtype characterized by inability to appropriately resolve tool action competition, and a posterior subtype reflecting weakened competition. These hypotheses will be tested using a number of complementary methods with healthy and brain-lesioned participants, including voxel-based lesion symptom mapping, resting functional connectivity, fMRI with multi-voxel pattern analyses, and eyetracking. By specifying when and how visuomotor information plays a role in tool representations, the proposed experiments promise to critically constrain “embodied” cognition theories claiming that tools automatically evoke their actions. The proposed research will also advance the theoretical understanding of tool action by anchoring relevant constructs in a cognitive-neuroanatomic model, clarify how action representations are organized and activated, and improve our understanding of the mechanisms affecting errors and re-learning in apraxia, with implications for rehabilitation. Project Narrative: Apraxia, a disorder of tool use, is a common and substantially disabling consequence of left hemisphere stroke, yet is relatively rarely studied and hence poorly understood. The proposed work will clarify the brain regions that are associated with the disorder, the task factors that may improve tool use abilities, and the ability of the damaged Tool Use system to learn after stroke. This information will serve as an important building block in the development of treatment strategies.",Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network,9336000,R01NS099061,"['Achievement', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Apraxias', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cheese', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'novel', 'response', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'visual motor']",NINDS,ALBERT EINSTEIN HEALTHCARE NETWORK,R01,2017,418122,-0.0017925637019444785
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior. We employ a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate this interaction during a variety of cognitive tasks.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,9208156,R01MH071589,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Paper', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual attention', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive task', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'motivated behavior', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'reward processing', 'theories']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2017,523129,0.011888150498367842
"Large-scale Network Modeling for Brain Dynamics: Statistical Learning and Optimization Summary The human brain is a large, well-connected, and dynamic network. Using functional MRI data, modeling how this network processes the stimulus information has yielded insight on some of the mechanisms of the brain. However, the past efforts, including ours, on using small-scale models yielded limited understanding of how the complete and dynamic neural system functions in task-related experiments. Such understanding cannot be recovered from the data without substantial and collaborative efforts on model development. Towards this goal, we formed a collaborative team from modelers to end-users, and we will develop large-scale methods for task related fMRI (tfMRI), including event-related fMRI, to model whole-brain network dynamics responding to task challenges. Using modern statistical learning principals and large-scale optimization algorithms, we will develop novel methods to model nonlinear, spatial-temporal dependence in high dimensional data of fMRI, stimuli, and behavior outcomes. We will primarily base our methods in the regularized, constrained graphical model (GM) framework, a promising multivariate framework for inferring brain connectivity that has been validated by simulation and anatomical studies. Using this framework, we will develop novel methods to investigate, at a large scale, how changes in connectivity and activation are driven by task challenges and how multiple brain pathways process stimulus information. We will perform comprehensive validation and assessment of the newly developed methods, using both simulated and multiple tfMRI data from large cohorts. Using the scale of modeling that previous approaches cannot readily address without substantial time penalties and maybe also inaccuracies, our collaborative team will also use these methods to investigate various novel questions and hypotheses concerning the neural basis for cognitive control as one of the use cases. We will also develop publicly available, open source implementations for a broad range of use in the neuroimaging community. These modeling efforts will lead to new insights on the networks of large-scale neural circuits, and provide pharmacological targets that may be overlooked using small-scale models.     PUBLIC RELEVANCE STATEMENT We propose a foundational framework for modeling whole-brain network dynamics.

"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging. The methods will be carefully evaluated via theory, simulation and data-based application evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern neuroimaging data are often Big, Complex, Noisy and Dependent. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of network estimation and mining based on neuroimaging data.

"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9296185,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,572607,0.03097195286334777
"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn. The goal of this research is to create mathematical models that can predict measureable health consequences from manganese exposure using medical imaging and individual exposure data.",Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity,9328902,F31ES028081,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurotoxins', 'Normalcy', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Poison', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Welding', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'air sampling', 'base', 'cohort', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'outcome prediction', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'screening', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,0.026547732845642182
"Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and difﬁculties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speciﬁc brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speciﬁc behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ﬁrst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ﬁnding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care. A primary goal of this project is to create open-source software that is used by the neuroscience community to advance research in understanding the brain basis of behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders. Project Narrative This grant is focused on developing novel analysis of complex brain networks from structural and functional imaging and using this to link brain features to behavioral phenotypes. These algorithms will be used to discover brain biomarkers of behavioral traits in Autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders.","Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes",9360120,R01EB022876,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Phenotype', 'Population Control', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain shape', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'social', 'trait']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2017,378750,-0.017099867223593936
"Statistical Methods for Multilevel Multivariate Functional Studies Abstract  While imaging studies are widely used in clinical practice and research, the number of neuroimaging- based biomarkers is small. For example, in clinical trials of immunomodulatory therapies for MS, the only commonly used imaging biomarkers are the total lesion volume and the number of new and en- hancing lesions. These biomarkers are essential, but do not capture the recovery process of lesions, which is thought to decline in more severe, progressive disease. The partial or complete recovery of lesions may depend both on the ability of the brain to heal and on external factors, such as treat- ment or environmental and behavioral exposures. In this proposal we take the natural next step of proposing imaging biomarkers for MS based on the formation and change of lesions as observed on multi-sequence structural MRIs. To solve this problem we propose to address several general method- ological problems: 1) develop models and methods for the longitudinal analysis of several images of the same brain; 2) identify and estimate the length of history that is necessary to estimate recovery; 3) study the association with known biomarkers of the disease (in this case total volume and number of new and enhancing lesions); 4) develop methods that are robust to changes in imaging protocols that inevitably arise in longitudinal neuroimaging studies; and 5) develop the computational tools that allow for sophisticated methods to be implemented seamlessly in practice. While our scientiﬁc problem is focused, the proposed statistical methods are general and can be applied to a wide variety of longitu- dinal neuroimaging studies.

"Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning Abstract Classically, anatomic information provided by MRI has been essential to the neurosurgeon to maximize extent of tumor resection and, as a result, improve survival statistics. That said, it is not routine during resections to make use of similar imaging information that reflect the functional organization of the brain. Task-based fMRI has been employed as a means of pre-operatively localizing function. However, task-based fMRI depends on the patient’s ability to comply with the task paradigm, which frequently is lacking. This problem can be overcome by using the recently developed method of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to localize function. Moreover, rsfMRI is highly efficient, as multiple resting state networks (RSNs) associated with multiple cognitive domains can be mapped at the same time. With this in mind, the long-term goal of our research is to improve survival and quality of life after surgical resection of brain tumors by improving the identification/preservation of eloquent cortex. The current barrier that prevents the widespread use of rsfMRI is 1) the high degree of advanced imaging expertise currently necessary to create and interpret the images and 2) the necessary IT infrastructure necessary to support the analyses. To address this shortcoming, we propose to create a turnkey system for functional mapping within the brain that resides on a cloud-computing platform. At the heart of our methodology is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm that assigns RSN membership to each locus within the brain using supervised classification of rsfMRI data. Current data demonstrate that MLP-based RSN mapping is more reliable than conventional task-based fMRI and is extremely sensitive to sites identified by cortical stimulation (the standard in intraoperative mapping). Translation of the science and techniques created at Washington University will be accomplished by a deep collaboration with Radiologics, an emerging company with strong expertise in cloud computing for clinical imaging. Towards this end, the overall objective of the proposed project is to create an imaging technology package, named Cirrus, that will integrate automatic MLP-based RSN mapping with cloud-based computing. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to 1) Create Cloud-Based rsfMRI Brain Mapping Capability - Cirrus, 2) Deploy Cloud-Based rsfMRI Capability (Cirrus Platform) to New User Host Institutions, and 3) Optimize the Clinical User Interface (UI) of Cirrus. The expected outcome of this translational strategy will be an integrated imaging/surgical presurgical mapping technology using rsfMRI with clearly defined performance capabilities, well delineated localization outputs, and a clinician friendly user experience that scales to all types of health care settings. Thus, this proposal is innovative because there currently does not exist any comparable system that integrates cutting edge image analysis tools with cloud-based capabilities. This work is significant because it will disseminate technology that fundamentally enhances the surgeon’s understanding of the functional implications of their surgical strategy, thereby enables safer, more tailored approaches to improving outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research is an academic industry partnership that will make available, to any neurosurgical practice advanced functional MRI methodology to define critical regions in the brain. This development is relevant to public health because it has the potential to improve functional outcomes following surgical removal of brain tumors. Towards this end, we propose to create an imaging technology package that will integrate 1) advanced machine learning techniques using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and 2) cloud-based computing, to perform advanced brain mapping. Thus, advanced functional localization can be standardized and acquired at any institution by being uniformly processed in the cloud and sent back to the home institution without the need for costly infrastructure. The integrated package will enable clinicians in any practice environment to efficiently and reliably visualize function on the brain’s anatomy prior to surgery.",Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning,9409171,R44GM125438,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Preservation', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Glioma', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stress Tests', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tumor resection', 'clinical imaging', 'cloud based', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'statistics', 'tool', 'translational approach', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,"RADIOLOGICS, INC.",R44,2017,749900,-0.010344135778570747
"Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This lack of progress is reflected in the continued excessive direct and indirect health care expenditure related to these conditions, largely in form of unnecessary diagnostic procedures to rule out ""organic"" disease and lack of novel, cost effective therapies. During the past funding cycle, we have identified functional alterations of brain networks in IBS patients, both in the resting state and in response to physical and psychological stimuli, which are related to sex, gene polymorphisms and a history of early adverse life events. These functional findings were accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of both white and grey matter in the brain of IBS patients resulting in a distinct ""brai signature"". In this revised competitive renewal application, I plan to take these insights to the next level by validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IB patients from healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome. Using an array of advanced, innovative brain imaging, genomic and microbiological techniques, I will address these goals in 3 Specific Aims: A. Identify disease- specific brain signatures of IBS, identify correlations of these signatures with behavioral and clinical parameters, and determine accuracy to predict IBS phenotype compared to HCs, and patients with chronic gut inflammation (ulcerative colitis). B. Identify gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and correlate with distinct brain signatures in IBS patients as identified in Aim A. C. Identify gut microbiome derived metabolites which correlate with brain signatures in IBS patients. The longitudinal design of the study combined with a mediator/moderator analysis approach will enable us to infer causality between brain, peripheral factors and symptoms, and will provide the basis for future mechanistic studies in animal models. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to improve our understanding of the complex bidirectional brain gut interactions of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS and identify biomarkers in order to develop more effective treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 15% of the U.S. population and leads to a substantial economic and societal burden. Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for IBS. This proposal is relevant to public health in that it is aimed at validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IBS patients fro healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome to provide the basis for mechanistic studies, advance our knowledge of IBS pathophysiology and aid future development of IBS therapies.",Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation,9348634,R01DK048351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Metadata', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visceral', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'monocyte', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,590821,0.01269887914085979

"Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cognitive control is implicated in a number of higher-order cognitive abilities, including the allocation and maintenance of attention, task switching and response selection. Individual ability to engage these functions is variable, and deficits in these areas can lead to significantly diminished quality of life. Repetitive head impacts (RHI) are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by aberrant tau protein deposition that currently can only be diagnosed at autopsy. Individuals at risk for and later diagnosed with CTE often display deficits of cognitive control that are observable behaviorally and via neurocognitive tests (NCT). Participants in high impact sports (e.g., American football, boxing, rugby) and military service-members often experience a large number of repetitive head impacts (RHI). The current lack of in vivo biomarkers to evaluate the long-term effects of RHI severely impacts the ability of researchers and clinicians to monitor at risk individuals for the development and progression of CTE. The research proposed herein aims to characterize the link between cognitive control network function, normal and abnormal functional network connectivity and NCT performance, and whether this is predictive of exposure to RHI. The proposed methods and hypotheses within this research proposal also provide a valuable training opportunity.  Preliminary results from our laboratory demonstrate that a subject's functional connectivity fingerprint can predict individual task fMRI activation. Furthermore, preliminary results in a dataset of retired NFL players indicate aberrant functional connectivity within the dorsal attention and cognitive control networks. The proposed series of studies will employ functional MRI (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity (RSFC), and NCT to: 1) examine the relationship between cognitive control and attention fMRI activation, network RSFC and the effect of RHI exposure; and 2) investigate the relationship between fMRI, functional connectivity and diminished NCT performance in a population exposed to RHI. We propose to first study a group of healthy control subjects to increase our knowledge of how the brain engages control processes in auditory and visual attention tasks, and relate this to existing, well-accepted tests of attention and cognitive control. Subsequently, we will investigate the relationship between diminished cognitive control processes and altered functional connectivity in a population exposed to RHI. Our aim is to establish the predictive power of RSFC for individual variability in the application of cognitive control processes in everyday life. Importantly, the successful completion of this study will increase our understanding of long term effects of RHI on the brain's connectivity and begin to formulate clinical profiles that may be used in the diagnosis and staging of CTE in vivo PROJECT NARRATIVE Repetitive head impacts are linked to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairments in cognitive control processes. This research proposes to characterize the link between normal and altered brain connectivity in participants exposed to a high degree of repetitive head impacts, i.e., retired NFL and college football players and findings from this work will increase our understanding of how brain networks facilitate cognitive control processes. In addition, by developing a clinical profile of disrupted brain connectivity related to repetitive head impacts, this research may also improve our ability to diagnose and track those at risk for developing of CTE.",Predicting Whole Brain Multi-Sensory Cognitive Control Networks: Relationship with Neuropsychological Test Performance and Repetitive Head Impact,9395139,F31NS103306,"['Age', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Boxing', 'Brain', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manufactured football', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rugbies', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Sports', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Tauopathies', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapy trial', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'chronic traumatic encephalopathy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'head impact', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'multisensory', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'performance tests', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'service member', 'social norm', 'specific biomarkers', 'support network', 'tau Proteins', 'training opportunity']",NINDS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),F31,2017,32309,0.0003663807349075098
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9397322,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multitask', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'premature neonates', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,435809,-0.010297632989593413
"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9265841,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'collaborative environment', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'immunoregulation', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2017,202512,0.033671486339016767
"SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy Project Abstract Advances in imaging have had a profound effect on our ability to generate high-resolution measurements of the brain’s structure. One of the major hurdles in processing modern neuroimaging datasets designed to produce large-scale maps of the connections and the organization of the brain lies in the sheer size of these data. For instance, electron microscopic (EM) images of a cubic millimeter of cortex occupies roughly 3 PBon disk, and lower resolution emerging X-ray microtomography (XRM) data can exceed 10 TB for a single mouse brain. When dealing with datasets of this size, the application of even simple algorithms becomes difficult. The size of datasets also exacerbates the considerable challenges for dissemination, reproducibility, and collaboration across laboratories. Addressing these challenges requires a new approach that leverages state-of-the-art computer science technology while remaining conscientious of the underlying bioinformatics. We propose Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research (SABER), a user-friendly and portable framework that automates the retrieval, extraction, and analysis of large-scale imagery data to facilitate neuroscientific analyses. SABER aims to improve the reliability and reproducibility of neuroimagery research by providing a common substrate upon which algorithms may be developed. Leveraging SABER’s containers — a standardized packaging for software — this substrate can then be trivially transferred to other machines by the same researcher or by other teams aiming to reproduce or adapt the prior work, making sharing workflows and extracting knowledge commonplace. Using SABER will ensure that the analysis runs identically, regardless of by whom or where the workflow is executed. Because developing and deploying these analysis solutions for large image volumes are acute barriers to developing consistently reproducible workflows, SABER will further the neuroscientific analysis community by simplifying the workflow-development and workflow-execution steps. To demonstrate this, we plan to distribute two community-vetted, optimized workflows to convert large-scale EM and XRM volumetric imagery into maps of neuronal connectivity. Many neurological diseases are characterized by their impact on the density of cells and vessels, neuron death, connectivity, or other factors that are visible with imaging technologies. SABER will provide a framework for producing reproducible estimates of cell counts, vasculature density, and connectomes, thus enabling increased understanding of the impact of disease on the neuroanatomy of many brains. This work will enable the development of tools that can both be applied to massive data and shared amongst many scientists, which will in turn accelerate progress and neuroscientific discovery. Project Narrative: Our Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory team leverages prior neuroscience analysis experience to present SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research — a portable, easy-to-install framework that enables large-scale neuroanatomical data processing by providing a scaffold upon which highly-reproducible bioinformatics protocols may be built. To support emerging efforts to understand the biological basis of disease, we demonstrate turn-key pipelines to translate multi-terabyte electron microscopy and X-ray microtomography data volumes into maps of neuronal connectivity.",SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy,9414126,R24MH114799,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Arm', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Density', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Grant', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Physics', 'Pluto', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'brain research', 'brain tissue', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'data access', 'data archive', 'data management', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'relating to nervous system', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R24,2017,395542,0.03126519626446925
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment.

"Enabling Shared Analysis and Processing of Large Neurophysiology Data Project Summary / Abstract Understanding brain function is key to improving health care and advancing a number of scientific initiatives. The treatment of degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and ALS is becoming increasingly important as the current US population ages and life expectancies increase. The costs of Alzheimer's and other dementias is estimated at over $200 billion in 2016 alone, not to mention the human devastation that these diseases incur. Autism, addiction, depression, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and pain treatment are just a few more of the critically important health concerns related to brain function. Cognitive science is also at the forefront of research into computational and autonomous systems, with the potential to revolutionize human computer interaction and tackle emerging global challenges. As a result of these and other significant opportunities the BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Presidential initiative was created to improve the future health and competitiveness of the nation, with the fundamental goal of accelerating brain research. Consistent with this goal, the brain research community has developed the Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB) file format and specification to support large-scale collaboration and research. This open format was created in 2014 and is already making an impact on cellular-based neurophysiology, with organizations such as the Allen Institute for Brain Science generating and sharing datasets such as the Allen Brain Observatory and the Allen Cell Types Database. Although this preliminary work is promising, progress in the research community is slowed by a lack of software tools to readily browse, process, analyse, and visualize NWB data, while promoting replicability. Thus this work aims to to produce such tools in support of the BRAIN initiative and other large-scale brain research programs by supporting and growing the NWB community. The work proposed here addresses three important workflows in cellular-based neurophysiology: o​ ptical physiology to image neurons under stimuli, silicon probe recordings to detect spike events from the surface of the cortex down through deeps​ structures, and​ in vitro slice electrophysiology to record t​ ime-varying stimulus and electrical response from a neuron​. Novel multiscale software tools will be created to enable efficient browsing, processing, analysis, and visualization of NWB-based brain data; linking experimental stimuli to observed responses. Conversion utilities will also be developed to convert existing data into NWB form. As the data is large, complex, and may be distributed across many sites, the software tools will be web-based, enabling researchers to remotely access and process data in a reproducible manner, and to use scalable cloud computing resources. The software will be released under open source licences and will be placed under formal software process to facilitate sharing across the research community. The tools will be conceived and created with the help of Allen scientists, who will also perform final validation using these three workflows. Project Narrative This research is aimed at better understanding brain function. Such knowledge may lead to improved therapies for degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and ALS; and provide new treatments for autism, addiction, depression, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and pain treatment.

"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9155330,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,491014,0.045470830380726246
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment.

The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.        ",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9108475,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2016,190952,0.037498827503311495
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9058040,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,451650,0.0016114495582846143
"Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) affects ~1.5 million persons annually in the United States with fifteen to 30% of patients suffering long-term disability after injury. We remain in the early phase of understanding this disease and one of the greatest barriers to studying the disease and developing appropriate therapy is the difficulty in diagnosis and outcome prediction. Generally, the diagnosis of MTBI relies on using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a 15-point gross measurement of eye-opening, motor and verbal response. The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) workshop in 2014 indicated that use of GCS score as a single classifier for TBI is insufficient and proposed that neuroimaging play a larger role towards the development of objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. We have specific experience in studying novel MRI techniques that show much promise in evaluating MTBI patients. The goal of the current proposal is to bring these novel MRI techniques to clinical use. We propose to combine information from objective MR imaging features with clinical information to learn the patterns that can best distinguish patients from controls and predict long-term outcome using machine learning. We will validate our tool using a separate subject cohort. Such a tool would be an extremely powerful clinical tool to identify at-risk patients for early intervention. Additionally, this research will identify the most clinically relevant MR metrics, thereby pointing the way to novel therapeutic pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a major public health problem for which there is a lack of evidence-based, quantitative and objective criteria for diagnosis and outcome prediction. The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate recent advances in MR imaging of MTBI with clinically important information using advanced machine-learning computational algorithms to identify the most clinically relevant features, thus allowing us to distinguish patients from controls and to predict clinical outcome. If successful, this research will provide an objective tool for classification and outcome prediction in MTBI and will be a critical advance in both the clinical and research arenas in the study of traumatic brain injury.",Pattern Classification Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Traumatic Brain Injury,9180408,R21NS090349,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Common Data Element', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Eye', 'FarGo', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iron', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disability', 'drug development', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'magnetic field', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood regulation', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2016,196059,-2.2100301808787917e-05
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders. Identifying coherent subpopulations within the spectrum of pathological changes would further our understanding of disease etiology, and identify subconditions that require alternative or modified interventions.",CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION,9102252,R01MH104414,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Africa', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Elements', 'Episodic memory', 'Etiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurobiology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'base', 'cognitive system', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'disorder control', 'graph theory', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'phenomenological models', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'thalamocortical tract', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,498917,0.06385127339898483
"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Integrating human connectomics and brain imaging genomics offers enormous potential, allowing us to perform systems biology approaches of the brain to better understand the interplay between genes, brain connectivity, and phenotypic outcomes (e.g., cognition, behavior, disorder). This proposal seeks to develop novel bioinformatics methods and software tools for integrative study of human connectomics and brain imaging genomics. These methods and tools can be applied to: (1) study normal brain functions to impact biomedical research in general, and (2) study brain disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics,9155025,R01EB022574,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain tract', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'evaluation/testing', 'functional outcomes', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning outcome', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'software systems', 'tool', 'trait', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NIBIB,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2016,500696,0.05251883755190112
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9021699,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Resected', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2016,531286,0.02249813947802743
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9260326,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'meetings', 'memory process', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2016,773219,0.04823505876450915
"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.            ","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9150327,R01NS095741,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Education', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Problem behavior', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'gray matter', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'information organization', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'segregation', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,604285,-0.06684635207429618
"Longitudinal brain development and clinical outcomes in ADHD from 7-17 years ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ADHD is has long been believed to include brain-based pathophysiology, but the newest approaches to describing atypical brain organization in ADHD are just emerging and are thus far limited to cross-sectional studies. The present study has as its principal aims three objectives. First, it aims to characterize ADHD's brain organization longitudinally from childhood through adolescence, during a period of time in which ADHD youth enter very high risk for negative life outcomes, poor health outcomes, and comorbid behavioral, mood, and substance use disorders. In particular, the project aims to determine specified circuits, unique brain networks, and brain wide topological properties that relate to clinical course and outcome. Second, the proposal aims to bridge these developmental brain features with an enriched conception of phenotype, examining symptom domains, comorbidity, and measures of executive, reward, and emotional functioning in relation to specified brain metrics and targets. Third, it seeks to move the field forward in regard to clinica prediction by considering heterogeneity in two ways. One way is to examine novel typologies of ADHD based on differential brain organization across development. The other way is to utilize multiple methods to enhance prediction of clinical course. The significance of this effort lies bot in its unprecedented ability to characterize ADHD neurobiology over time with methods of brain characterization that have not been examined in ADHD longitudinally in this way before, and in its effort to move brain imaging into the realm of clinical prediction using a longitudinal design. The project is innovative in regard to implementing network and topology features of brain analysis in a multi-wave design, and tightly linking these to well defined, multi-level clinical course. The approach entails tracking of an already developed novel cohort of 376 children in a cross-lagged longitudinal design, enabling characterization of development from age 7-19 years. Brain organization will be operationalized with both diffusion tensor imaging and resting state functional connectivity. Youth will be characterized annually in relation to clinical symptoms, comorbidity, impairment, cognitive functioning, reward discounting, and emotion regulation and functioning. Analytic approaches will span brain circuit, network, and topological measurements using novel graph theoretical analyses to characterize brain systems. Clinical prediction will be undertaken using machine learning methodologies. Clinical typologies will be evaluated using both novel community detection procedures and more standard mixture model analysis of brain features. Finally, latent class trajectory models will be used to identify distint developmental types of ADHD if they exist. The prior grant period has been productive and this work builds on those findings to strengthen inference regarding the relation of brain organization to ADHD clinical features, course, and outcome. The Aims directly match key priorities of the NIMH strategic plan. If successful, the project hopes to break the impasse facing the field with regard to clinical utility of the growing grasp of atypical brain physiology in ADHD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much has been learned about brain correlates of ADHD, but this work has not yet affected clinical practice. The present project would characterize individual variation in ADHD brain development and attempt to use those findings to enhance clinical prediction. It thus aims to move the field closer to clinical application of brain imaging information of ADHD.",Longitudinal brain development and clinical outcomes in ADHD from 7-17 years,9208912,R56MH086654,"['19 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Conceptions', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Thick', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Typology', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'discounting', 'emotion regulation', 'graph theory', 'grasp', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'time use']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R56,2016,769969,0.07193948289900297
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.",Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction,9097801,R01MH101487,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adjustment Disorders', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Illness impact', 'Incentives', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Functioning', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'disturbance in affect', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'genome wide association study', 'instrument', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'negative mood', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,562097,-0.012451244821946487
"Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network Project Summary: Skilled use of tools is a defining achievement of human cognition, and is enabled by the storage of tool-specific action memories. Many tools are associated with more than one action, and most everyday tasks are associated with more than one tool. Limb apraxia is a common, disabling, and puzzling left-hemisphere disorder characterized by prominent deficits in activating and selecting task-appropriate tool actions. Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms and brain regions enabling such selection in the neurologically intact brain, or how these processes go awry in apraxia. In several other cognitive domains, it has been suggested that appropriate response selection occurs via biased competition—that is, the prioritization of competing incoming information to enable appropriate response selection. Capitalizing on the promise of such frameworks, we have developed a new functional-neuroanatomic model of biased competition in a specific left hemisphere Tool Use network. Called “Two Action Systems Plus” (2AS+), the model generates testable hypotheses about the major principles determining tool action selection, and their deficiencies in apraxia. Specifically, we hypothesize that 1) Competition between tool actions is influenced by the graded similarity of tool action representations, as implemented primarily by the left posterior temporal cortex (pTC), 2) The outcome of the competitive process is affected by the strength and timing of activation of tool action representations, and depends on the dynamic interplay of left pTC and the parietal lobes, 3) Outcome is further influenced by a mechanism that biases competition towards the tool action that is appropriate to goals and context, as implemented by the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and its connections with the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and 4) There are two subtypes of apraxia characterized by distinct failures in the competitive selection process: an anterior subtype characterized by inability to appropriately resolve tool action competition, and a posterior subtype reflecting weakened competition. These hypotheses will be tested using a number of complementary methods with healthy and brain-lesioned participants, including voxel-based lesion symptom mapping, resting functional connectivity, fMRI with multi-voxel pattern analyses, and eyetracking. By specifying when and how visuomotor information plays a role in tool representations, the proposed experiments promise to critically constrain “embodied” cognition theories claiming that tools automatically evoke their actions. The proposed research will also advance the theoretical understanding of tool action by anchoring relevant constructs in a cognitive-neuroanatomic model, clarify how action representations are organized and activated, and improve our understanding of the mechanisms affecting errors and re-learning in apraxia, with implications for rehabilitation. Project Narrative: Apraxia, a disorder of tool use, is a common and substantially disabling consequence of left hemisphere stroke, yet is relatively rarely studied and hence poorly understood. The proposed work will clarify the brain regions that are associated with the disorder, the task factors that may improve tool use abilities, and the ability of the damaged Tool Use system to learn after stroke. This information will serve as an important building block in the development of treatment strategies.",Understanding Action Selection in the Tool Use Network,9213205,R01NS099061,"['Achievement', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Apraxias', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cheese', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'experience', 'improved', 'novel', 'research study', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'visual motor']",NINDS,ALBERT EINSTEIN HEALTHCARE NETWORK,R01,2016,431274,-0.0017925637019444785
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

"Large-scale Network Modeling for Brain Dynamics: Statistical Learning and Optimization Summary The human brain is a large, well-connected, and dynamic network. Using functional MRI data, modeling how this network processes the stimulus information has yielded insight on some of the mechanisms of the brain. However, the past efforts, including ours, on using small-scale models yielded limited understanding of how the complete and dynamic neural system functions in task-related experiments. Such understanding cannot be recovered from the data without substantial and collaborative efforts on model development. Towards this goal, we formed a collaborative team from modelers to end-users, and we will develop large-scale methods for task related fMRI (tfMRI), including event-related fMRI, to model whole-brain network dynamics responding to task challenges. Using modern statistical learning principals and large-scale optimization algorithms, we will develop novel methods to model nonlinear, spatial-temporal dependence in high dimensional data of fMRI, stimuli, and behavior outcomes. We will primarily base our methods in the regularized, constrained graphical model (GM) framework, a promising multivariate framework for inferring brain connectivity that has been validated by simulation and anatomical studies. Using this framework, we will develop novel methods to investigate, at a large scale, how changes in connectivity and activation are driven by task challenges and how multiple brain pathways process stimulus information. We will perform comprehensive validation and assessment of the newly developed methods, using both simulated and multiple tfMRI data from large cohorts. Using the scale of modeling that previous approaches cannot readily address without substantial time penalties and maybe also inaccuracies, our collaborative team will also use these methods to investigate various novel questions and hypotheses concerning the neural basis for cognitive control as one of the use cases. We will also develop publicly available, open source implementations for a broad range of use in the neuroimaging community. These modeling efforts will lead to new insights on the networks of large-scale neural circuits, and provide pharmacological targets that may be overlooked using small-scale models.     PUBLIC RELEVANCE STATEMENT We propose a foundational framework for modeling whole-brain network dynamics. Our computational approaches and algorithms will help scientists analyze a wide range of neuroimaging and behavioral data, which will lead to the capability to discover therapeutic and pharmacological targets for treating neurological and psychiatric disorders.",Large-scale Network Modeling for Brain Dynamics: Statistical Learning and Optimization,9170649,R01EB022911,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Space Models', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brain pathway', 'cognitive control', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information model', 'information processing', 'insight', 'large scale simulation', 'model development', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'stimulus processing', 'tool']",NIBIB,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,430066,-0.0018217299094376504
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes).

"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging. The methods will be carefully evaluated via theory, simulation and data-based application evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern neuroimaging data are often Big, Complex, Noisy and Dependent. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of network estimation and mining based on neuroimaging data. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology and has the potential to be applied to analyze a wide range of scientific problems beyond brain imaging data analysis.",Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience,8998688,R01MH102339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'brain research', 'cloud based', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'study population', 'theories', 'user friendly software', 'web services']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,368829,0.02265736940693029
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9109682,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,454953,0.03097195286334777
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and difﬁculties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speciﬁc brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speciﬁc behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ﬁrst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ﬁnding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care. A primary goal of this project is to create open-source software that is used by the neuroscience community to advance research in understanding the brain basis of behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders. Project Narrative This grant is focused on developing novel analysis of complex brain networks from structural and functional imaging and using this to link brain features to behavioral phenotypes. These algorithms will be used to discover brain biomarkers of behavioral traits in Autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders.","Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes",9170673,R01EB022876,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyped Behavior', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain shape', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'social', 'trait']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2016,377500,-0.017099867223593936
"Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This lack of progress is reflected in the continued excessive direct and indirect health care expenditure related to these conditions, largely in form of unnecessary diagnostic procedures to rule out ""organic"" disease and lack of novel, cost effective therapies. During the past funding cycle, we have identified functional alterations of brain networks in IBS patients, both in the resting state and in response to physical and psychological stimuli, which are related to sex, gene polymorphisms and a history of early adverse life events. These functional findings were accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of both white and grey matter in the brain of IBS patients resulting in a distinct ""brai signature"". In this revised competitive renewal application, I plan to take these insights to the next level by validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IB patients from healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome. Using an array of advanced, innovative brain imaging, genomic and microbiological techniques, I will address these goals in 3 Specific Aims: A. Identify disease- specific brain signatures of IBS, identify correlations of these signatures with behavioral and clinical parameters, and determine accuracy to predict IBS phenotype compared to HCs, and patients with chronic gut inflammation (ulcerative colitis). B. Identify gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and correlate with distinct brain signatures in IBS patients as identified in Aim A. C. Identify gut microbiome derived metabolites which correlate with brain signatures in IBS patients. The longitudinal design of the study combined with a mediator/moderator analysis approach will enable us to infer causality between brain, peripheral factors and symptoms, and will provide the basis for future mechanistic studies in animal models. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to improve our understanding of the complex bidirectional brain gut interactions of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS and identify biomarkers in order to develop more effective treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 15% of the U.S. population and leads to a substantial economic and societal burden. Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for IBS. This proposal is relevant to public health in that it is aimed at validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IBS patients fro healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome to provide the basis for mechanistic studies, advance our knowledge of IBS pathophysiology and aid future development of IBS therapies.",Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation,9113551,R01DK048351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Animal Model', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Metadata', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visceral', 'base', 'brain shape', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,606065,0.01269887914085979

"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,9067148,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'heart rate monitor', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature neonates', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,642962,0.021922176823492345
"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity        ",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9108126,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'collaborative environment', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2016,190342,0.033671486339016767
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. We will also disseminate our approaches through software tools and interactive web-based visualization of available data. 37",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,9185800,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Shipping', 'Ships', 'Software Tools', 'Symptoms', 'Tars', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data reduction', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'design', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'multitask', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'web portal', 'white matter change']",NIBIB,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2016,400000,0.03228437392936248

"Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets. We anticipate that this approach will provide a key pillar to the development of a brain-based understanding of the heterogeneity of psychiatric disease.

"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.            ",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,8814543,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,477101,0.0016114495582846143
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts.

"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.            ",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,8900645,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Resected', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2015,552097,0.02249813947802743
"Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research program is to develop new treatments for improving behavioral deficits post-stroke based on a formal theory of brain function and organization. However, the immediate goal of this competitive renewal is to identify patterns of disrupted structural and functional connectivity that are related to stroke-induced deficits, determine how they change during recovery, and see if they predict outcome. Computational theories have proposed that lesions to the brain will have different effects based on the underlying network architecture. Mechanisms controlling recovery of function may similarly depend on network architecture. Specific Aim 1 measures changes in whole brain functional connectivity (FC) after damage to peripheral networks that are mainly connected within the network vs. central networks that communicate more broadly with other brain networks. We measure separately the effect of cortical vs. white matter pathway damage. We predict that peripheral lesions (either to gray or white matter) will produce FC changes that are mainly limited to the affected network, while central lesions (either gray or white matter) will produce multi- network FC changes. Peripheral networks are connected to input/output pathways and mediate predominantly sensory or motor functions. Central networks are connected through association pathways and mediate predominantly attention and memory functions. Specific Aim 2 uses a machine learning ridge regression method to test the idea that sensory-motor deficits and their recovery are more dependent on structural damage and anatomical disconnection, whereas cognitive impairments are better captured by multi-network functional connectivity dysfunction. An important clinical goal of the project is to determine whether advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as structural imaging, DTI, and fMRI can provide useful clinical information on an individual patient's recovery and outcome, over and above that provided by measures of acute behavior, demographic variables, and amount of treatment. In Specific Aim 3 we enter neuroimaging data into a classifier to predict outcome in individual patients, as well as to predict the effect of rehabilitation interventions. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we move from correlation and prediction to mechanism. Our basic hypothesis is that changes in functional connectivity after focal injury reflect alterations in brain dynamics, specifically a decrease in the variability of inter-regional phase differences. This hypothesis is tested empirically by phase measurements, but also computationally, using a biophysically based model that can simulate the FC changes observed in patients. Importantly, the model also estimates the information capacity of the damaged brain, which we will correlate with the patient's empirically measured degree of modularity and profile of behavioral deficits.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to use advanced neuroimaging techniques to understand how a stroke changes the large-scale physiology of the brain, and how those changes in turn relate to the behavioral problems caused by the stroke. We use techniques that allow us to measure how a stroke damages the connectivity of the brain, both by damaging the fiber bundles that transmit information between brain regions, but also by changing the functional communication across many brain regions. We test hypotheses concerning: 1) how damage to different parts of the brain affect these measures of connectivity; 2) how measures of connectivity can help us to predict the outcome of individual stroke patients; and, 3) whether computational modeling of connectivity can help us understand the behavioral deficits caused by a stroke.            ","Stroke, Brain Networks, and Behavior",9064398,R01NS095741,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Part', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Education', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Problem behavior', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'gray matter', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'information organization', 'motor deficit', 'neglect', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'post stroke', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'segregation', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,621558,-0.06684635207429618
"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables. Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on the effects of adolescent marijuana use on working memory, inhibitory control and corticostriatal systems.        ",ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project,9052904,U01DA041028,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent marijuana use', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'behavioral health', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'nonhuman primate', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'time use', 'trend']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2015,128696,0.018055544514774025
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.

A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior. We employ a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate this interaction during a variety of cognitive tasks.                ",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,8814777,R01MH071589,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Image', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Paper', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual attention', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive task', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'improved', 'information processing', 'motivated behavior', 'motivational processes', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'theories']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2015,561912,0.011888150498367842
"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging. The methods will be carefully evaluated via theory, simulation and data-based application evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern neuroimaging data are often Big, Complex, Noisy and Dependent. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of network estimation and mining based on neuroimaging data. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology and has the potential to be applied to analyze a wide range of scientific problems beyond brain imaging data analysis.",Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience,8795225,R01MH102339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain research', 'cloud based', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'simulation', 'theories', 'user friendly software', 'web services']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,369756,0.02265736940693029
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.                ",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,8956794,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,382086,0.03097195286334777
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 2/13 ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC) will establish harmonized MRI protocols across Sites and scanners, perform quality control of raw- and derived data, and implement the informatics and computational infrastructure needed for the overall project.            ",ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center,9054644,U24DA041123,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality Control', 'Questionnaires', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Uncertainty', 'adolescent brain development', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'design', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'time use', 'tool', 'trend']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2015,750000,0.04168979906212188
"Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This lack of progress is reflected in the continued excessive direct and indirect health care expenditure related to these conditions, largely in form of unnecessary diagnostic procedures to rule out ""organic"" disease and lack of novel, cost effective therapies. During the past funding cycle, we have identified functional alterations of brain networks in IBS patients, both in the resting state and in response to physical and psychological stimuli, which are related to sex, gene polymorphisms and a history of early adverse life events. These functional findings were accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of both white and grey matter in the brain of IBS patients resulting in a distinct ""brai signature"". In this revised competitive renewal application, I plan to take these insights to the next level by validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IB patients from healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome. Using an array of advanced, innovative brain imaging, genomic and microbiological techniques, I will address these goals in 3 Specific Aims: A. Identify disease- specific brain signatures of IBS, identify correlations of these signatures with behavioral and clinical parameters, and determine accuracy to predict IBS phenotype compared to HCs, and patients with chronic gut inflammation (ulcerative colitis). B. Identify gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and correlate with distinct brain signatures in IBS patients as identified in Aim A. C. Identify gut microbiome derived metabolites which correlate with brain signatures in IBS patients. The longitudinal design of the study combined with a mediator/moderator analysis approach will enable us to infer causality between brain, peripheral factors and symptoms, and will provide the basis for future mechanistic studies in animal models. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to improve our understanding of the complex bidirectional brain gut interactions of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS and identify biomarkers in order to develop more effective treatment strategies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 15% of the U.S. population and leads to a substantial economic and societal burden. Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for IBS. This proposal is relevant to public health in that it is aimed at validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IBS patients fro healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome to provide the basis for mechanistic studies, advance our knowledge of IBS pathophysiology and aid future development of IBS therapies.            ",Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation,8926075,R01DK048351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Animal Model', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intestines', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Metadata', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visceral', 'base', 'brain shape', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2015,643700,0.01269887914085979
"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8856234,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,614823,0.021922176823492345
"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.

"Large-scale Automated Synthesis of Functional Neuroimaging Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosive growth of the human neuroimaging literature has led to major advances in understanding of normal and abnormal human brain function, but has also made aggregation and synthesis of neuroimaging findings increasingly difficult. The goal of this project is to develop an automated software platform for large-scale synthesis of human functional neuroimaging studies. Our work builds directly on an existing software platform (NeuroSynth) and involves key extensions and improvements that focus on (i) aggregation, (ii) coding, (iii) synthesis, and (iv) sharing of functional neuroimaging data. In Aim 1, we will use computational linguistics and bioinformatics data mining techniques to develop new algorithms for automatically extracting activation foci and associated metadata from published neuroimaging articles. In Aim 2, we will use topic-modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Analysis in combination with existing cognitive ontologies such as the Cognitive Atlas to develop structured representations of automatically extracted neuroimaging data. In Aim 3, we will improve the meta-analysis and classification capacities of our existing platform by implementing a state-of- the-art hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis method recently developed by the research team. Finally, in Aim 4, we will develop a state-of-the-art web interface (://neurosynth.org) that supports real-time, in-browser access to the data, results, and tools produced in Aims 1 - 3. Realizing these objectives will introduce powerful new tools for organizing and synthesizing the neuroimaging literature on an unprecedented scale. These tools will be freely and publicly available to anyone with an internet connection, enabling rapid and efficient application to a broad range of clinical and basic research applications. Functional neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI have opened a new frontier in efforts to investigate and understand the neural mechanisms of normal and abnormal cognition. However, the rapidly expanding scope of the literature makes distillation and synthesis of brain imaging findings increasingly challenging. The goal of this project is to develop a new software platform for automated aggregation, synthesis, and sharing of published neuroimaging results, with the potential to advance understanding of mechanisms underlying mental health disorders.",Large-scale Automated Synthesis of Functional Neuroimaging Data,8894083,R01MH096906,"['Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Ontology', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'data mining', 'frontier', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuromechanism', 'open source', 'psychologic', 'theories', 'tool', 'web interface']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2015,547000,0.005270479419271332
"Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnostic system for neuropsychiatric conditions embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM) is based on clusters of symptoms rather than on underlying etiology or pathophysiology. The establishment of reliable diagnoses was a critical step in the advancement of psychiatric science three decades ago, but now it holds the field back by concealing relationships between brain biology and individual patients' symptoms - relationships that are obscure under the best of circumstances. This realization motivates a search for an alternative, brain-based diagnostic system, in the form of the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The development of such an alternative diagnostic framework is in its infancy, and new strategies are needed for the rational categorization of pathophysiological states.  We have successfully used data-driven analysis of functional connectivity data, derived from functional neuroimaging of the brain at rest. This approach has revealed neural dysconnectivity across several neuropsychiatric conditions. We will apply these data-driven approaches, in conjunction with leading machine learning algorithms, to quantify dysconnectivity patterns across and within major DSM disorders.  We have assembled a dataset of 707 resting-state scans, performed on state-of-the-art 3T scanners and passing rigorous quality control standards, comprising five major DSM diagnoses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, with matched controls for each. Accompanying symptom assessments were administered by highly skilled personnel. This large hybrid dataset permits an unprecedented cross-diagnostic, data-driven search for shared or distinct dysconnectivity across diagnoses. Specifically, we will employ a powerful multi-tiered analytic approach using: fully data-driven connectivity analysis, focusing on networks defined a priori by work in healthy subjects, and a seed-based approach focused on circuits associated with the constituent DSM diagnoses.  We hypothesize several possible outcomes. First, patient groups derived from the data-driven connectivity analyses may indeed map onto symptom-based DSM diagnoses. This would be a validation of a symptom- focused nosology, at least across these conditions. Second, data-driven analysis may identify new categories that cut across DSM diagnoses. Third, results may follow continua of dysconnectivity, such as those proposed by the RDoC framework. A more complex outcome that blends these patterns is also probable. Finally, emergent patterns will be correlated against symptom measures, within and across disorders.  Irrespective of the ultimate pattern, results of this project will critically inform ongoing effort to refine a diagnostic scheme for psychiatric disorders that is firmly grounded in their pathophysiology. Furthermore, the methodology will be applicable to other datasets. We anticipate that this approach will provide a key pillar to the development of a brain-based understanding of the heterogeneity of psychiatric disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current psychiatric nosology, embodied in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM), is based on symptom clusters rather than underlying etiology or pathophysiology, which fundamentally limits attempts to develop novel rationally guided and biologically informed interventions. We propose to use neuroimaging measures of functional brain connectivity from multiple DSM disorders to identify fully data- driven patterns of dysconnectivity across and within existing diagnostic entities. The identified patterns will reveal abnormalities in neural network function independent of DSM diagnoses and will critically inform new brain-based diagnostic proposals, such as that envisioned by the NIMH's RDoC initiative.            ",Neuropsychiatric Classification via Connectivity and Machine Learning,8808026,R03MH105765,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Arbitration', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality Control', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Secondary to', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'case control', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'disease classification', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2014,74072,0.03546645397457264
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders. Identifying coherent subpopulations within the spectrum of pathological changes would further our understanding of disease etiology, and identify subconditions that require alternative or modified interventions.                ",CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION,8757373,R01MH104414,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Africa', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Elements', 'Episodic memory', 'Etiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurobiology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'base', 'cognitive system', 'computerized tools', 'disorder control', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'thalamocortical tract', 'theories', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,488401,0.06385127339898483
"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.  This project examines whether signals recorded directly from the human brain (during surgery for epilepsy) could be used to control a robotic hand.

"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.          Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.

"Action for Health in Diabetes Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ancillary Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preservation of brain health is a critical goal in the care of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who are at increased risk for atrophy, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. Weight loss and increased physical activity hold promise as potentially effective strategies for this purpose, but are currently unproven in any population. Because unintended weight loss often precedes declines in later life brain health, a randomized controlled clinical trial is necessary, which must feature an effective behavioral intervention that is sustained over a long period of time in a large well characterized cohort. Mounting such a program de novo would be very expensive. Instead, we propose to make use of the ongoing and very successful Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) randomized controlled clinical trial, adding cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to its extensive data collection protocol. This is feasible: participants in clinical trials have been repeatedly shown to be willing to join brain imaging studies and we have developed successful protocols for maintaining safety, confidentiality, and quality. This is novel: Look AHEAD and the state-of-the-art MRI protocols that we propose provide an unprecedented opportunity to assess the long-term effectiveness of mid-life behavioral changes on brain structure and function and to advance understanding of brain health in diabetes. We address an important public health priority for a rapidly growing and under-studied segment of the US population in a cost-effective manner, leveraging the extensive research resources available from Look AHEAD. We respond to PAR-09-247, which targets ancillary study applications to major NIDDK clinical trials, including Look AHEAD. We will enroll 496 participants, ages 55-85 years with type 2 diabetes, from 3 Look AHEAD clinics. They will have been randomly assigned 10 years ago when they were obese or overweight, with equal probability, to either an ongoing intensive lifestyle intervention that has induced sustained weight loss and increased physical activity or control condition (diabetes support and education) that has fostered excellent retention. A proven protocol for standardized structural MRI will provide regional brain and ischemic lesion volumes; functional MRI will provide assessments of functional activation, resting state connectivity, and cerebral blood flow. A tested cognitive battery and physical activity assessment will be administered. A comprehensive analysis of these data will make use of established statistical approaches and novel machine-learning methods. Look AHEAD provides extensive 10-year characterizations of participant's health and behavior, their medical care and its cost, and the trial's interventions; state-of-the art data management systems; and provisions for developing public access databases. Our research team includes established and productive experts in brain imaging, diabetes research, behavioral medicine, data and image analysis, neuroepidemiology, and collaboration.

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level  ABSTRACT: This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification. Together, these studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of brain connectivity and brain activity in autism, and set the direction for my future career.  PROJECT NARRATIVE: These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism. This will be important information for guiding future diagnoses and intervention.",Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level,8681538,R00MH094409,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lobe', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'theories', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R00,2014,232967,0.012899132051720478
"Growth factors, neuroinflammation, exercise, and brain integrity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aging brain suffers from progressive brain tissue loss, putting hundreds of millions of us at risk for memory loss and dementia with no known cure. We recently discovered, in studies related to physical activity, growth factors, and homocysteine, several new leads about what may promote brain integrity. These variables interact with each other, with inflammation, and with brain structure and disease risk in complex and striking ways. To resist the looming epidemic of degenerative disease, we must determine how such variables deter brain decline. We will map, with unprecedented sensitivity, how these vital processes, which are targetable with interventions, relate to brain structure. We also combine brain measures to predict, with machine learning who will imminently decline. We relate brain and cognitive decline in 3 populations to (1) an inflammatory marker and related neurodegenerative risk genes, (2) growth factor and homocysteine levels, and (3) physical exercise. We will discover how these variables interact to promote or deter brain disease, in our regions of interest (ROIs) - the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and cingulate gyrus. This work is crucial to combat diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia (SZ), among others that are both related to these variables and marked by deficits in these ROIs. We will also survey the whole brain with novel brain mapping methods. Physical activity promotes human brain regeneration in these regions, in part through its effects on growth factors. It decreases inflammation and homocysteine levels, both of which relate to hippocampal integrity. Our project will boost power in clinical trials by identifying targetable disease-driving mechanisms. Building on our recent discoveries, we use (1) genotyped variants in inflammation-related genes, (2) a controllable ""environmental"" variable (exercise), and (3) peripheral measures related to inflammation, neurogenesis, and homocysteine to assess integrity of the hippocampus, PFC, and cingulate gyrus, and their progressive decline. We examine three populations already scanned with MRI: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (566 AD, MCI, and normal elderly subjects), the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 517 AD, MCI, and control subjects; of whom 85 have our targeted serum measures), and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, composed of younger adults from families with autosomal dominant AD mutations (DIAN; ~400: ~20% with AD; ~50% mutation carriers). We will assess: 3/4 how candidate gene variants associated with AD and inflammation (see Approach) relate to a serum marker of inflammation (tumor necrosis factor alpha;TNFα), and to hippocampal volume. 3/4 how serum levels of growth factors and homocysteine relate to hippocampal, PFC, and cingulate volume. 3/4 how exercise levels affect hippocampal volume; how growth factors and TNFα modulate this relationship. 3/4 how baseline serum levels of growth factors, TNFα, and homocysteine, polymorphisms in related genes, and exercise together predict brain and cognitive changes over a 2-year follow-up period. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our project will have major impact on public health by discovering how three key processes (inflammation, brain growth factors, and exercise) relate to brain structure and brain decline over a 2-year period. Physical exercise boosts the ability of growth factors to promote regeneration in the hippocampus, which is important in memory; inflammation (which has many causes, including disease) decreases that ability. Our last 20 years of work revealed how Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and drug abuse involve hippocampal deficits and brain atrophy. Here we will evaluate in three large populations how growth factors, inflammation, and exercise work together to protect or harm the human brain - identifying promising directions for treatment, prevention, and a mechanistic understanding of diseases and disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.","Growth factors, neuroinflammation, exercise, and brain integrity",8696676,RF1AG041915,"['Aerobic', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amino Acids', 'Atrophic', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Employee Strikes', 'Encephalitis', 'Epidemic', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Growth Factor', 'Growth Factor Gene', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Homocysteine', 'Homocystine', 'Horns', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Process', 'Inflammatory', 'Inherited', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Growth Factors', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Growth', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Width', 'Work', 'adult neurogenesis', 'aging brain', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'brain-derived growth factor', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cingulate gyrus', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'combat', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'gray matter', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'immune function', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mental state', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'mutation carrier', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurogenesis', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotropic', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,RF1,2014,2938975,-0.05488413945900775
"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience     DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging. The methods will be carefully evaluated via theory, simulation and data-based application evidence.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern neuroimaging data are often Big, Complex, Noisy and Dependent. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of network estimation and mining based on neuroimaging data. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology and has the potential to be applied to analyze a wide range of scientific problems beyond brain imaging data analysis.                ",Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience,8611397,R01MH102339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain research', 'cloud based', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'theories', 'user friendly software', 'web services']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,378911,0.02265736940693029
"Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing structure-function correlations is fundamental to understanding how information is processed in the central nervous system (CNS). Axonal connectivity is a key relationship that facilitates information transmission and reception within the CNS. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) methods have been shown to provide fundamental information required for viewing structural connectivity and have allowed visualization of fiber bundles in the CNS in vivo. In this project, we propose to develop methods for extraction and analysis of these patterns from high angular resolution diffusion weighted images (HARDI) that is known to have better resolving power over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, a biologically relevant and clinically important model has been chosen to study changes in the organization of fibers in the intact and injured spinal cord. Our hypothesis is that, changes in geometrical properties of the anatomical substrate, identifying the region of injury and neuroplastic changes in distant spinal segments, correlate with different magnitudes of injury and levels of locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Prior to hypothesis testing, we will denoise the HARDI data and then construct a normal atlas cord. Deformable registration and tensor morphometry between a normal atlas and an injured cord would be performed to provide a distinct signature for each type of behavior recovery associated with the SCI substrate. Validation of the hypothesis will be performed through systematic histological analysis of cord samples following acquisition of the HARDI data. Spinal cords will be cut and stained with fiber and cell stains to verify changes in anatomical organization that result from contusive injury (common in humans as well) to the spinal cord. A comparison between anatomical characteristics obtained from histological versus HARDI analysis will provide validation for the image analysis and the hypothesis. Three severities of spinal cord injuries will be produced (light, mild and moderate contusions) based upon normed injury device parameters. The structural signatures of these labeled data subsets will then be identified. Automatic classification of novel & injured cord HARDI data sets will then be achieved using a large margin classifier. Finally, HARDI data acquired over time will be analyzed in order to learn and predict the level of locomotor recovery by studying the structural changes over time and developing a dynamic model of structural transformations corresponding to each chosen class. We will use an auto-regressive model in the feature space to track and predict structural changes in SCI and correlate it to functional recovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Diffusion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies. Although the various algorithms developed here are for analysis of SCI, they can be used in other applications such as traumatic brain injury, in tracking and predicting developmental changes etc. from diffusion MRI scans.               ",Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju,8628880,R01NS066340,"['Algebraic Geometry', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Contusions', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Diffusion weighted imaging', 'Distant', 'Fiber', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Locomotor Recovery', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neuraxis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Registers', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'expectation', 'fiber cell', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'interest', 'member', 'morphometry', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'transmission process']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2014,494546,0.015355862482919749
"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.        Program Director (Last, first, middle): Kleinfeld, David, Kaufhold, John and Squier, Jeffrey. These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain. We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments. The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine: One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma. The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.",Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses,8729873,R01EB003832,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Beds', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Craniotomy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Laminectomy', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Ursidae Family', 'Veins', 'Work', 'arteriole', 'base', 'bone', 'brain cell', 'capillary', 'design', 'hemodynamics', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'second harmonic', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,812810,0.02120515951288466
"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.                ",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8688242,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,602789,0.021922176823492345
"Large-scale Automated Synthesis of Functional Neuroimaging Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosive growth of the human neuroimaging literature has led to major advances in understanding of normal and abnormal human brain function, but has also made aggregation and synthesis of neuroimaging findings increasingly difficult. The goal of this project is to develop an automated software platform for large-scale synthesis of human functional neuroimaging studies. Our work builds directly on an existing software platform (NeuroSynth) and involves key extensions and improvements that focus on (i) aggregation, (ii) coding, (iii) synthesis, and (iv) sharing of functional neuroimaging data. In Aim 1, we will use computational linguistics and bioinformatics data mining techniques to develop new algorithms for automatically extracting activation foci and associated metadata from published neuroimaging articles. In Aim 2, we will use topic-modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Analysis in combination with existing cognitive ontologies such as the Cognitive Atlas to develop structured representations of automatically extracted neuroimaging data. In Aim 3, we will improve the meta-analysis and classification capacities of our existing platform by implementing a state-of- the-art hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis method recently developed by the research team. Finally, in Aim 4, we will develop a state-of-the-art web interface (://neurosynth.org) that supports real-time, in-browser access to the data, results, and tools produced in Aims 1 - 3. Realizing these objectives will introduce powerful new tools for organizing and synthesizing the neuroimaging literature on an unprecedented scale. These tools will be freely and publicly available to anyone with an internet connection, enabling rapid and efficient application to a broad range of clinical and basic research applications.          Functional neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI have opened a new frontier in efforts to investigate and understand the neural mechanisms of normal and abnormal cognition. However, the rapidly expanding scope of the literature makes distillation and synthesis of brain imaging findings increasingly challenging.

"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics. Algorithms that consider multiple genetic variants jointly, we propose, are likely to (1) more powerfully detect new gene effects on brain images, and (2) identify profiles of candidate genetic variants to assist prediction of an individual's brain integrity and risk for disease.       Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability across the world. By developing new computerized models for the prediction of clinical outcomes based on disease-specific neuroimaging, biochemical and genetic biomarkers as well as the early prediction of white matter integrity based on genetic profiles, we hope to pave the way to personalized prevention and management of brain disorders.",Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning,8448904,F30AG041681,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anisotropy', 'Back', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'gene discovery', 'gene interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'response', 'time interval', 'treatment response', 'white matter', 'working group']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F30,2013,47232,0.02866370605336986

These people know what they want to do as well as how they would do it if their arms were functional. If such knowledge is decoded and sent to a prosthetic arm (or to the patient's own arm fitted with functional electric stimulators) the lost motor function could be restored. The decoding is unlikely to be perfect however the brain can adapt to an imperfect decoder using real-time feedback. Several groups including ours have recently demonstrated that at least in principle this can be achieved. However, as is often the case in science, the initial work has been done in idealized conditions and its applicability to real-world usage scenarios remains an open question. The goal of this project is to bring movement control brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) closer to helping the people who need them, and at the same time exploit the rich datasets we collect in order to advance our understanding of sensorimotor control and learning. This will be accomplished by creating hybrid BMIs which exploit information from multiple sources, combined with modern algorithms from machine learning and automatic control. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Being able to interact with the physical environment and manipulate objects is an essential part of daily life. Brain-machine interfaces are one way to restore this ability to patients who have lost it. The proposed project will bring brain-machine interfaces closer to helping patients in real-worid object manipulation tasks.  n/a",CRCNS: Hybrid non-invasive brain-machine interfaces for 3D object manipulation,8507287,R01NS073120,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Eye Movements', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head Movements', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lifting', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neck', 'Patients', 'Physical environment', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prosthesis', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'arm', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'grasp', 'instrument', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,240369,0.010036522301298029
"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.  This project examines whether signals recorded directly from the human brain (during surgery for epilepsy) could be used to control a robotic hand.

"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.          Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.                ",Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction,8573671,R01MH101487,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adjustment Disorders', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Illness impact', 'Incentives', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Functioning', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'disturbance in affect', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'genome wide association study', 'instrument', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'negative mood', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2013,627944,-0.012451244821946487
"Action for Health in Diabetes Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ancillary Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preservation of brain health is a critical goal in the care of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who are at increased risk for atrophy, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. Weight loss and increased physical activity hold promise as potentially effective strategies for this purpose, but are currently unproven in any population. Because unintended weight loss often precedes declines in later life brain health, a randomized controlled clinical trial is necessary, which must feature an effective behavioral intervention that is sustained over a long period of time in a large well characterized cohort. Mounting such a program de novo would be very expensive. Instead, we propose to make use of the ongoing and very successful Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) randomized controlled clinical trial, adding cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to its extensive data collection protocol. This is feasible: participants in clinical trials have been repeatedly shown to be willing to join brain imaging studies and we have developed successful protocols for maintaining safety, confidentiality, and quality. This is novel: Look AHEAD and the state-of-the-art MRI protocols that we propose provide an unprecedented opportunity to assess the long-term effectiveness of mid-life behavioral changes on brain structure and function and to advance understanding of brain health in diabetes. We address an important public health priority for a rapidly growing and under-studied segment of the US population in a cost-effective manner, leveraging the extensive research resources available from Look AHEAD. We respond to PAR-09-247, which targets ancillary study applications to major NIDDK clinical trials, including Look AHEAD. We will enroll 496 participants, ages 55-85 years with type 2 diabetes, from 3 Look AHEAD clinics. They will have been randomly assigned 10 years ago when they were obese or overweight, with equal probability, to either an ongoing intensive lifestyle intervention that has induced sustained weight loss and increased physical activity or control condition (diabetes support and education) that has fostered excellent retention. A proven protocol for standardized structural MRI will provide regional brain and ischemic lesion volumes; functional MRI will provide assessments of functional activation, resting state connectivity, and cerebral blood flow. A tested cognitive battery and physical activity assessment will be administered. A comprehensive analysis of these data will make use of established statistical approaches and novel machine-learning methods. Look AHEAD provides extensive 10-year characterizations of participant's health and behavior, their medical care and its cost, and the trial's interventions; state-of-the art data management systems; and provisions for developing public access databases.

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level  ABSTRACT: This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification. Together, these studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of brain connectivity and brain activity in autism, and set the direction for my future career.  PROJECT NARRATIVE: These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism. This will be important information for guiding future diagnoses and intervention.",Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level,8542895,R00MH094409,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lobe', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'theories', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R00,2013,232307,0.012899132051720478
"Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing structure-function correlations is fundamental to understanding how information is processed in the central nervous system (CNS). Axonal connectivity is a key relationship that facilitates information transmission and reception within the CNS. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) methods have been shown to provide fundamental information required for viewing structural connectivity and have allowed visualization of fiber bundles in the CNS in vivo. In this project, we propose to develop methods for extraction and analysis of these patterns from high angular resolution diffusion weighted images (HARDI) that is known to have better resolving power over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, a biologically relevant and clinically important model has been chosen to study changes in the organization of fibers in the intact and injured spinal cord. Our hypothesis is that, changes in geometrical properties of the anatomical substrate, identifying the region of injury and neuroplastic changes in distant spinal segments, correlate with different magnitudes of injury and levels of locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Prior to hypothesis testing, we will denoise the HARDI data and then construct a normal atlas cord. Deformable registration and tensor morphometry between a normal atlas and an injured cord would be performed to provide a distinct signature for each type of behavior recovery associated with the SCI substrate. Validation of the hypothesis will be performed through systematic histological analysis of cord samples following acquisition of the HARDI data. Spinal cords will be cut and stained with fiber and cell stains to verify changes in anatomical organization that result from contusive injury (common in humans as well) to the spinal cord. A comparison between anatomical characteristics obtained from histological versus HARDI analysis will provide validation for the image analysis and the hypothesis. Three severities of spinal cord injuries will be produced (light, mild and moderate contusions) based upon normed injury device parameters. The structural signatures of these labeled data subsets will then be identified. Automatic classification of novel & injured cord HARDI data sets will then be achieved using a large margin classifier. Finally, HARDI data acquired over time will be analyzed in order to learn and predict the level of locomotor recovery by studying the structural changes over time and developing a dynamic model of structural transformations corresponding to each chosen class. We will use an auto-regressive model in the feature space to track and predict structural changes in SCI and correlate it to functional recovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Diffusion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.  The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.

"Integrating Multimodal Brain Imaging Data to Assess Subtle Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional neuroimaging studies of the human brain have become increasingly important in the understanding of normal and pathological processes of cognition. Sophisticated statistical analytic frameworks have been developed to locate signal change and define brain networks involved in various tasks. However, in subtle cognitive impairment-e.g., exposure-related illness, early stages of degenerative diseases, injury, secondary illness following adjuvant therapy for cancer-these methods tend to have low sensitivity for detecting small changes in brain states resulting from mild brain dysfunction. An understanding of disease mechanism or progression of subtle cognitive dysfunction requires a novel statistical analytic framework with improved sensitivity to measure small changes in brain states. We have developed an innovative methodology that we successfully applied in measures of regional cerebral blood flow experiments. These methods use well established spatial modeling procedures, new to the functional brain imaging field, to derive statistically optimal spatial summaries within effective resolution groups or ""kriging"", shown by preliminary studies to improve signal detection sensitivity and mitigate the multiple testing burden. Within this new spatial modeling framework, we propose to extend the kriging methodology to fMRI and EEG, modify existing techniques for characterizing brain networks of connectivity (e.g., kriging-based independent components analysis), and integrate the imaging modalities using a statistical classifier based on derived inputs of data driven effective resolution groups. Our primary goal is to develop this analysis framework to provide insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of mild cognitive dysfunction. Achieving this goal may suggest treatments to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, or at minimum, provide an informed clinical management of cognitively impaired patients.        Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages. Causes range from traumatic injury to toxin exposures, including chemotherapy for cancer treatment, to degenerative diseases. Mechanisms of damage or disease remain difficult to establish using current methods in functional brain imaging studies due to an inability to measure very small changes in brain states. We propose a new analytic framework using existing technology to improve the ability to measure subtle changes important in the understanding of disease pathology of impaired cognition and to greatly facilitate the integration of information from several imaging modalities with potential implications for clinical management and treatment.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia. In silico hit compounds will be experimentally validated and enter hit-to-lead optimization.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.

"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.                ",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8509448,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,650062,0.021922176823492345
"Large-scale Automated Synthesis of Functional Neuroimaging Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosive growth of the human neuroimaging literature has led to major advances in understanding of normal and abnormal human brain function, but has also made aggregation and synthesis of neuroimaging findings increasingly difficult. The goal of this project is to develop an automated software platform for large-scale synthesis of human functional neuroimaging studies. Our work builds directly on an existing software platform (NeuroSynth) and involves key extensions and improvements that focus on (i) aggregation, (ii) coding, (iii) synthesis, and (iv) sharing of functional neuroimaging data. In Aim 1, we will use computational linguistics and bioinformatics data mining techniques to develop new algorithms for automatically extracting activation foci and associated metadata from published neuroimaging articles. In Aim 2, we will use topic-modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Analysis in combination with existing cognitive ontologies such as the Cognitive Atlas to develop structured representations of automatically extracted neuroimaging data. In Aim 3, we will improve the meta-analysis and classification capacities of our existing platform by implementing a state-of- the-art hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis method recently developed by the research team. Finally, in Aim 4, we will develop a state-of-the-art web interface (://neurosynth.org) that supports real-time, in-browser access to the data, results, and tools produced in Aims 1 - 3. Realizing these objectives will introduce powerful new tools for organizing and synthesizing the neuroimaging literature on an unprecedented scale. These tools will be freely and publicly available to anyone with an internet connection, enabling rapid and efficient application to a broad range of clinical and basic research applications.          Functional neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI have opened a new frontier in efforts to investigate and understand the neural mechanisms of normal and abnormal cognition. However, the rapidly expanding scope of the literature makes distillation and synthesis of brain imaging findings increasingly challenging. The goal of this project is to develop a new software platform for automated aggregation, synthesis, and sharing of published neuroimaging results, with the potential to advance understanding of mechanisms underlying mental health disorders.

"CRCNS: Hybrid non-invasive brain-machine interfaces for 3D object manipulation Interacting with the physical environment and manipulating objects is an essential part of daily life. This ability is lost in upper-limb amputees as well as patients with spinal cord injury, stroke, ALS and other movement disorders. These people know what they want to do as well as how they would do it if their arms were functional. If such knowledge is decoded and sent to a prosthetic arm (or to the patient's own arm fitted with functional electric stimulators) the lost motor function could be restored. The decoding is unlikely to be perfect however the brain can adapt to an imperfect decoder using real-time feedback. Several groups including ours have recently demonstrated that at least in principle this can be achieved. However, as is often the case in science, the initial work has been done in idealized conditions and its applicability to real-world usage scenarios remains an open question. The goal of this project is to bring movement control brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) closer to helping the people who need them, and at the same time exploit the rich datasets we collect in order to advance our understanding of sensorimotor control and learning. This will be accomplished by creating hybrid BMIs which exploit information from multiple sources, combined with modern algorithms from machine learning and automatic control. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Being able to interact with the physical environment and manipulate objects is an essential part of daily life.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.

"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Pattern Analysis of Large-Scale Functional Connectivity in SAD The current proposal is aimed at developing a novel neurobiological marker based on patterns of whole-brain functional connectivity during implicit and subliminal threat-related facial emotion perception to aid the diagnosis and assessment of treatment response in social anxiety (SAD) and panic disorder (PD). The following Specific Aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1). Develop, apply and validate an approach to estimate the large-scale functional networks of implicit and subliminal threat-related and ambiguous facial emotion processing in a healthy control subject pool. We will perform this by first testing whether large-scale partial correlations measured during a particular condition (i.e. presentation of visible or invisible fearful and neutral faces) can be used as features to predict the stimulus type presented during the condition (Sub-aim 1a). We will then test whether the most informative features for predicting fearful vs. neutral face conditions are connections among primarily limbic and paralimbic nodes, and that the most informative features in predicting neutral vs. resting states conditions are connections among primarily attention, motor and sensory related regions (Sub-aim 1b). Specific Aim 2). Determine whether the approach developed in SA1 may have potential clinical application towards the diagnosis and treatment of SAD and PD. We will perform this by testing whether the above functional networks are informative brain signatures that can be used to discriminate between healthy controls, SAD and PD subjects (Sub-aim 2a). We will also test whether the approach can be used to determine the particular sub-networks that are aberrant in SAD and PD (Sub-aim 2b). PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed approach may contribute toward the development of effective biomarkers in the diagnosis of SAD and PD. It may also identify the functional connections whose patterns differ between control and SAD, control and PD, and SAD and PD. This would contribute to our understanding of and aid in the development of therapies for these distinct anxiety disorders.",Pattern Analysis of Large-Scale Functional Connectivity in SAD,8262402,F31MH088104,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Panic Disorder', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perception', 'Population Control', 'Process', 'Rest', 'Sensory', 'Social Controls', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical application', 'disorder control', 'improved', 'novel', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'therapy development', 'treatment response']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2012,38180,-0.028223457907542746
"Action for Health in Diabetes Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ancillary Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preservation of brain health is a critical goal in the care of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who are at increased risk for atrophy, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. Weight loss and increased physical activity hold promise as potentially effective strategies for this purpose, but are currently unproven in any population. Because unintended weight loss often precedes declines in later life brain health, a randomized controlled clinical trial is necessary, which must feature an effective behavioral intervention that is sustained over a long period of time in a large well characterized cohort. Mounting such a program de novo would be very expensive. Instead, we propose to make use of the ongoing and very successful Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) randomized controlled clinical trial, adding cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to its extensive data collection protocol. This is feasible: participants in clinical trials have been repeatedly shown to be willing to join brain imaging studies and we have developed successful protocols for maintaining safety, confidentiality, and quality. This is novel: Look AHEAD and the state-of-the-art MRI protocols that we propose provide an unprecedented opportunity to assess the long-term effectiveness of mid-life behavioral changes on brain structure and function and to advance understanding of brain health in diabetes. We address an important public health priority for a rapidly growing and under-studied segment of the US population in a cost-effective manner, leveraging the extensive research resources available from Look AHEAD. We respond to PAR-09-247, which targets ancillary study applications to major NIDDK clinical trials, including Look AHEAD. We will enroll 496 participants, ages 55-85 years with type 2 diabetes, from 3 Look AHEAD clinics. They will have been randomly assigned 10 years ago when they were obese or overweight, with equal probability, to either an ongoing intensive lifestyle intervention that has induced sustained weight loss and increased physical activity or control condition (diabetes support and education) that has fostered excellent retention. A proven protocol for standardized structural MRI will provide regional brain and ischemic lesion volumes; functional MRI will provide assessments of functional activation, resting state connectivity, and cerebral blood flow. A tested cognitive battery and physical activity assessment will be administered. A comprehensive analysis of these data will make use of established statistical approaches and novel machine-learning methods. Look AHEAD provides extensive 10-year characterizations of participant's health and behavior, their medical care and its cost, and the trial's interventions; state-of-the art data management systems; and provisions for developing public access databases.

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification.

"Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing structure-function correlations is fundamental to understanding how information is processed in the central nervous system (CNS). Axonal connectivity is a key relationship that facilitates information transmission and reception within the CNS. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) methods have been shown to provide fundamental information required for viewing structural connectivity and have allowed visualization of fiber bundles in the CNS in vivo. In this project, we propose to develop methods for extraction and analysis of these patterns from high angular resolution diffusion weighted images (HARDI) that is known to have better resolving power over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, a biologically relevant and clinically important model has been chosen to study changes in the organization of fibers in the intact and injured spinal cord. Our hypothesis is that, changes in geometrical properties of the anatomical substrate, identifying the region of injury and neuroplastic changes in distant spinal segments, correlate with different magnitudes of injury and levels of locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Prior to hypothesis testing, we will denoise the HARDI data and then construct a normal atlas cord. Deformable registration and tensor morphometry between a normal atlas and an injured cord would be performed to provide a distinct signature for each type of behavior recovery associated with the SCI substrate. Validation of the hypothesis will be performed through systematic histological analysis of cord samples following acquisition of the HARDI data. Spinal cords will be cut and stained with fiber and cell stains to verify changes in anatomical organization that result from contusive injury (common in humans as well) to the spinal cord. A comparison between anatomical characteristics obtained from histological versus HARDI analysis will provide validation for the image analysis and the hypothesis. Three severities of spinal cord injuries will be produced (light, mild and moderate contusions) based upon normed injury device parameters. The structural signatures of these labeled data subsets will then be identified. Automatic classification of novel & injured cord HARDI data sets will then be achieved using a large margin classifier. Finally, HARDI data acquired over time will be analyzed in order to learn and predict the level of locomotor recovery by studying the structural changes over time and developing a dynamic model of structural transformations corresponding to each chosen class. We will use an auto-regressive model in the feature space to track and predict structural changes in SCI and correlate it to functional recovery.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Diffusion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies. Although the various algorithms developed here are for analysis of SCI, they can be used in other applications such as traumatic brain injury, in tracking and predicting developmental changes etc. from diffusion MRI scans.                 Narrative This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Di(R)usion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.  The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.

"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving  Project Summary Abstract This proposal aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effets of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding). The developmental and experimental elements of this proposal will lead to new avenues for treatment that would be readily generalizable to other forms of drug addiction besides nicotine, and potentially impacting on the outcomes of the substantial numbers of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment.  Project Narrative The development of new methodology for the treatment of patients with substance use disorders would represent a significant advance in the theraputics of these disorders. The studies proposed offer a new treatment alternative for these otherwise highly recurrent and chronic illnesses.",Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving,8282904,R33DA026077,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Auditory area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Insula of Reil', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Opiates', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Placebo Control', 'Placebo Effect', 'Placebos', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recurrence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reproducibility', 'Sampling', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Spin Labels', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance of Abuse', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'addiction', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cingulate cortex', 'craving', 'expectation', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurofeedback', 'nicotine craving', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'substance abuse treatment', 'vector', 'visual feedback', 'visual motor', 'volunteer']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R33,2012,533133,0.016665577055325207
"Integrating Multimodal Brain Imaging Data to Assess Subtle Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional neuroimaging studies of the human brain have become increasingly important in the understanding of normal and pathological processes of cognition. Sophisticated statistical analytic frameworks have been developed to locate signal change and define brain networks involved in various tasks. However, in subtle cognitive impairment-e.g., exposure-related illness, early stages of degenerative diseases, injury, secondary illness following adjuvant therapy for cancer-these methods tend to have low sensitivity for detecting small changes in brain states resulting from mild brain dysfunction. An understanding of disease mechanism or progression of subtle cognitive dysfunction requires a novel statistical analytic framework with improved sensitivity to measure small changes in brain states. We have developed an innovative methodology that we successfully applied in measures of regional cerebral blood flow experiments. These methods use well established spatial modeling procedures, new to the functional brain imaging field, to derive statistically optimal spatial summaries within effective resolution groups or ""kriging"", shown by preliminary studies to improve signal detection sensitivity and mitigate the multiple testing burden. Within this new spatial modeling framework, we propose to extend the kriging methodology to fMRI and EEG, modify existing techniques for characterizing brain networks of connectivity (e.g., kriging-based independent components analysis), and integrate the imaging modalities using a statistical classifier based on derived inputs of data driven effective resolution groups. Our primary goal is to develop this analysis framework to provide insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of mild cognitive dysfunction. Achieving this goal may suggest treatments to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, or at minimum, provide an informed clinical management of cognitively impaired patients.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages. Causes range from traumatic injury to toxin exposures, including chemotherapy for cancer treatment, to degenerative diseases. Mechanisms of damage or disease remain difficult to establish using current methods in functional brain imaging studies due to an inability to measure very small changes in brain states. We propose a new analytic framework using existing technology to improve the ability to measure subtle changes important in the understanding of disease pathology of impaired cognition and to greatly facilitate the integration of information from several imaging modalities with potential implications for clinical management and treatment.              Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia. In silico hit compounds will be experimentally validated and enter hit-to-lead optimization.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.

"Large-scale Automated Synthesis of Functional Neuroimaging Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosive growth of the human neuroimaging literature has led to major advances in understanding of normal and abnormal human brain function, but has also made aggregation and synthesis of neuroimaging findings increasingly difficult. The goal of this project is to develop an automated software platform for large-scale synthesis of human functional neuroimaging studies. Our work builds directly on an existing software platform (NeuroSynth) and involves key extensions and improvements that focus on (i) aggregation, (ii) coding, (iii) synthesis, and (iv) sharing of functional neuroimaging data. In Aim 1, we will use computational linguistics and bioinformatics data mining techniques to develop new algorithms for automatically extracting activation foci and associated metadata from published neuroimaging articles. In Aim 2, we will use topic-modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Analysis in combination with existing cognitive ontologies such as the Cognitive Atlas to develop structured representations of automatically extracted neuroimaging data. In Aim 3, we will improve the meta-analysis and classification capacities of our existing platform by implementing a state-of- the-art hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis method recently developed by the research team. Finally, in Aim 4, we will develop a state-of-the-art web interface (://neurosynth.org) that supports real-time, in-browser access to the data, results, and tools produced in Aims 1 - 3. Realizing these objectives will introduce powerful new tools for organizing and synthesizing the neuroimaging literature on an unprecedented scale. These tools will be freely and publicly available to anyone with an internet connection, enabling rapid and efficient application to a broad range of clinical and basic research applications.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI have opened a new frontier in efforts to investigate and understand the neural mechanisms of normal and abnormal cognition.

"Independent Component Analysis Based Support Vector Machine Classification Method    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional MRI (fMRI) techniques have provided the addiction field with a unique and profoundly valuable ability to explore brain mechanisms in human subjects. Despite the resultant advances in our understanding of neural mechanisms, the diagnostic utility of neuroimaging methods has not been realized. In addition, our ability to assess the reactivity of neural networks over time remains limited. To explore new approaches to further our understanding and diagnosis of substance use disorders, this proposal will utilize novel and powerful analytic methods to assess an existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set in cocaine-addicted subjects and healthy controls. The PI, new to the substance abuse field, will bring analytic approaches developed in other areas of investigation to the field of addiction. The broad goal of this project is to examine differentiations of brain functions in cocaine-addicted subjects using fMRI data and to reveal functional connectivity between regions involving disinhibition and decision-making tasks. This study will exploit data from an ongoing NIDA-funded study, ""Impulsivity, Neural Deficits and Cocaine Addiction."" This study assesses BOLD response during a motor disinhibition task and a decision- making task of response reversal as well as basal measures of interconnectivity measures during rest. A data driven entropy-based algorithm, independent component analysis (ICA), will be used to extract spatially independent regions that show differences in addicted and control subjects (Aim 1). We hypothesize that the proposed method will identify certain groups of voxels (not necessarily spatially connected) serving separation of two groups who are under disinhibition and decision-making tasks. To uncover how the functional connectivity changes over time between those differentiated regions, we will perform dynamic (changes over short time) dynamic functional network connectivity (DFNC) analysis using various window sizes on time course (Aim 2). These findings are expected to reveal a temporal distinction between ICA-derived network changes in cocaine-addicted and healthy control populations. Since the first aim will find significantly discriminative clouds of voxels, we will use a machine-learning algorithm, the support vector machines (SVM), to automatically map a subject into one of the groups, cocaine-addicted or control, by using subject's fMRI data (Aim 3). We hypothesize that SVM based subject classification tool will provide high sensitivity in selection between the two groups. The framework potentially offers a useful clinical diagnostic instrument as well as demonstrating key brain neural differences between the groups. The last aim is designed to reveal dynamic connectivity between pairs of given anatomic regions of relevance, such as the mesial prefrontal cortex (PFC), inferior PFC, insular cortex, and anterior cingulate (for the disinhibition task) and the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate (for the decision-making task). We hypothesize that a clear boundary will be observed in interaction patterns of two groups regarding two tasks. The contrast between brain regions in fMRI data of cocaine-addicted and control subjects will be investigated for the first time using very powerful data analysis tool (ICA) and will be used in classification framework of SVM. The proposal will bring together two extremely innovative techniques (DFNC and SVM) and a promising junior investigator into the field of addiction. The utilization of a pre-existing database offers a highly cost-effective approach to a clinically important, perplexing and persistent problem in the field.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The abuse and dependence of stimulants is a major public health problem with significant health, legal, social and occupational associated costs. While biologically-oriented studies, particularly those using imaging techniques, have produced significant advances in our understanding of brain activity relevant to the development and persistence of addiction, this knowledge has done little to assist in the diagnosis of these disorders. This study will bring statistical procedures used in other fields of research to imaging data obtained from cocaine-addicted subjects to assess changes in brain networks and determine whether the cocaine-addicted patients can be distinguished from non-cocaine using subjects.            The abuse and dependence of stimulants is a major public health problem with significant health, legal, social and occupational associated costs.

"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics. Algorithms that consider multiple genetic variants jointly, we propose, are likely to (1) more powerfully detect new gene effects on brain images, and (2) identify profiles of candidate genetic variants to assist prediction of an individual's brain integrity and risk for disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability across the world.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.

"Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and related electroencephalography (EEG) use an array of sensors to non-invasively measure electromagnetic (EM) fields produced by synchronous current activity within the brain. While the temporal resolution is excellent relative to other functional imaging modalities, accurately localizing in 3D space the sources of brain activity involves solving a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. Existing localization methods used clinically and for research purposes maintain significant shortcomings, including the inability to resolve complex source configurations, bias caused by source correlations, and sensitivity to sources of noise and interference. The latter can arise from eye blinks, heart beats, sensor imperfections, and industrial noise as well as from spontaneous background brain activity not associated with the brain sources of interest. Additionally, prototype algorithms ostensibly designed to deal with some of these issues are heuristic in nature and have not been rigorously evaluated or compared, making their ultimate utility difficult to assess for neuroelectromagnetic imaging practitioners. The proposed research plan addresses all of these concerns by developing a principled localization scheme that unifies and extends existing localization strategies using modern concepts from Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Based on the notion of automatic relevance determination (ARD), brain regions with probable (relevant) activity are located with high spatial resolution. Interference sources are effectively removed by integrating with a variation factor analysis model. To quantify the improvement afforded by the proposed methodology, source location estimates will be compared with standard algorithms using realistic simulations, near-ground-truth data obtained from invasive electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings, and surgical data. The result will be implemented as a user-friendly localization toolbox and made freely available to the community by integrating with existing open-source functional brain imaging software. Non-invasive mapping of brain activity with high spatio-temporal resolution has important consequences for basic neuroscience studies of human cognition. It also has profound implications for the diagnosis, characterization and treatment of various neurological, neurooncological, mental health, developmental, and communication disorders. For example, localizations of brain sources are used to map cognitive function in epileptogenic areas and in neighboring brain regions. Such brain mapping procedures are then useful to guide neurosurgical planning, navigation, and resection and to minimize post-operative deficits.           n/a",Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones,7942859,F32NS061395,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic pedigree', 'heuristics', 'human CYP2B6 protein', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'operation', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2011,19755,-0.0034913560238889175
"Pattern analysis of large-scale functional connectivity to predict implicit emoti The current proposal is aimed at developing a novel neurobiological marker based on patterns of whole-brain functional connectivity during implicit and subliminal threat-related facial emotion perception to aid the diagnosis and assessment of treatment response in social anxiety (SAD) and panic disorder (PD). The following Specific Aims are proposed:    Specific Aim 1). Develop, apply and validate an approach to estimate the large-scale functional networks of implicit and subliminal threat-related and ambiguous facial emotion processing in a healthy control subject pool.    We will perform this by first testing whether large-scale partial correlations measured during a particular condition (i.e. presentation of visible or invisible fearful and neutral faces) can be used as features to predict the stimulus type presented during the condition (Sub-aim 1a). We will then test whether the most informative features for predicting fearful vs. neutral face conditions are connections among primarily limbic and paralimbic nodes, and that the most informative features in predicting neutral vs. resting states conditions are connections among primarily attention, motor and sensory related regions (Sub-aim 1b).    Specific Aim 2). Determine whether the approach developed in SA1 may have potential clinical application towards the diagnosis and treatment of SAD and PD.    We will perform this by testing whether the above functional networks are informative brain signatures that can be used to discriminate between healthy controls, SAD and PD subjects (Sub-aim 2a). We will also test whether the approach can be used to determine the particular sub-networks that are aberrant in SAD and PD (Sub-aim 2b). PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed approach may contribute toward the development of effective biomarkers in the diagnosis of SAD and PD. It may also identify the functional connections whose patterns differ between control and SAD, control and PD, and SAD and PD.

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification. Together, these studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of brain connectivity and brain activity in autism, and set the direction for my future career.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism. This will be important information for guiding future diagnoses and intervention.              These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism.

"Action for Health in Diabetes Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ancillary Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preservation of brain health is a critical goal in the care of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who are at increased risk for atrophy, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. Weight loss and increased physical activity hold promise as potentially effective strategies for this purpose, but are currently unproven in any population. Because unintended weight loss often precedes declines in later life brain health, a randomized controlled clinical trial is necessary, which must feature an effective behavioral intervention that is sustained over a long period of time in a large well characterized cohort. Mounting such a program de novo would be very expensive. Instead, we propose to make use of the ongoing and very successful Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) randomized controlled clinical trial, adding cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to its extensive data collection protocol. This is feasible: participants in clinical trials have been repeatedly shown to be willing to join brain imaging studies and we have developed successful protocols for maintaining safety, confidentiality, and quality. This is novel: Look AHEAD and the state-of-the-art MRI protocols that we propose provide an unprecedented opportunity to assess the long-term effectiveness of mid-life behavioral changes on brain structure and function and to advance understanding of brain health in diabetes. We address an important public health priority for a rapidly growing and under-studied segment of the US population in a cost-effective manner, leveraging the extensive research resources available from Look AHEAD. We respond to PAR-09-247, which targets ancillary study applications to major NIDDK clinical trials, including Look AHEAD.  We will enroll 496 participants, ages 55-85 years with type 2 diabetes, from 3 Look AHEAD clinics. They will have been randomly assigned 10 years ago when they were obese or overweight, with equal probability, to either an ongoing intensive lifestyle intervention that has induced sustained weight loss and increased physical activity or control condition (diabetes support and education) that has fostered excellent retention. A proven protocol for standardized structural MRI will provide regional brain and ischemic lesion volumes; functional MRI will provide assessments of functional activation, resting state connectivity, and cerebral blood flow. A tested cognitive battery and physical activity assessment will be administered. A comprehensive analysis of these data will make use of established statistical approaches and novel machine-learning methods. Look AHEAD provides extensive 10-year characterizations of participant's health and behavior, their medical care and its cost, and the trial's interventions; state-of-the art data management systems; and provisions for developing public access databases.

"Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing structure-function correlations is fundamental to understanding how information is processed in the central nervous system (CNS). Axonal connectivity is a key relationship that facilitates information transmission and reception within the CNS. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) methods have been shown to provide fundamental information required for viewing structural connectivity and have allowed visualization of fiber bundles in the CNS in vivo. In this project, we propose to develop methods for extraction and analysis of these patterns from high angular resolution diffusion weighted images (HARDI) that is known to have better resolving power over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, a biologically relevant and clinically important model has been chosen to study changes in the organization of fibers in the intact and injured spinal cord. Our hypothesis is that, changes in geometrical properties of the anatomical substrate, identifying the region of injury and neuroplastic changes in distant spinal segments, correlate with different magnitudes of injury and levels of locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Prior to hypothesis testing, we will denoise the HARDI data and then construct a normal atlas cord. Deformable registration and tensor morphometry between a normal atlas and an injured cord would be performed to provide a distinct signature for each type of behavior recovery associated with the SCI substrate. Validation of the hypothesis will be performed through systematic histological analysis of cord samples following acquisition of the HARDI data. Spinal cords will be cut and stained with fiber and cell stains to verify changes in anatomical organization that result from contusive injury (common in humans as well) to the spinal cord. A comparison between anatomical characteristics obtained from histological versus HARDI analysis will provide validation for the image analysis and the hypothesis. Three severities of spinal cord injuries will be produced (light, mild and moderate contusions) based upon normed injury device parameters. The structural signatures of these labeled data subsets will then be identified. Automatic classification of novel & injured cord HARDI data sets will then be achieved using a large margin classifier. Finally, HARDI data acquired over time will be analyzed in order to learn and predict the level of locomotor recovery by studying the structural changes over time and developing a dynamic model of structural transformations corresponding to each chosen class. We will use an auto-regressive model in the feature space to track and predict structural changes in SCI and correlate it to functional recovery.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Diffusion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.

"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effects of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding). The developmental and experimental elements of this application will lead to new avenues for treatment that would be readily generalizable to other forms of drug addiction besides nicotine, and potentially impacting on the outcomes of the substantial numbers of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of new methodology for the treatment of patients with substance use disorders would represent a significant advance in the therapeutics of these disorders.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.",Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging,8137829,K25AG033725,"['Adult', 'Aerobic', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'aging mind', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'healthy aging', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'morphometry', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'relational memory', 'research study', 'response', 'sedentary', 'shape analysis', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,K25,2011,150833,0.02735020124291281
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",8116049,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,U01,2011,437768,-0.04151763573231833
"Biological and Information Processing Mechanisms Underlying Autism This center focuses on elucidating fundamental information processing and neurobiological mechanisms causing autism. It incorporates 5 themes: 1) autism as a disorder of complex information processing abilities WITH intact or enhanced basic abilities; 2) autism as a disturbance in cerebral connectivity with under connectivity of long-distance connections and over-connectivity of compensatory local connections; 3) autism as a developmental disorder whose brain-behavioral manifestations change with each stage of brain maturation from childhood to adulthood; 4) that the pathognomonic social impairments are best understood in terms of underlying information processing mechanisms; and 5) that emotional and affective impairments are a major component of the syndrome and significant contributor to impaired function and serious behavior issues. These goals will be addressed using behavioral, cognitive, fMRI, DTI, DTT, and neuropathologic studies of: infant siblings, first-diagnosed toddlers with autism, and groups of children, adolescents, and adults with and without autism. Project I: Development of Categorization & Facial Knowledge in Low & High Functioning Autism; Project II: Disturbances of Affective Contact: Development of Brain Mechanisms for Emotion Processing; Project III: Systems Connectivity & Brain Activation: Imaging Studies of Language & Perception; Project IV: Diffusion Tensor MRI & Histopathology of Brain Microstructure & Fiber Pathways. Project I focuses on understanding the earliest manifestations of autism and the development of earlier diagnostic tools; it also focuses on information processing mechanisms underlying social and cognitive symptoms. Project II focuses on elucidating emotion processing mechanisms and the maturational disturbances from childhood through adulthood; these studies will clarify how individuals with autism experience, understand and regulate emotion, and will also examine their self-awareness of emotion. Genetic modifiers of emotionality will also be determined. Project III focuses on understanding disturbances in functional brain connectivity that underlie the impaired processing of information and in turn the cognitive and behavioral impairments in autism. The project also includes innovative machine-learning studies of how the brain identifies and categorizes words and computational modeling of cortical function. Project IV looks at structural connectivity of specific white matter pathways and the histopathology of intra-cortical white matter projections. This project will help reconcile the functional under-connectivity and early structural overgrowth in autism. The identification of fundamental information processing mechanisms underlying the behavior of autism will lead to the development of more specific and effective interventions; similarly identification of connectivity alterations can lead to targeted cognitive interventions that increase neural connectivity.

"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7761665,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'addiction', 'adverse outcome', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2010,214701,0.022318840964176728
"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.

"Advanced methods for lesion-symptom mapping in aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesion analysis plays a central role in cognitive neuroscience, complementing functional activation studies by identifying brain regions that are necessary for the performance of particular functions.

"Transmission of Information in the Visual System How do we identify an object from the features that we detect? Understanding how the brain recognizes objects might give insight into how the brain solves problems in general. The object recognition problem has withstood a century of attempts, but we bring new tools ¿ fruits of the last grant period ¿ that allow us to sketch the outlines of a solution. Four approaches, all new and different, converge on one answer. AIM 1. Use crowding, along with other manipulations, to characterize three parallel processes in reading by normal and dyslexic readers. AIM 2. Count features by probability summation. Extending traditional probability summation from explaining just detection to also explain object identification, we acquire a new tool, allowing us to count the number of features the observer must detect in order to identify. AIM 3. Capture the observer's classification algorithm by computer modeling of the observer's responses to thousands of letters in white noise. We use statistical learning theory to build a classifier that accounts for human performance. The observer classifies each of several thousand images of a letter in noise as ""a"", ""b"", or ""c"", etc. These classifications are data that can tell us what the observer is doing. We use a powerful statistical learning algorithm to create a simple classifier that best models human performance. AIM 4. fMRI: Where in the brain are letters identified? Correlate the activation of the ""letter"" area in the left fusiform gyrus, and elsewhere, with two psychophysically-discovered signatures of letter identification: fast learning and channel frequency. Thus techniques from cognition, perception, statistical learning theory, and physiology together will reveal what is computed where, in the brain, when an observer identifies an object. n/a",Transmission of Information in the Visual System,7765534,R01EY004432,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Frequencies', 'Fruit', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Noise', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Schools', 'Solutions', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'detector', 'insight', 'object recognition', 'parallel processing', 'peripheral reading', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,324963,0.009253171075895539
"Automated Assessment of Structural Changes & Functional Recovery Post Spinal Inju    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing structure-function correlations is fundamental to understanding how information is processed in the central nervous system (CNS). Axonal connectivity is a key relationship that facilitates information transmission and reception within the CNS. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) methods have been shown to provide fundamental information required for viewing structural connectivity and have allowed visualization of fiber bundles in the CNS in vivo. In this project, we propose to develop methods for extraction and analysis of these patterns from high angular resolution diffusion weighted images (HARDI) that is known to have better resolving power over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To this end, a biologically relevant and clinically important model has been chosen to study changes in the organization of fibers in the intact and injured spinal cord. Our hypothesis is that, changes in geometrical properties of the anatomical substrate, identifying the region of injury and neuroplastic changes in distant spinal segments, correlate with different magnitudes of injury and levels of locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Prior to hypothesis testing, we will denoise the HARDI data and then construct a normal atlas cord. Deformable registration and tensor morphometry between a normal atlas and an injured cord would be performed to provide a distinct signature for each type of behavior recovery associated with the SCI substrate. Validation of the hypothesis will be performed through systematic histological analysis of cord samples following acquisition of the HARDI data. Spinal cords will be cut and stained with fiber and cell stains to verify changes in anatomical organization that result from contusive injury (common in humans as well) to the spinal cord. A comparison between anatomical characteristics obtained from histological versus HARDI analysis will provide validation for the image analysis and the hypothesis. Three severities of spinal cord injuries will be produced (light, mild and moderate contusions) based upon normed injury device parameters. The structural signatures of these labeled data subsets will then be identified. Automatic classification of novel & injured cord HARDI data sets will then be achieved using a large margin classifier. Finally, HARDI data acquired over time will be analyzed in order to learn and predict the level of locomotor recovery by studying the structural changes over time and developing a dynamic model of structural transformations corresponding to each chosen class. We will use an auto-regressive model in the feature space to track and predict structural changes in SCI and correlate it to functional recovery.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Diffusion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies. Although the various algorithms developed here are for analysis of SCI, they can be used in other applications such as traumatic brain injury, in tracking and predicting developmental changes etc. from diffusion MRI scans.                 Narrative This project involves the development of automated methods to extract morphological signatures that characterize changes in spinal cord injury (SCI) substrate estimated from Di(R)usion MRI scans of rats, and predict the functional recovery by correlating to behavioral studies.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.

"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effects of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding). The developmental and experimental elements of this application will lead to new avenues for treatment that would be readily generalizable to other forms of drug addiction besides nicotine, and potentially impacting on the outcomes of the substantial numbers of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of new methodology for the treatment of patients with substance use disorders would represent a significant advance in the therapeutics of these disorders. The studies proposed offer a new treatment alternative for these otherwise highly recurrent and chronic illnesses.           Project Narrative The development of new methodology for the treatment of patients with substance use disorders would represent a significant advance in the theraputics of these disorders.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.",Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging,7989936,K25AG033725,"['Adult', 'Aerobic', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'aging mind', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'morphometry', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'relational memory', 'research study', 'response', 'sedentary', 'shape analysis', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,K25,2010,150781,0.02735020124291281
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data.

"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data.

"Biological and Information Processing Mechanisms Underlying Autism This center focuses on elucidating fundamental information processing and neurobiological mechanisms causing autism. It incorporates 5 themes: 1) autism as a disorder of complex information processing abilities WITH intact or enhanced basic abilities; 2) autism as a disturbance in cerebral connectivity with under connectivity of long-distance connections and over-connectivity of compensatory local connections; 3) autism as a developmental disorder whose brain-behavioral manifestations change with each stage of brain maturation from childhood to adulthood; 4) that the pathognomonic social impairments are best understood in terms of underlying information processing mechanisms; and 5) that emotional and affective impairments are a major component of the syndrome and significant contributor to impaired function and serious behavior issues. These goals will be addressed using behavioral, cognitive, fMRI, DTI, DTT, and neuropathologic studies of: infant siblings, first-diagnosed toddlers with autism, and groups of children, adolescents, and adults with and without autism. Project I: Development of Categorization & Facial Knowledge in Low & High Functioning Autism; Project II: Disturbances of Affective Contact: Development of Brain Mechanisms for Emotion Processing; Project III: Systems Connectivity & Brain Activation: Imaging Studies of Language & Perception; Project IV: Diffusion Tensor MRI & Histopathology of Brain Microstructure & Fiber Pathways. Project I focuses on understanding the earliest manifestations of autism and the development of earlier diagnostic tools; it also focuses on information processing mechanisms underlying social and cognitive symptoms. Project II focuses on elucidating emotion processing mechanisms and the maturational disturbances from childhood through adulthood; these studies will clarify how individuals with autism experience, understand and regulate emotion, and will also examine their self-awareness of emotion. Genetic modifiers of emotionality will also be determined. Project III focuses on understanding disturbances in functional brain connectivity that underlie the impaired processing of information and in turn the cognitive and behavioral impairments in autism. The project also includes innovative machine-learning studies of how the brain identifies and categorizes words and computational modeling of cortical function. Project IV looks at structural connectivity of specific white matter pathways and the histopathology of intra-cortical white matter projections. This project will help reconcile the functional under-connectivity and early structural overgrowth in autism. The identification of fundamental information processing mechanisms underlying the behavior of autism will lead to the development of more specific and effective interventions; similarly identification of connectivity alterations can lead to targeted cognitive interventions that increase neural connectivity.

"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD. n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7900037,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'meetings', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure', 'web site']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2010,242586,-0.04525698585830819
"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7599700,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'addiction', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2009,216795,0.022318840964176728
"Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and related electroencephalography (EEG) use an array of sensors to non-invasively measure electromagnetic (EM) fields produced by synchronous current activity within the brain. While the temporal resolution is excellent relative to other functional imaging modalities, accurately localizing in 3D space the sources of brain activity involves solving a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. Existing localization methods used clinically and for research purposes maintain significant shortcomings, including the inability to resolve complex source configurations, bias caused by source correlations, and sensitivity to sources of noise and interference. The latter can arise from eye blinks, heart beats, sensor imperfections, and industrial noise as well as from spontaneous background brain activity not associated with the brain sources of interest. Additionally, prototype algorithms ostensibly designed to deal with some of these issues are heuristic in nature and have not been rigorously evaluated or compared, making their ultimate utility difficult to assess for neuroelectromagnetic imaging practitioners. The proposed research plan addresses all of these concerns by developing a principled localization scheme that unifies and extends existing localization strategies using modern concepts from Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Based on the notion of automatic relevance determination (ARD), brain regions with probable (relevant) activity are located with high spatial resolution. Interference sources are effectively removed by integrating with a variation factor analysis model. To quantify the improvement afforded by the proposed methodology, source location estimates will be compared with standard algorithms using realistic simulations, near-ground-truth data obtained from invasive electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings, and surgical data. The result will be implemented as a user-friendly localization toolbox and made freely available to the community by integrating with existing open-source functional brain imaging software. Non-invasive mapping of brain activity with high spatio-temporal resolution has important consequences for basic neuroscience studies of human cognition. It also has profound implications for the diagnosis, characterization and treatment of various neurological, neurooncological, mental health, developmental, and communication disorders. For example, localizations of brain sources are used to map cognitive function in epileptogenic areas and in neighboring brain regions. Such brain mapping procedures are then useful to guide neurosurgical planning, navigation, and resection and to minimize post-operative deficits.           n/a",Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones,7751495,F32NS061395,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Electromagnetics', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nutmeg - dietary', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic pedigree', 'heuristics', 'human CYP2B6 protein', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2009,46257,-0.0034913560238889175
"Transmission of Information in the Visual System How do we identify an object from the features that we detect? Understanding how the brain recognizes objects might give insight into how the brain solves problems in general. The object recognition problem has withstood a century of attempts, but we bring new tools ¿ fruits of the last grant period ¿ that allow us to sketch the outlines of a solution. Four approaches, all new and different, converge on one answer. AIM 1. Use crowding, along with other manipulations, to characterize three parallel processes in reading by normal and dyslexic readers. AIM 2. Count features by probability summation. Extending traditional probability summation from explaining just detection to also explain object identification, we acquire a new tool, allowing us to count the number of features the observer must detect in order to identify. AIM 3. Capture the observer's classification algorithm by computer modeling of the observer's responses to thousands of letters in white noise. We use statistical learning theory to build a classifier that accounts for human performance. The observer classifies each of several thousand images of a letter in noise as ""a"", ""b"", or ""c"", etc. These classifications are data that can tell us what the observer is doing. We use a powerful statistical learning algorithm to create a simple classifier that best models human performance. AIM 4. fMRI: Where in the brain are letters identified? Correlate the activation of the ""letter"" area in the left fusiform gyrus, and elsewhere, with two psychophysically-discovered signatures of letter identification: fast learning and channel frequency.

"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effects of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding). The developmental and experimental elements of this application will lead to new avenues for treatment that would be readily generalizable to other forms of drug addiction besides nicotine, and potentially impacting on the outcomes of the substantial numbers of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of new methodology for the treatment of patients with substance use disorders would represent a significant advance in the therapeutics of these disorders.

While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7668683,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2009,488655,-0.04151763573231833
"Biological and Information Processing Mechanisms Underlying Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This center focuses on elucidating fundamental information processing and neurobiological mechanisms causing autism. It incorporates 5 themes: 1) autism as a disorder of complex information processing abilities WITH intact or enhanced basic abilities; 2) autism as a disturbance in cerebral connectivity with under connectivity of long-distance connections and over-connectivity of compensatory local connections; 3) autism as a developmental disorder whose brain-behavioral manifestations change with each stage of brain maturation from childhood to adulthood; 4) that the pathognomonic social impairments are best understood in terms of underlying information processing mechanisms; and 5) that emotional and affective impairments are a major component of the syndrome and significant contributor to impaired function and serious behavior issues. These goals will be addressed using behavioral, cognitive, fMRI, DTI, DTT, and neuropathologic studies of: infant siblings, first-diagnosed toddlers with autism, and groups of children, adolescents, and adults with and without autism.

Project I focuses on understanding the earliest manifestations of autism and the development of earlier diagnostic tools; it also focuses on information processing mechanisms underlying social and cognitive symptoms. Project II focuses on elucidating emotion processing mechanisms and the maturational disturbances from childhood through adulthood; these studies will clarify how individuals with autism experience, understand and regulate emotion, and will also examine their self-awareness of emotion.

"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7668689,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'meetings', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure', 'web site']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2009,237539,-0.04525698585830819
"Massively Parallel Brain Imaging  I propose a disruptive technology that will revolutionize our understanding of brain function, development, and disease. Because the study of neural circuits remains deeply limited by a paucity of data, we need massively parallel approaches to brain imaging that will raise data acquisition rates by over two orders of magnitude. High-throughput technologies have already revolutionized certain areas of biology such as genomics and proteomics, but neuroscience has yet to experience a growth spurt of comparable magnitude. I will construct instrumentation allowing the brain volumes of ~100 alert flies to be imaged simultaneously by two-photon fluorescence microscopy. I have chosen the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, because of its small brain, its sophisticated behavioral repertoire, the large number of strains with genetically targeted alterations to brain circuitry, the utility of fluorescence imaging of neural activity in this species, and the importance of the fly as a model for the study of many brain diseases.  Massively parallel brain imaging will open entirely new avenues: 1) The ability to track neural dynamics across the brains of large numbers of normal flies and those with genetically induced neural circuit perturbations will revolutionize our understanding of how neural circuits produce animal behavior; 2) The now prominent role of the fruit fly as a model system for the study of developmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and addiction implies we will gain significant medical insights into devastating conditions; 3) Our technology will have important applications to drug screening, allowing the cellular effects of new compounds to be assessed rapidly in vivo; 4) The ability to perform high-throughput time-lapse imaging of cellular events during the maturation of fly embryos will allow an additional revolution in developmental neurobiology. Applications of our technology will also be plentiful in other model organisms such as nematodes and zebrafish, profoundly impacting multiple areas of biomedicine. n/a",Massively Parallel Brain Imaging,7683010,DP1OD003560,"['Ablation', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amplifiers', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Axon', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Caliber', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cocaine', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Cornea', 'Crack Cocaine', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Dendrites', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fiber Optics', 'Figs - dietary', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Heating', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Invertebrates', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Larva', 'Laser Scanning Microscopy', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Light', 'Lobe', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleotides', 'Olfactory Receptor Neurons', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Photoreceptors', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Pigments', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Sapphire', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Senile Plaques', 'Shapes', 'Silicon', 'Societies', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synchrotrons', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tea', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Tube', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Virion', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Motion', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'addiction', 'age related', 'base', 'behavioral sensitization', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'cocaine exposure', 'commercialization', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'drug discovery', 'essays', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'fluorescence microscope', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'genetic strain', 'high throughput screening', 'high throughput technology', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'lens', 'light microscopy', 'light scattering', 'meetings', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'mouse genome', 'mutant', 'nanoscale', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurogenetics', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'object motion', 'optical imaging', 'optical traps', 'practical application', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'selective expression', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'structural biology', 'success', 'tool', 'two-photon']",OD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP1,2009,395000,0.0024087448645282207
"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7440338,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'addiction', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'human study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2008,216244,0.022318840964176728
"Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R03 proposal aims at developing a methodological framework for nonlinear multivariate analysis, using a non-linear pattern classification method, to identify and quantify subtle and spatially-complex brain abnormalities in unaffected family members of schizophrenia patients. Compared to conventional methods based on regions of interest (ROI) that rely only on a few pre-selected manually-labeled ROIs, this automated method will consider all brain regions simultaneously for identification of complex patterns of brain abnormality that cannot be necessarily summarized by a few pre-defined ROIs. Accordingly, a major methodological challenge to be addressed in this project is the development of statistical image analysis and data mining methods for estimating the collection of brain regions or networks that jointly form patterns to characterize schizophrenia as uniquely as possible. Patterns determined by comparison of confirmed schizophrenia patients and healthy controls will be examined on unaffected family members of patients, to test whether individuals that are genetically related to patients display, to some extent, endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Also, unaffected family members will be further compared with patients to identify the morphological profiles that seem directly associated with the phenotype of schizophrenia. The performance of the proposed nonlinear pattern analysis and classification method will be tested on an existing schizophrenia dataset in the Schizophrenia Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Although not an immediate goal of this specific proposal, the long-term objective of the proposed work is to apply this automated methodology to various studies, including (1) a large-scale genetic study of schizophrenia involving informative samples, in order to examine questions that cannot be addressed with conventional ROI-based analysis; (2) the quantification and recognition of endophenotypes of schizophrenia in unaffected individuals, which can potentially pave the way for the detection of adolescents that possess brain endophenotypes that put them at risk; (3) clinical studies investigating the added value of quantifying endophenotypes of schizophrenia for clinical diagnosis, especially in difficult cases or outside environments with well-trained psychiatrists, in which unbiased computer-based methods can potentially greatly assist in clinical evaluation and diagnosis.           n/a",Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients,7325760,R03MH076970,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Psychiatrist', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'data mining', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'member', 'research clinical testing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2008,65055,0.017804229855135877

"Transmission of Information in the Visual System How do we identify an object from the features that we detect? Understanding how the brain recognizes objects might give insight into how the brain solves problems in general. The object recognition problem has withstood a century of attempts, but we bring new tools ¿ fruits of the last grant period ¿ that allow us to sketch the outlines of a solution. Four approaches, all new and different, converge on one answer. AIM 1. Use crowding, along with other manipulations, to characterize three parallel processes in reading by normal and dyslexic readers. AIM 2. Count features by probability summation. Extending traditional probability summation from explaining just detection to also explain object identification, we acquire a new tool, allowing us to count the number of features the observer must detect in order to identify. AIM 3. Capture the observer's classification algorithm by computer modeling of the observer's responses to thousands of letters in white noise. We use statistical learning theory to build a classifier that accounts for human performance. The observer classifies each of several thousand images of a letter in noise as ""a"", ""b"", or ""c"", etc. These classifications are data that can tell us what the observer is doing. We use a powerful statistical learning algorithm to create a simple classifier that best models human performance. AIM 4. fMRI: Where in the brain are letters identified? Correlate the activation of the ""letter"" area in the left fusiform gyrus, and elsewhere, with two psychophysically-discovered signatures of letter identification: fast learning and channel frequency. Thus techniques from cognition, perception, statistical learning theory, and physiology together will reveal what is computed where, in the brain, when an observer identifies an object. n/a",Transmission of Information in the Visual System,7350139,R01EY004432,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Condition', 'Count', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Frequencies', 'Fruit', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Rate', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Schools', 'Solutions', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'detector', 'insight', 'object recognition', 'parallel processing', 'peripheral reading', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'size', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,322249,0.009253171075895539
"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effects of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding). The developmental and experimental elements of this application will lead to new avenues for treatment that would be readily generalizable to other forms of drug addiction besides nicotine, and potentially impacting on the outcomes of the substantial numbers of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of new methodology for the treatment of patients with substance use disorders would represent a significant advance in the therapeutics of these disorders.

"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7502725,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'human study', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2008,474412,-0.04151763573231833
"Biological and Information Processing Mechanisms Underlying Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This center focuses on elucidating fundamental information processing and neurobiological mechanisms causing autism. It incorporates 5 themes: 1) autism as a disorder of complex information processing abilities WITH intact or enhanced basic abilities; 2) autism as a disturbance in cerebral connectivity with under connectivity of long-distance connections and over-connectivity of compensatory local connections; 3) autism as a developmental disorder whose brain-behavioral manifestations change with each stage of brain maturation from childhood to adulthood; 4) that the pathognomonic social impairments are best understood in terms of underlying information processing mechanisms; and 5) that emotional and affective impairments are a major component of the syndrome and significant contributor to impaired function and serious behavior issues. These goals will be addressed using behavioral, cognitive, fMRI, DTI, DTT, and neuropathologic studies of: infant siblings, first-diagnosed toddlers with autism, and groups of children, adolescents, and adults with and without autism. Project I: Development of Categorization & Facial Knowledge in Low & High Functioning Autism; Project II: Disturbances of Affective Contact: Development of Brain Mechanisms for Emotion Processing; Project III: Systems Connectivity & Brain Activation: Imaging Studies of Language & Perception; Project IV: Diffusion Tensor MRI & Histopathology of Brain Microstructure & Fiber Pathways. Project I focuses on understanding the earliest manifestations of autism and the development of earlier diagnostic tools; it also focuses on information processing mechanisms underlying social and cognitive symptoms. Project II focuses on elucidating emotion processing mechanisms and the maturational disturbances from childhood through adulthood; these studies will clarify how individuals with autism experience, understand and regulate emotion, and will also examine their self-awareness of emotion. Genetic modifiers of emotionality will also be determined. Project III focuses on understanding disturbances in functional brain connectivity that underlie the impaired processing of information and in turn the cognitive and behavioral impairments in autism. The project also includes innovative machine-learning studies of how the brain identifies and categorizes words and computational modeling of cortical function. Project IV looks at structural connectivity of specific white matter pathways and the histopathology of intra-cortical white matter projections. This project will help reconcile the functional under-connectivity and early structural overgrowth in autism. The identification of fundamental information processing mechanisms underlying the behavior of autism will lead to the development of more specific and effective interventions; similarly identification of connectivity alterations can lead to targeted cognitive interventions that increase neural connectivity.

"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7502729,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'End Point', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Week', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'size', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2008,234161,-0.04525698585830819
"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7127674,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'addiction', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'human study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2007,220117,0.022318840964176728
"Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R03 proposal aims at developing a methodological framework for nonlinear multivariate analysis, using a non-linear pattern classification method, to identify and quantify subtle and spatially-complex brain abnormalities in unaffected family members of schizophrenia patients. Compared to conventional methods based on regions of interest (ROI) that rely only on a few pre-selected manually-labeled ROIs, this automated method will consider all brain regions simultaneously for identification of complex patterns of brain abnormality that cannot be necessarily summarized by a few pre-defined ROIs. Accordingly, a major methodological challenge to be addressed in this project is the development of statistical image analysis and data mining methods for estimating the collection of brain regions or networks that jointly form patterns to characterize schizophrenia as uniquely as possible. Patterns determined by comparison of confirmed schizophrenia patients and healthy controls will be examined on unaffected family members of patients, to test whether individuals that are genetically related to patients display, to some extent, endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Also, unaffected family members will be further compared with patients to identify the morphological profiles that seem directly associated with the phenotype of schizophrenia. The performance of the proposed nonlinear pattern analysis and classification method will be tested on an existing schizophrenia dataset in the Schizophrenia Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Although not an immediate goal of this specific proposal, the long-term objective of the proposed work is to apply this automated methodology to various studies, including (1) a large-scale genetic study of schizophrenia involving informative samples, in order to examine questions that cannot be addressed with conventional ROI-based analysis; (2) the quantification and recognition of endophenotypes of schizophrenia in unaffected individuals, which can potentially pave the way for the detection of adolescents that possess brain endophenotypes that put them at risk; (3) clinical studies investigating the added value of quantifying endophenotypes of schizophrenia for clinical diagnosis, especially in difficult cases or outside environments with well-trained psychiatrists, in which unbiased computer-based methods can potentially greatly assist in clinical evaluation and diagnosis.           n/a",Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients,7195436,R03MH076970,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Psychiatrist', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'data mining', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'member', 'research clinical testing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2007,78604,0.017804229855135877

It incorporates 5 themes: 1) autism as a disorder of complex information processing abilities WITH intact or enhanced basic abilities; 2) autism as a disturbance in cerebral connectivity with under connectivity of long-distance connections and over-connectivity of compensatory local connections; 3) autism as a developmental disorder whose brain-behavioral manifestations change with each stage of brain maturation from childhood to adulthood; 4) that the pathognomonic social impairments are best understood in terms of underlying information processing mechanisms; and 5) that emotional and affective impairments are a major component of the syndrome and significant contributor to impaired function and serious behavior issues. These goals will be addressed using behavioral, cognitive, fMRI, DTI, DTT, and neuropathologic studies of: infant siblings, first-diagnosed toddlers with autism, and groups of children, adolescents, and adults with and without autism. Project I: Development of Categorization & Facial Knowledge in Low & High Functioning Autism; Project II: Disturbances of Affective Contact: Development of Brain Mechanisms for Emotion Processing; Project III: Systems Connectivity & Brain Activation: Imaging Studies of Language & Perception; Project IV: Diffusion Tensor MRI & Histopathology of Brain Microstructure & Fiber Pathways. Project I focuses on understanding the earliest manifestations of autism and the development of earlier diagnostic tools; it also focuses on information processing mechanisms underlying social and cognitive symptoms. Project II focuses on elucidating emotion processing mechanisms and the maturational disturbances from childhood through adulthood; these studies will clarify how individuals with autism experience, understand and regulate emotion, and will also examine their self-awareness of emotion. Genetic modifiers of emotionality will also be determined. Project III focuses on understanding disturbances in functional brain connectivity that underlie the impaired processing of information and in turn the cognitive and behavioral impairments in autism. The project also includes innovative machine-learning studies of how the brain identifies and categorizes words and computational modeling of cortical function. Project IV looks at structural connectivity of specific white matter pathways and the histopathology of intra-cortical white matter projections. This project will help reconcile the functional under-connectivity and early structural overgrowth in autism. The identification of fundamental information processing mechanisms underlying the behavior of autism will lead to the development of more specific and effective interventions; similarly identification of connectivity alterations can lead to targeted cognitive interventions that increase neural connectivity.

"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7343348,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'End Point', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Week', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'size', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2007,225000,-0.04525698585830819
"Collaborative Brain Mapping: Tools for Sharing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sharing data between research centers is increasingly important for contemporary brain imaging studies because they involve large numbers of subjects and complex analysis protocols that require highly specialized expertise.

There are a number of difficult data management and technology challenges that have limited the success of data sharing environments. Rather than attempt to develop a comprehensive and general solution, we propose to develop a set of open, interoperable, and portable software tools that address critical issues currently limiting efforts to share and analyze brain-imaging data.

"CRCNS: Machine Learning for Analysis of fMRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",CRCNS: Machine Learning for Analysis of fMRI,7051239,R01DA020949,"['behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'clinical research', 'cocaine', 'computer data analysis', 'drug addiction', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'genotype', 'human subject', 'neuropsychology', 'reinforcer', 'substance abuse related behavior']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2005,253116,0.009859654952872485

"Adult Optical Non-Invasive Brain Oxygenation Monitor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a need for a non-invasive and continuous bedside monitor for brain oxygenation for adult human patients. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an optically based technique that could meet such demand.  However, NIRS instruments have yet to achieve their initially expected potential of becoming routine clinical monitors complementary to pulse oximetry. One major challenge is to develop an optical transducer probe and a corresponding algorithm to solve the problem of interference from extracerebral tissue (skin, scalp, and skull) in adult NIRS applications. Another major challenge is to develop an algorithm that will be able to absolutely quantify the optical signals to derive quantitative variables or indices that are of clinical significance. Our goal is to resolve these challenges to develop an NIRS monitor that will determine absolute brain hemoglobin oxygen saturation on adult patients.  The primary objectives of this SBIR proposal are: 1) Design and construct an NIRS monitor for use on adult human patients; 2) Determine the optimum adult NIRS probe configuration to minimize extracerebral interference 3) Evaluate and validate novel adult NIRS algorithms that further minimize extracerebral interference and determine absolute brain oxygen saturation.         n/a",Adult Optical Non-Invasive Brain Oxygenation Monitor,6585412,R43NS045488,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain circulation', ' infrared spectrometry', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' optics', ' oxygen transport', ' patient monitoring device', ' respiratory oxygenation', ' swine']",NINDS,"CAS MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2003,100000,0.022161247713550693

"Cross-frequency coupling: its role in brain function and dysfunction Abstract  One of the high priority research areas listed in the BRAIN 2025 Report is a better understanding of the brain network dynamics across time and space from human electrophysiological recordings. The RFA-MH-20- 120 “BRAIN Initiative: Secondary Analysis and Archiving of BRAIN Initiative Data” specifically focuses on the use of large volumes of existing data stored in open access public databases. In the proposed studies, we will perform an innovative secondary analysis of existing intracranial EEG records from patients with medicine- resistant epilepsy collected during their presurgical evaluation. These records from public repositories would allow us to study dynamic interactions between hippocampal and neocortical structures during the development of pathological activity as well as during verbal memory tasks. We will use a novel and rapidly developing approach from the realm of machine learning algorithms namely, deep learning neural networks. Physiological mechanisms of memory formation and consolidation as well as pathophysiological mechanisms of epilepsy are poorly understood. The main hypothesis of this proposal is that physiological function and dysfunction of the hippocampal-neocortical system may have a common mechanism that depends on the dynamic interaction of electrophysiological oscillations in the system. Brain oscillations have been suggested to be involved in information transfer within and between brain networks by modulating neural excitability at different spatial and temporal scales. The interaction of oscillations across different time scales is referred to as ‘cross-frequency coupling’ and it represents a high-order structure in the functional organization of brain rhythms. Aberrant patterns of cross-frequency coupling may lead to memory dysfunction as well as facilitate the propagation of pathological activity. At present, the field does not have a mechanistically justified criterion to distinguish between physiological and pathological oscillations especially regarding their high-order interactions. We will study cross- frequency coupling during the interictal-ictal transition (Aim 1) and during successful and unsuccessful verbal memory performance (Aim 2) using Deep Learning algorithms. One of the study goals is to create a neural network capable of recognizing patterns of cross-frequency coupling as biomarkers of different physiological and pathological functional states of the brain. A comprehensive characterization of cross-frequency coupling would allow us to distinguish between physiological and aberrant forms of interaction between brain networks at different time scales. The study results will deepen our knowledge about the functional organization of brain rhythms and will provide a new method to recognize functional states from electrophysiological records of brain activity. This method will be applicable for a more accurate monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of memory impairments in neurological and mental disorders as well as for the development of new tools for seizure prediction and control. Public Health Relevance Statement  A better understanding of brain dynamics from human electrophysiological recordings will help us find new ways to treat neurological and mental disorders and the BRAIN Initiative encourages the secondary analysis of large amounts of existing data. The proposed study will analyze intracranial EEG records from human participants stored in public data repositories using artificial intelligence methods. The results will deepen our knowledge of brain function and dysfunction and will pave the way for the development of new methods to diagnose and treat brain disorders.",Cross-frequency coupling: its role in brain function and dysfunction,10008042,RF1MH123192,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neocortex', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Time', 'Training', 'cognitive process', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'mind control', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'public repository', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'tool']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,839700,-0.0045186373857322324
"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9977173,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multi-task learning', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,438169,0.012574783197467965
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason for this is that most neuroimaging prediction studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple correlation relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, nonlinear relationships, or multi-site cross-validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with reference, and sparse regression can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, providing promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers and going beyond a descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain disease to individualized prediction. We will facilitate the translational biomarker identification by developing 3 novel data-driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment may affect covarying brain function and structure in mental disorder, by using different clinical measures as a reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction framework with aggregated feature selection techniques that is able to estimate clinical outcome more precisely, e.g., remission/relapse status of individual MDD patient after electroconvulsive treatment(ECT) using baseline brain imaging and demographic measures of 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep learning combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) or attention modules, to classify multiple groups of psychiatric disorders by incorporating dynamic functional measures. The proposed (Deep/Recurrent/Convolutional Neural Network, DNN/RNN/CNN) models will have enhanced interpretability that is able to trace back and discover the most predictive functional networks from input. All above proposed methods will be applied to big data containing both multimodal imaging and behavioral information (n~5000) pooled from existing studies, and our developed open-source toolboxes will be shared publicly. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, leading to earlier and more effective interventions, and laying the groundwork for a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep learning, supervised learning and functional dynamics, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, and to identify precise biomarkers that are able to predict clinical measures for new individuals and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting of a big data with imaging and behavioral info to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9999673,R01MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,395331,-0.006675254435541864
"MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants Project Summary/Abstract About 100,000 very preterm infants (VPI; ≤32 weeks gestational age) are born every year in the United States. Up to 35% develop noteworthy neurodevelopmental deficits, thereby increasing their risk for poor educational, health, and social outcomes. Unfortunately, neurodevelopmental deficits cannot currently be reliably diagnosed until 3 to 5 years of age. The imminent challenge lies in early identification of infants that are more likely to develop later deficits. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and deep learning (DL) provide means to address this challenge. Application of DL to infant brain MRI data can open up new windows into early prediction of neurodevelopmental outcomes in at-risk infants and facilitate the move towards precision medicine. Our objective is to apply DL to MRI acquired at term equivalent age for early prediction of neurodevelopment deficits (cognitive, language, and motor) at age 2 in VPI. Our group has identified three key components necessary for accurate prognostic models of later neurodevelopment. DL analysis of 1) anatomical features derived from structural MRI (sMRI) allowing detection of brain structural abnormalities and tissue pathologies; 2) brain connectivity features derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) giving insights into atypical brain connectivity patterns; and 3) integration of anatomical and connectivity features, thus enhancing abnormal neurodevelopment prediction. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will develop deepAna and deepConn models analyzing anatomical and connectivity features independently to predict adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. By decoding each model, we will identify, validate and disseminate a series of the most discriminative anatomical and connectivity features to the research community. In Aim 3, we will develop an ensemble deepAnaConn model analyzing both anatomical and connectivity features, together with clinical risk factors, for early prediction of neurodevelopmental deficits. This model will help clinicians to predict later outcomes for those at-risk prematurely born infants before initial neonatal intensive care unit discharge. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data and will open the ‘black-box’ of DL to aid interpretation of imaging and clinical findings. The techniques we develop are expected to improve the modelling fidelity in medical diagnosis/ prognosis in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. The DL models we develop will not only benefit early detection of neurodevelopmental deficits in VPI, but also likely benefit individuals with other neurodevelopmental and neurological diseases. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow clinicians to target clinical and experimental intervention therapies to the most at-risk infants during periods of optimal neuroplasticity, and thus ultimately improve medical outcomes and patient well-being. Project Narrative Babies born at younger than 32 weeks’ gestation (~100,000 per year in the US) are at high risk for neurodevelopmental problems that can have a lifelong impact on quality of life. Early, targeted intervention while the brain is still malleable is the key, but accurately predicting which children will develop which problems, has not yet been successful. Herein, we propose to use artificial intelligence/deep learning, which works by feeding a computer program with existing imaging, clinical and outcome data, and then generating a template by which clinicians can compare new imaging and clinical data to accurately predict outcomes, thus allowing early, aggressive intervention where appropriate.",MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants,10028428,R01EB029944,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Problem', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Series', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer program', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neonate', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'social', 'success']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,297504,0.010308543906919201
"Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Project Summary/Abstract: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Brain monitoring in critical care has grown dramatically over the past 20 years with the discovery that a large proportion of ICU patients suffer from subclinical seizures and seizure-like electrical events, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), detectable only by electroencephalography (EEG). This growth has created a crisis in critical care: It is clear that IIICAs damage the brain and cause permanent neurologic disability. Yet detection of IIICAs by expert visual review is often delayed suggesting we need better tools for real-time monitoring, to cope with the deluge of ICU EEG data. In other cases, IIICAs appear to be harmless epiphenomena, and many worry that increased awareness of IIICAs has created an epidemic of overly-aggressive prescribing of anticonvulsant drugs leading to preventable adverse events and costs. This crisis highlights critical unmet needs for automated EEG monitoring for IIICAs, and a better understanding of which types of IIICAs cause neural injury and warrant intervention. Causes of IIICAs range widely, from primary brain injuries like hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, to systemic medical illnesses like sepsis and uremia. Until recently, this massive clinical heterogeneity has been an insurmountable barrier to understanding the impact of IIICAs on neurologic outcome. However, recent advances in deep learning, coupled with the unprecedented availability of a massive dataset developed by our team over the last three years, makes it feasible for the first time to systematically study the relationship between IIICAs and neurologic outcomes. To meet the need for better monitoring tools and better models for understanding IIICAs, we will take a deep learning approach to leverage the as-yet untapped information in a massive ICU EEG dataset. We will pursue three Specific Aims: SA1: Comprehensively label all occurrences of IIICAs in a massive set of cEEG recordings, thus preparing the EEG data for training computers to detect IIICA patterns; SA2: Develop supervised DL algorithms to detect IIICAs as accurately as human experts, thus providing powerful tools for both research on IIICAs and for clinical brain monitoring; SA3: Estimate the effect of IIICAs on neurologic outcome: we will develop models to quantify effects of IIICAs on risk for disability after controlling for inciting illness and other clinical factors, and to predict effects of interventions to suppress IIICAs. This work will provide four crucial benefits to advance the field of precision critical care neurology, and by extension, our ability to provide optimal neurologic care for patients during critical illness. 1) Improved understanding of the clinical significance of seizure like IIICA states; 2) development of robust tools and algorithms for critical care brain telemetry; 3) a unique, massive, publicly available, thoroughly annotated dataset that will enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials. Project Narrative: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum RELEVANCE: Seizures and seizure-like brain activity, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), occur commonly in electroencephalogram recordings of brain activity in ICU patients, and simultaneously represent a preventable cause of brain injury and a common cause of over-treatment and iatrogenic harm to patients. Big Data and deep learning approaches have recently enabled advances in several fields of medicine, but have so far had little impact in ICU neuromedicine. This project will use Big Data and Deep Learning to advance the goal of protecting brain health in ICU patients, by 1) providing improved understanding of the clinical significance of IIICA states; 2) developing robust tools and algorithms for ICU brain telemetry; 3) creating a unique, massive, publicly available, annotated dataset to enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) developing a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials.",Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum,9942528,R01NS107291,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthetics', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Label', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurology', 'Nomenclature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Supervision', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uremia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'brain health', 'causal model', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intervention effect', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'nerve injury', 'neurophysiology', 'overtreatment', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'real time monitoring', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,559900,-0.011320112535543443
"Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models Project abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. A critical gap in the treatment of PD patients is that there is no clinically adopted method to predict an individual's progression rate. A predictor would enable the enrichment of disease modifying drug trials with fast progressors likely to show changes in the short duration of a clinical trial and enable a more informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops a composite biomarker of progression rate using the connectivity information provided by resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) and deep learning. Deep learning (DL) is well suited to form predictive models because it learns both an optimal hierarchy of features and how to combine them for accurate prediction. In rs-fMRI the blood-oxygen level dependent signal can be analyzed to infer connectivity throughout the brain. Traditionally, connectivity has been computed as the correlation between average regional activation time courses. However correlation based connectivity is prone to inferring spurious connections due to its inability to distinguish indirect from direct connectivity and inability to distinguish bidirectional from unidirectional connectivity. A causal connectivity approach can discern these differences and thereby provide a more faithful characterization of the true neurobiological connectivity. The existing literature suggests connectivity, particularly causal connectivity, from rs-fMRI can inform the estimation of PD progression, but the attempt to predict progression rate with causal connectivity in a DL model is unique to this project.  This research develops several distinct approaches for building a progression rate predictor and apply them to three datasets including: the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset, the NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) dataset, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's prospective imaging extension to the NINDS PBDP. In these studies, individual progression rates have been tracked over multiple years using multiple clinical measures. First, causal and correlative measures will be generated regionally and used with a DL model to create a baseline predictor of progression rate. Second, voxel- level causal measures will be generated as the increased granularity is expected to improve prediction accuracy. Third, since purely data-driven DL methods can be sensitive to dataset limitations, such as insufficient subjects and noise, these limitations will be addressed by developing a new structural connectivity regularization approach that constrains causal connectivity by the subject's own diffusion MRI. This regularization method will be general and likely applicable for building predictors for other neurological disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. This proposal will yield both DL models for predicting progression rate and a novel method to calculate constrained causal connectivity. All predictive models, composite neuroimaging biomarkers of progression rate and software will be publicly disseminated for ready incorporation by the scientific and clinical communities. Project narrative Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and this debilitating and incurable disease has no known cure. A cure for PD remains elusive due to the lack of clinically adopted predictors of progression rate, which if constructed would 1) hasten the discovery of disease modifying drugs by enriching clinical trials with fast progressors who likely will show changes over the trial, 2) allow for stratification of patients by progression rate in those trials, and 3) enable an informed discussion with patients about their prognosis. This proposal develops and validates distinct approaches to predict PD progression rate, identifies new biomarkers of progression rate, and yields a generalizable framework for constraining causal measures from fMRI with the subject's own structural connectivity that is readily repurposable for other neurological disorders with connectivity changes such as stroke and Alzheimer's.",Predicting Parkinson's Disease Progression Rate Using Causal Measures of Functional MRI with Deep Learning Predictive Models,10019347,F31NS115348,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Fiber', 'Florida', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'tractography']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2020,34768,0.0059034463593535215
"Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature Project Summary/Abstract Symptom-based diagnoses of mental illness are highly comorbid, biologically heterogeneous, and poorly predictive of treatment response. The National Institute of Mental Health has led efforts to redefine mental illness by its biological causes, establishing the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as a guide for investigating variation in basic brain systems. RDoC has been influential, named in hundreds of grants and publications, but it has yet to be systematically validated. It is unknown whether circuit-function links underlying the RDoC brain systems are reproducible across studies, and organizing principles remain largely untested. While the structure of RDoC as a modular hierarchy has evidence in resting state analyses, it has not been shown whether this applies to systems that support the diverse mental states affected in psychiatric disease. It is necessary to validate RDoC, and moreover, to establish fundamental principles of organization for systems defined jointly by human brain structure and function. The objective of this proposal is to apply large- scale computational neuroimaging meta-analyses to build a data-driven ontology that will not only serve as a benchmark in evaluating the validity of RDoC but also characterize the architecture of systems for human brain function. The long-term goal is to redefine mental illness by differences from healthy function within the brain systems of a data-driven ontology, facilitating rational targeting of neuromodulation treatments. The proposed meta-analyses will be the most comprehensive in the field with 18,155 MRI and PET studies already collected. The mental functions considered in these studies have been extracted from article texts using natural language processing, and brain circuits will be mapped from the brain coordinate data that were reported. The hypothesis is that brain systems are comprised of reproducible circuit-function links organized into a modular hierarchy, which for some systems will require updates to RDoC. This will be tested by comparing RDoC systems against those of a data-driven ontology. Aim 1: The reproducibility of circuit-function links will be evaluated by the performance of neural network classifiers predicting functions in article texts from circuits in brain scan data, and vice versa. Aim 2: The modularity of brain systems will be evaluated by a graph theoretic approach, and hierarchical structure will be assessed by representational similarity analysis. The impact of this project will be to validate the foremost psychiatry research framework and to characterize human brain systems through an innovative computational strategy. Together with targeted academic training in neurobiology, the fellowship is designed to offer preparation for a career as a physician-scientist leading advances in computational psychiatry. Training will be supported by an environment that combines world-class computing resources with esteemed and engaged mentors in psychiatry, neuroscience, and computer science. Project Narrative First-line treatments routinely fail for most of the 45 million US adults living with mental illness because psychiatric diagnoses lack a biological basis, making them unreliable predictors of treatment response. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a biologically based diagnostic system in psychiatry by characterizing the composition and structure of human brain systems through innovative computational meta-analyses of nearly 20,000 neuroimaging articles. When it is understood what makes up a brain system and how systems are organized, mental illness can be redefined by variation from healthy function, facilitating successful targeting of brain-based treatments.",Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature,9991669,F30MH120956,"['Academic Training', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Base of the Brain', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Cognitive', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Expert Opinion', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Ontology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mental function', 'mental state', 'neural network classifier', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuroregulation', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'system architecture']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,37706,0.03659959943339063
"Diagnosis of indeterminate brain lesions using MRI-based machine learning and polygenic risk models PROJECT SUMMARY In 2017 an MRI was performed at a rate of over one for every 10 US residents. The majority of these were brain MRIs. Indeterminate mass lesions are present on over 1% of brain MRIs in individuals over 45 years old. Misinterpretation of brain MRI can lead to significant iatrogenic morbidity and mortality. For example, tumefactive Central Nervous System Inflammatory Demyelinating Disease (CNSIDD) is commonly misdiagnosed as a malignancy, even following pathological review. This results in inappropriate brain biopsies, debulking and radiation. While early tumor resection is associated with favorable outcome in patients with high- grade glioma, observation, biopsy at an alternate site or nonsurgical options are often more appropriate for other indeterminate mass lesions that can encompass low-grade primary brain tumor, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastasis. Thus, to prevent iatrogenic morbidity, there is a critical need for scalable and reproducible methods to distinguish CNSIDD from other brain lesions, and to accurately diagnose brain tumors prior to biopsy. We recently published a polygenic risk model demonstrating that the 25 known glioma germline risk variants can estimate absolute and lifetime glioma risk. The clinical significance of these models is driven by germline variants that are associated with >4-fold increased risk of glioma. We have also shown that the same 25 germline variants can predict glioma molecular subtype. As a complementary approach, we have shown that imaging characteristics differ across glioma, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastases. We have successfully utilized MRI-based machine learning to predict the molecular subtype in high-grade glioma. We hypothesize that both germline genotyping and MRI-based machine learning provide an opportunity to diagnose indeterminate mass lesions as well as predict glioma molecular subtype prior to surgery and thus personalized treatment. The project has the following three aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate a MRI-based machine learning model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases of unknown primary. Aim 2: Evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the polygenic glioma risk model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases. Aim 3: Integrate the polygenic glioma subtype model and MRI-based machine learning model to predict adult diffuse glioma molecular subtype and validate the integrated model using a prospective cohort. The proposed project will further enhance the care of patients by determining if an early MRI lesion is actually a glioma. Early definitive surgery in these patients could be curative. PROJECT NARRATIVE Indeterminate mass lesions are present on over 1% of brain MRIs in individuals over 45 years old, and misinterpretation of brain MRI can lead to significant iatrogenic morbidity and mortality. To prevent iatrogenic morbidity, there is a critical need for scalable and reproducible methods to distinguish indeterminate brain lesions from each other, and to accurately diagnose brain tumors prior to biopsy. We hypothesize that both germline genotyping and MRI-based machine learning provide an opportunity to diagnose indeterminate mass lesions as well as predict glioma molecular subtype prior to surgery and thus personalized treatment.",Diagnosis of indeterminate brain lesions using MRI-based machine learning and polygenic risk models,10050079,R01NS113803,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain Pathology', 'Central Nervous System Lymphoma', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Genotype', 'Glioma', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measures', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mutate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neuraxis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Training', 'Tumor Debulking', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'improved', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'risk variant', 'tool', 'tumor']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,623080,0.0353003159975733
"Distributional reinforcement learning in the brain. Project Summary The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has recently made remarkable advances that resulted in new and improved algorithms and network architectures that proved efficient empirically in silico. These advances raise new questions in neurobiology: are these new algorithms used in the brain? The present study focuses on a new algorithm developed in the field of reinforcement learning (RL), called distributional RL, which outperforms other state-of-the-art RL algorithms and is regarded as a major advancement in RL. In environments in which rewards are probabilistic with respect to its occurrence and size, traditional RL algorithms have focused on learning to predict a single quantity, the average over all potential rewards. Distributional RL, by contrast, learns to predict the entire distribution over rewards (or values) by employing multiple value predictors that together encode all possible levels of future reward concurrently. Remarkably, theoretical work has shown that a class of distributional RL, called ‘quantile distributional RL’, can arise out of a simple modification of traditional RL that introduces structured variability in dopamine reward prediction error (RPE) signals. This project set out to test the hypothesis that the brain utilizes distributional RL to predict future rewards. Aim 1 will explore the characteristics of distributional RL theoretically and make predictions that allow for testing distributional RL in the brain. Theoretical investigations and simulations will be used to determine how value representations in distributional RL differ from pre-existing population coding schemes for representing probability distributions (probabilistic population codes, distributed distributional codes, etc.). Aim 2 will examine the activity of neurons that are thought to signal RPEs and reward expectation and test various predictions of distributional RL. Specifically, the activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and neurons in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex will be compared to key predictions of distributional RL. Aim 3 will use optogenetic manipulation to causally demonstrate the relationship between RPE signals and distributional codes. Narrative Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, anhedonia, apathy, schizophrenia, addiction, eating disorders and Parkinson’s disease. In particular, aberrant dopamine responses to salient events have been implicated in addiction, schizophrenia and other mental disorders. Understanding dopamine signaling in the healthy brain is essential to understanding states of aberrant dopamine signaling.",Distributional reinforcement learning in the brain.,9978224,R01NS116753,"['Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dopamine', 'Eating Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rewards', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'addiction', 'artificial neural network', 'classical conditioning', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in silico', 'learning algorithm', 'network architecture', 'neuromechanism', 'optimism', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1162348,-0.01223535607834346
"Crossing space and time: uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of multimodal and multiscale brain activity The brain is a complex dynamical system, with a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales ranging from microns and milliseconds to centimeters and years. Activity at any given scale contributes to activity at the scales above it and can influence activity at smaller scales. Thus a true understanding of the brain requires the ability to understand how each level contributes to the system as a whole. Most brain research focuses on a single scale (single unit firing, activity in a circuit), which cannot account for the constraints imposed by activities at other scales. The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework for the integration of multiscalar, multimodal measurements of brain activity. One of the challenges in understanding how activity translates across scales is that features that are relevant at one scale (e.g., firing rate) do not have clear analogues at other scales. We address this issue by defining trajectories in “state space” at each scale, where the state space is defined by parameters and time scales appropriate to each type of data. The trajectory of brain activity through state space can uncover features like attractor dynamics and limit cycles that characterize the evolution of activity. Using machine learning along with new and existing multimodal measurements of brain activity (MRI, optical, and electrophysiological), we propose to establish methods that relate trajectories across scales while handling the mismatch in temporal sampling rates inherent in multi-scale data. Specific aims are 1. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at fast scales influence activity at slower scales. Different modalities have different inherent temporal resolutions in addition to different types of contrast. Current methods generally downsample the faster modality in some way, losing much information in the process. We will leverage variants on long short-term memory (LSTM) network architectures to learn the relationship between state space trajectories acquired simultaneously with population recording and optical imaging, and with optical imaging and fMRI. 2. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at slow scales influence activity at faster scales. Leveraging the same LSTM-based approach, we will learn how slower, larger scale activity affects activity at smaller scales, using whisker stimulation as a test case. We anticipate inclusion of the large scale activity (measured with fMRI or optical imaging) will improve prediction of the response at smaller scales (measured with optical imaging or population recording). Our work will allow us to begin to answer a wide range of questions about how the brain functions (e.g., what type of localized stimulation that will drive the brain to a desired global state? How does modulation of the global brain state affect local information processing?) and provide guidance for future experiments by identifying key features that influence activity across scales. By approaching the whole brain as a complex dynamical system, we will break free from the limitations of previous studies that focus on individual cells or circuits. We also expect our work to stimulate new theories that incorporate multiple scales of activity. The brain is a complex, dynamical system that exhibits structured activity at many different space and time scales. Most existing studies focus on a single scale (for example, spiking of individual neurons or activity in a particular circuit). However, interactions occur across scales and may account for much of the variability observed in the brain. This proposal will develop a framework for integrating data from different scales using machine learning tools. The results will improve our understanding of how the brain functions and serve as a foundation for modeling neuromodulatory treatments for brain disorders.",Crossing space and time: uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of multimodal and multiscale brain activity,10007011,R01EB029857,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'brain research', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'long short term memory', 'long short term memory network', 'millisecond', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiscale data', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'optical imaging', 'predicting response', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1124452,0.0011839853980859412
"Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis Abstract: Metastasis from the primary tumor site to the brain is the most lethal complication of cancer progression and is experienced by approximately 20% of breast cancer patients worldwide. There is at present no translational approach to detect if a primary tumor has brain metastatic potential, no markers that predict successful future metastasis, and thus no therapies to target any of the processes involved. These gaps are difficult to bridge due to a lack of technology that can classify a cancer cell’s brain metastatic potential. Current in vivo murine models are slow to manifest metastasis and do not have the capability of capturing single cell morphology and dynamics; therefore, we propose a diagnostic platform to measure the phenotypic differences between cancer cells and to assign them a brain metastatic potential. The output is a quantitative diagnostic read out that defines the probability of a patient's cell metastasizing to the brain. Preliminary data suggests we may use this platform to brain metastatic behavior in 24-72 hrs. We have demonstrated that we can classify non-brain seeking and brain seeking cell lines based on phenotypic metrics such as migration, extravasation, shape and volume with a positive predictive value of 0.9. This study will validate the performance of this platform on patient cells. Further we aim to understand what components of the brain stromal space promote brain metastasis to further improve the performance of this technology and identify candidates that could be targeted by therapeutics to prevent metastasis in patients that have been identified as at risk. In summary, we propose a unique approach to measure the individual metastatic potential of tumor cells spatially and temporally. This work will result in both improved clinical stratification and, downstream from it, in a more robust set of targetable pathways for prevention of brain metastasis from breast and other primary sites. Public health narrative: This grant would help develop a new clinical approach to predicting the progression of primary cancer into brain metastasis. This is the most lethal complication of breast cancer. Preventing this would save lives and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year.",Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis,9878354,R21CA245597,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast cancer metastasis', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical stratification', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Extravasation', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer cell', 'cancer complication', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experience', 'histological slides', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'operation', 'organ on a chip', 'pathology imaging', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tomography', 'translational approach', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2020,218790,-0.04022652854312267
"Open-source software for multi-scale mapping of the human brain Project Summary (maximum 30 lines) The BRAIN initiative seeks to develop and apply technologies in order to understand of how brain cells interact in both time and space to give rise to brain function. A key deliverable in BRAIN is a systematic census of neuronal and glial cell types, which is a prerequisite to understand how these cells interact and change in healthy aging and in disease. Moreover, such a census will provide a common reference cell taxonomy, which is crucial to harmonize studies at different sites and achieve the goals of BRAIN.  A necessary companion of the census is a reference coordinate system, which enables us to understand the spatio-anatomical context in which cells interact, as well as their connectivity. Building such a coordinate system requires advanced spatial alignment (registration) tools, since virtually every lab technique used in microscopic brain cell phenotyping – particularly in human brain – requires blocking and/or sectioning of samples, hence distorting the structure of tissue. Due to the difficulty of providing support for datasets and acquisition setups different to the original, most publicly available techniques to recover the lost tissue structure (“3D reconstruction”) rely on very simple techniques, such as vanilla pairwise registration of neighboring sections. Moreover, conventional reconstruction methods are notoriously slow, and no available method is designed to 3D reconstruct whole human brains.  In this interdisciplinary project, which lies at the nexus of computer science, MRI physics, histology, optical imaging, anatomy and statistics, we propose to extend, robustify, test, distribute and support our recently developed, state-or-the-art techniques that will enable the constructions of a coordinate system capable of representing multi-scale maps of human brain anatomy and function. This includes algorithms and software for: image analysis of ex vivo MRI; construction of laminar models of the human cerebral cortex; 3D reconstruction of microscopic images and alignment to the laminar models; surface based analysis of microscopy data on the laminar structure; and alignment of ex vivo and in vivo images to accurately transfer information from microscopy to MRI studies of the living brain, in health and in disease.  The tools we propose to build and disseminate will combine modern deep learning techniques with principled Bayesian inference, and have the potential to deliver accurate registration at the macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic level, with high throughput delivered using cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. Effective dissemination of these tools, along with companion test data, will be achieved through our widespread package FreeSurfer. The distributed tools will not only enable the construction of a cell census with rich spatial information at human brain scale (including a novel laminar model), but will also have a tremendous impact in other areas of neuroimaging, including overarching goals of BRAIN such as: linking cellular-level activity to functional MRI, atlas building, or connecting axonal anatomy to diffusion MRI. Project narrative (maximum 3 sentences) In this project, we seek resources to develop, integrate, distribute and support a set of tools for the automated spatial mapping of in vivo (MRI, PET, etc…) and ex vivo (microscopy) imaging modalities, which can be used to enhance the BRAIN cell census with a coordinate system for representing maps of human brain function and anatomy at multiple scales – including laminar models of the cerebral cortex that have been long desired by the neuroimaging community. The tools will include algorithms for segmentation of ex vivo MRI; laminar modeling; registration of microscopic images to MRI; and analysis of histological data on spherical coordinate systems of the cortex. These tools will not only enable the scientific community to include spatial information into the cell census, but will also have a dramatic impact on other neuroimaging projects related to the BRAIN initiative in terms of their ability to share and compare data in a unified coordinate system and use the results of BRAIN research to make inferences in studies of living human beings.",Open-source software for multi-scale mapping of the human brain,10008355,RF1MH123195,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Axon', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Stem', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebrum', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fiber', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genus Vanilla', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Iron', 'Licensing', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'computer science', 'contrast imaging', 'data sharing', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'healthy aging', 'heterogenous data', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microscopic imaging', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'sample fixation', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,RF1,2020,558806,0.041874508067546536
"Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders Project Summary/Abstract Substance use costs society $740 billion dollars each year, placing an enormous burden on our nation’s health care and criminal justice systems. Approximately 85% of incarcerated offenders in the United States have a history of substance use and/or are imprisoned for crimes involving or motivated by alcohol and/or drug use. Incarcerated individuals tend to show poorer outcomes following substance use treatment, and forced abstinence via imprisonment is associated with risk for future substance use, which likely contributes to substance-related antisocial behavior following imprisonment. Over the past few decades, women have been sentenced to prison for drug-related reasons at alarming rates, with a growth rate exceeding that for men. Further, women offenders tend to be impacted more heavily by substance use with co-morbid psychopathology, placing greater demands on the system in terms of substance use and mental health treatments. Using the world’s largest forensic neuroimaging database on women offenders (SWANC-F), this proposal investigates substance use and related antisocial behavior following release from prison in a large sample of women offenders, with a focus on neurobiological mechanisms, to demonstrate the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women. Substance-related antisocial behavior, defined as committing crime(s) related to substance use after release from prison, will be obtained from re-arrest data in institutional files and comprehensive background checks on all women enrolled in the study. A random sample (n = 100) will then be followed-up with via phone to gather data on substance use and obtain supplemental information to corroborate re-arrest data from files and background checks. Employing regression analyses and machine learning/pattern classifier approaches, models will be compared testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic variables, along with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) brain measures, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes of interest in women. Specifically, this proposal seeks to test the extent to which psychiatric and socioeconomic factors confer risk for substance-related antisocial behavior following release from prison in women (Aim 1), and integrates and compares the utility of rsFC brain measures in improving these prediction models (Aim 2). Then, similar methods will be applied to test the prediction of substance use following release from prison (Aim 3). It is expected that psychiatric risk factors and socioeconomic protective factors, as well as rsFC brain measures, will be useful in predicting substance use and related antisocial behavior following incarceration, along with time elapsed between release from prison and initiation of substance use and related behavior. Testing factors that aid in predicting these behaviors in women has the potential to be far-reaching by informing the development of targeted treatments, including those that help to account for sex differences and co-morbid conditions related to substance use. Project Narrative Women represent one of the fastest growing segments of substance users in the United States, with a growth rate of substance-related offending exceeding that of men; however, women continue to be one of the most underserved populations in substance use research. This proposal will compare statistical models testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic factors, along with resting-state functional connectivity in and between cognitive control, decision-making, and reward-processing neural circuitry, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes in women. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women in an effort to help inform future treatment efforts.","Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders",10001326,F31DA047048,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fibrinogen', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prisons', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offender', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'psychopathic personality', 'reward processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'support vector machine']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2020,36051,0.02040089017558256
"Learning high-dimensional functional connectomes of heterogeneous populations PROJECT SUMMARY Network analysis of brain connectivity, or Connectomics, has emerged as an important interdisciplinary field, making strides in advancing both fundamental scientific knowledge on the structure of the brain, as well as providing insights into the pathology of neurological disorders. Advances in neuroimaging technologies have enabled acquisition of high-resolution datasets on brain activities in normal and diseased populations, while advanced machine learning methods hold promise to obtain data-driven insights into the functional architecture of the brain. Functional connectivity analysis is typically carried out in two steps. First, one estimates a network among different brain regions by studying strengths of associations among the time course of neurophysiological signals for different subjects (patients or healthy controls). Next, one compares the networks between different groups of subjects and seeks network features prevalent in specific groups of interest using statistical methods. Two emerging challenges in this field are the presence of heterogeneity amongst subjects in large study cohorts, and developing predictive models to construct robust and interpretable results. The central goal of this proposal is to address these challenges by developing machine learning methods equipped with uncertainty quantification measures, suitable for high-dimensional network data for heterogeneous populations. Upon completion, these methods are expected to provide automated, robust and more accurate discovery of connectivity patterns that is prevalent in heterogeneous populations of patients. We aim to accomplish this goal by pursuing two specific aims: (1) develop estimation and inference methods for frequency domain measures of high-dimensional functional connectivity networks, (2) develop a framework of mixed effects model of high-dimensional functional connectivity networks that accounts for heterogeneity among subjects and enables discoveries more likely to generalize in large cohorts. For each aim, novel machine learning methods for integrative analysis of structural and functional connectivity will be developed using a mathematical model of network diffusion. We will also calibrate and validate our proposed methods on data from Human Connectome Project, and on multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The proposed approach is innovative since it integrates machinery across diverse disciplines, including statistics, machine learning and network analysis to address important challenges learning large functional connectivity graphs. The proposed research is significant in that it is expected to have both scientific and translational impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding brain connectivity patterns using rigorous machine learning methods can help seek common patterns in large databases in an automated fashion, and can potentially lead to development of neuroimaging based diagnostic tools and sensitive prognostic measures. The proposed research will thus use fundamental scientific knowledge about brain to assist translational research in neurological disease.",Learning high-dimensional functional connectomes of heterogeneous populations,10110789,R21NS120227,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cations', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Interest Group', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain size', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning network', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical model', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neurological pathology', 'neuropathology', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,428417,0.042431229657801474
"Advancing Secondary Data Analysis: the ENIGMA Brain Injury Data Harmonization Initiative Project Summary/Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue globally, and while neuroimaging has been useful in understanding disruption in brain structure and function after injury, there are a number of factors that attenuate its prognostic ability. For example, there is tremendous heterogeneity in outcome after injury which is only partially explained by injury severity. Cost frequently limits sample size in neuroimaging studies, yet given the myriad factors that have been shown to influence patient outcome (age, injury severity, socioeconomic status), small samples and mass univariate testing often result in many studies being grossly under-powered. One solution is to combine data and create novel data sharing platforms, and the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium has supported this kind of collaboration for over a decade across a range of clinical disorders. The goal of this proposal is to develop tools and data processing procedures for use in the ENIGMA Brain Injury working group. In the R61 phase, we aim to develop and test a workflow for harmonized processing of behavioral data (Aim 1) as well as structural and functional (resting-state) MRI data (Aim 2). For Aim 1 of the R61, the goal is to offer a decision tree of procedures that is data-dependent, allowing investigators to establish common cognitive endpoints across cohorts that collect a range of neuropsychological and clinical measures. This proposal will create sharable procedures, flexible tools, and generalizable guidelines for best practices for extracting common cognitive endpoints from distinct behavioral test batteries (R61 Aim 1). In Aim 2 of the R61, we develop an image processing pipeline called Harmonization and Aggregation for Functional and structural imaging data PIPEline; HAF-PIPE) that allows for aggregation of non-equivalent imaging data. A primary goal is to decentralize ComBat, an open-source data harmonization tool, so that it can be used in a virtual sharing environment. Following satisfaction of the R61 Go/No-Go criteria, which is the curation of the dataset including 13 cohorts, extraction of common cognitive endpoints, and creation of HAF- PIPE, we will move to the R33 phase. In the R33 phase, we will leverage the large, harmonized dataset and apply a machine learning technique (CorEx - Correlation Explanation) to identify patient clusters within each patient population studied. HAF-PIPE and the procedures and guidelines from the R61 phase will then be extended to additional patient populations and made available to other ENIGMA working groups. The harmonized data, along with the tools and procedures for creating them, will be accessible to researchers following proposal submission and approval as a curated dataset. With success, this proposal holds the promise of significantly advancing data curation, harmonization, and sharing in the clinical neurosciences. We anticipate that our proposal will significantly advance our understanding of factors that impact outcome after injury and will yield a tool that will be useful across the neuroimaging community. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause widespread alteration in brain structure and function, but sample size in imaging studies is often limited, and differences in data acquisition and variables can create obstacles to data sharing. We propose to develop an open-source workflow for utilizing behavioral and MRI data that addresses these concerns and allows for harmonization across sites, supporting “big data” analyses that can identify clinically-meaningful patient subgroups in TBI, a goal that is not feasible with small datasets. Achieving the proposed Aims will make a curated and harmonized dataset available to the TBI community as well as procedures and data processing pipelines adaptable to other disorders in the clinical neurosciences.",Advancing Secondary Data Analysis: the ENIGMA Brain Injury Data Harmonization Initiative,10129715,R61NS120249,"['Address', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Attenuated', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Study', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral construct', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'combat', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data curation', 'data harmonization', 'data ingestion', 'data pipeline', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'flexibility', 'heterogenous data', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'insight', 'multimodal data', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'portability', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sharing platform', 'stroke recovery', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual environment', 'working group']",NINDS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R61,2020,1015434,0.029449329219425887
"A decentralized macro and micro gene-by-environment interaction analysis of substance use behavior and its brain biomarkers   Abstract Wide-spread data sharing has started to permeate the brain imaging community from funders to researchers. However, in recent years there have also been some concerns raised regarding ethical issues related to privacy and data ownership among others. In the parent award we are leveraging and extending a privacy preserving decentralized data sharing platform called COINSTAC to perform a study of gene-by-environmental effects by pooling together data from across the world, some of which is unable to be openly shared. In this supplement we will study various bioethical issues related to different data sharing strategies. This will include calculating risk scores from existing data to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning to potentially reidentify from similar or different data types, a detailed survey of various policy makers and stakeholders including researchers, federal employees, IRB members, and more, and finally the development of a forward looking white paper addressing both privacy, policy, and regulatory aspects which attempts to frame the various aspects that arise in the contact of the spectrum of data sharing approaches including fully open, ‘trust’ based via data usage agreements, privacy preserving via tools like COINSTAC, and more. The outcomes of this supplement will provide a useful guide for the field going forward and also provide initial data necessary to develop a larger scale project on these topics going forward. Narrative The era of big data, open science, and deep learning is upon us, and data sharing can be done in various ways ranging from fully open to privacy preserving to fully closed. However bioethical issues related to risk, privacy, and data sharing strategies have not been well studied in the context of combined brain imaging, genomics, and macro-environmental data and can be especially sensitive in the context of information such as substance use. In this supplement we will quantify risk levels, survey a broad community of stakeholders, and develop recommendations for the field going forward.",A decentralized macro and micro gene-by-environment interaction analysis of substance use behavior and its brain biomarkers  ,10131528,R01DA049238,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Big Data', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'China', 'Climate', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Protection', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Economic Burden', 'Employee', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethnic group', 'Europe', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Household', 'Image', 'Income', 'India', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Privacy', 'Quality Control', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Smoking', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Update', 'Urbanization', 'Visualization', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'drinking', 'early life stress', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'epidemiologic data', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic profiling', 'human subject', 'imaging genetics', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'open data', 'open source', 'peer', 'privacy preservation', 'psychiatric symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'rural area', 'sex', 'sharing platform', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'urban area', 'virtual']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,149834,0.011721937082816086
"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders. Detailed analysis of structural relationships of both blood and lymphatic circulation in the brain system will have a direct impact on our general understanding of vascular function in brain/meningeal communication, and the cause and resolution of numerous diseases resulting from intracranial vascular disorders including impact of sex hormone (estrogen) deprivation, sleep deprivation, migraines, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dural arterio-venous fistulae, intradural hygroma and hematoma, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and intradural aneurysms that can lead to the development of neurological and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's. Quantitative description of blood and lymphatic vessel network structures using image analytics and machine learning algorithms distributed as software tools will have broad applications to quantification of other thin complex curvilinear anatomical structures (i.e. nerves, neuronal circuits, neurons, and neuroglia). The new software for blood and vessel network measurement will enable translation of fundamental pathophysiological knowledge gained from this proposal towards the development and assessment of the effectiveness of treatments and therapeutic interventions to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability associated with a range of neurological disorders.",Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system,9914136,R01NS110915,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animals', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Insomnia', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Lymphangioma', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Estrogens', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Health', 'Hematoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lymphatic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meningeal', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subdural Hematoma', 'Subdural Hygroma', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vascular resistance', 'Venous', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'body system', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'geometric structure', 'in vivo', 'lymphatic circulation', 'lymphatic vasculature', 'lymphatic vessel', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microleakage', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal circuitry', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'response', 'sex', 'sleep pattern', 'solute', 'stem', 'submicron', 'tool', 'wasting']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2020,540520,-0.040090931070174064
"Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Abstract: The increasing availability of infant brain MR images, such as those that will be collected through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP, on which Dr. Shen is a Co-PI, focusing on data acquisition), affords unprecedented opportunities for precise charting of dynamic early brain developmental trajectories in understanding normative and aberrant growth. However, to fully benefit from these datasets, a major barrier that needs to be overcome is the critical lacking of computational tools for accurate processing and analysis of infant MRI data, which typically exhibit poor tissue contrast, large within tissue intensity variation, and regionally-heterogeneous and dynamic changes. To fill this critical gap, in 2012 we pioneered in creating an infant-centric MRI processing software package, called infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Tool (iBEAT), and a set of infant-specific atlases, called UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases, and further made them freely and publicly available via NITRC. Over the last 4 years, iBEAT and UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases have been downloaded 2900+ and 5600+ times, respectively, and contributed to 160+ independent research papers. As indicated by 30+ support letters, iBEAT is now driving the research for MRI studies of early brain development in many labs throughout the world. Results produced by iBEAT are also highlighted in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT, by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. To achieve this goal, we propose four aims. In Aim 1, we will create an innovative learning-based multi-source information integration framework for joint skull stripping and tissue segmentation for accurate structural measurements. Our method employs random forest to adaptively learn the optimal image appearance features from multimodality images and also informative context features from tissue probability maps. In Aim 2, we will construct longitudinal infant brain atlases at multiple time points (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age) for both T1-/T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR images. We propose a longitudinally-consistent sparse representation technique to construct representative atlases with significantly improved structural details by explicitly dealing with possible misalignments between images even after registration. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel learning-based approach for cortical topology correction and integrate it, along with our infant-centric analysis tools and atlases for cortical surfaces, into iBEAT for precise mapping of dynamic and complex cortical changes in infants. Unlike existing tools that perform poorly for infant brains, we will incorporate infant-dedicated tools for topology correction, surface reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and measurements. We will further integrate longitudinal infant cortical surface atlases equipped with parcellations based on growth trajectories. In Aim 4, we will significantly enhance iBEAT in terms of its software functionalities as well as user support via systematic outreach and training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC. Project Narrative This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. In particular, we propose four aims: 1) Learning-Based Brain Segmentation; 2) Infant Brain Atlases in the First Year of Life; 3) Cortical Surface-Based Analysis; and 4) Enhancing User Experience and Training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC.",Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools,9919645,R01MH117943,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education and Outreach', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'cranium', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'diffusion weighted', 'experience', 'file format', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,465332,0.03272830702087541
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,10019696,R33MH118170,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Archives', 'Astrocytes', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Production', 'RNA', 'RNA Probes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'endophenotype', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual response', 'injured', 'injury and repair', 'injury recovery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'machine learning algorithm', 'manufacturability', 'medical attention', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'microchip', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'nanomagnetic', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nucleic acid detection', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ratiometric', 'research clinical testing', 'response to injury', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular injury']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R33,2020,411386,0.02980949351469416
"Development and clinical validation of multimodal risk algorithms for predicting future internalizing psychopathology I am currently Assistant Professor and a licensed clinical psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Vermont. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator using novel strategies in developmental neuroimaging to study mood and anxiety symptomatology from birth to maturity. Although I have been trained in the analysis of longitudinal structural MRI, I require further training in the processing and analysis of state-of-the-art multiband neuroimaging data that allows for more sensitive measures of brain connectivity. I am also lacking expertise with regard to more sophisticated analytic methods for more fully leveraging large-sample multimodal datasets. Such approaches will enable me to move beyond conventional univariate statistical analyses and prepare me for future Big Data initiatives. During the proposed K08 period, my overarching goal is to develop expertise in the application of machine-learning approaches to multimodal data in order to characterize the most salient psychosocial and brain-based predictors of youth internalizing psychopathology. To achieve these goals, I am pursuing career development and training activities in the following areas: 1) assessment and characterization of psychosocial risk factors; 2) theory and implementation of Big Data methods, including machine learning algorithms and cross-validation strategies; 3) analysis of multiband multimodal brain imaging data using Human Connectome Project pipelines with the aim of more comprehensively assessing aspects of cortico-limbic connectivity; 4) independently running my own neuroimaging research study; and 5) developing and submitting a competitive R01 application. In order to obtain this expertise, I am proposing training activities at several institutions, including the University of Vermont, Harvard Medical School, McGill University, and Oregon Health and Science University. The research project in this K08 proposal aims to produce risk algorithms for a transdiagnostic dimension of psychopathology, using novel machine learning approaches to leverage two of the largest longitudinal neuroimaging samples in the world (IMAGEN and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study). These risk algorithms will subsequently undergo refinement using a new sample of clinic-referred youths that I will recruit from an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Vermont. As part of the project, I will also test the degree to which these algorithms predict treatment response. These data will be used as pilot data for my planned R01 application. Given the methods that I am proposing, this project will be able to detect complex non-linear interactions involving risk factors from a multitude of domains. As a result, this work will inform, and help to delineate, various etiological pathways that ultimately result in internalizing problems. Most importantly, this project could inform early identification and targeted intervention strategies during a critical period for the development of internalizing symptomatology. !

"C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative ABSTRACT The BRAIN Initiative is designed to leverage sophisticated neuromodulation, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging techniques in human and non-human animal models in order to develop a multilevel understanding of human brain function. However, the necessary tools for organizing, processing and analyzing neuroimaging data generated through these efforts are not widely available as coherent and easy-to- use software packages. Gaps are particularly apparent for nonhuman data (i.e., monkey, rodent), as most of the existing processing and analytic software packages are specifically designed for human imaging. Methods have been proposed for addressing the challenges inherent to the processing of nonhuman data (e.g., brain extraction, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, brain parcellation, temporal denoising); to date, these have not been readily integrated into an easy-to-use, robust, and reproducible analysis package. Similarly, many of the sophisticated machine learning and modeling methods developed for neuroimaging analyses are inaccessible to most researchers because they have not been integrated into easy-to-use pipeline software. As a result, translational and comparative neuroimaging researchers patch together neuroinformatics pipelines that use various combinations of disparate software packages and in-house code. We propose to extend the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) open-source software to provide robust and reproducible pipelines for functional and structural MRI data. We will integrate the various disparate image processing and analysis methods used to handle the challenges of nonhuman imaging data, into a single, open source, configurable, easy-to-use end-to-end analysis pipeline package that is accessible locally or via the cloud. The end product will not only improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of nonhuman translational and comparative imaging, but also enable new avenues of scientific inquiry through our inclusion of methods that are yet to be applied to nonhuman imaging data (e.g., gradient- based cortical parcellation methods, hyperalignment). Specific aims of the proposed work include to: 1) Integrate neuroimaging processing and analysis methods optimized for BRAIN Initiative data, 2) Implement strategies for carrying out comparative studies of human and non-human populations, and 3) Extend C-PAC to include cutting-edge analytical strategies for identifying mechanisms of brain function. All development will occur “in the open” using GitHub and other collaborative tools to maximally involve participation in the C-PAC project. Annual hackathons will be held to collaborate with investigators from BRAIN Initiative awards and other neuroinformatics development projects to integrate their tools with C-PAC. Hands-on training will be held to train investigators on optimal use of the newly developed tools. NARRATIVE New neuroimaging analysis software is needed to process and analyze the various human and non-human neuroimaging data collected through the BRAIN Initiative. We will address this need by extending the already mature C-PAC human brain imaging data analysis pipeline to include support for animal data, with a particular focus on providing methods for conducting comparative studies between species. The proposed work will also include a toolbox for helping to align electrophysiological data that is commonly collected in non-human studies, with the brain imaging data.","C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative",9954159,R24MH114806,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Capital', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Software Design', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validity of Results', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'animal data', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cloud based', 'comparative', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'denoising', 'design', 'flexibility', 'graphical user interface', 'hackathon', 'human imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'investigator training', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuroregulation', 'open source', 'software as a service', 'structured data', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,"CHILD MIND INSTITUTE, INC.",R24,2020,545239,0.024541235947217372
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9882986,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2020,16736,0.004301672343449328
"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three-dimensional (3D) whole-brain imaging of non-transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole-brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole-brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole-brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo-bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide-spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state-of-the-art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,10019728,R44MH116827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2020,1313060,0.03588234783651527
"Automatic Control of Propanidid and Propofol Anesthesia-Induced Unconsciousness Project Summary/Abstract Current clinical practice of anesthesiology involves administering anesthetics using standard dosing guidelines, monitoring physiological responses during administration, and adjusting the dose depending on the patient responses. Importantly, direct monitoring of the brain is not part of standard anesthesiology practice, despite the desired effect taking place in the brain. In cases where the brain is directly monitored, proprietary, drug-independent, non-personalized depth of unconsciousness indices are commonly used to infer conscious state from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This may result in overdosing, as there are significant inter-individual differences in neurological response to identical doses of anesthetics and signatures of anesthesia vary significantly with age or with choice of anesthetic. Consequently, older patients are often given more anesthetic than necessary and are at high risk for developing post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and delirium, which may last up to several months. The prevalence of surgical procedures on older patients will rise as the population ages, necessitating new approaches for ensuring safe, personalized delivery of anesthetics that ensure unconsciousness, but also safety and return to normal cognitive function following surgery. This project seeks to develop closed-loop control of general anesthesia in humans as a means of personalizing anesthesia care. Aim 1 of this project seeks to use machine learning to develop a drug- specific marker of depth of unconsciousness that reflects the varying signatures of unconsciousness with age and may be understood clinically in terms of brain function. Aim 2 of this project is to develop models and nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) algorithms for regulating depth of unconsciousness during general anesthesia. MPC is a control scheme that may be easily modified to incorporate clinical safety features and has been used extensively in medical control systems. To tightly regulate depth of unconsciousness, fast actuation by the anesthetic is critical. Aim 3 of this project seeks to characterize the effect of propanidid, a fast-acting anesthetic currently used in clinical practice in Mexico. The culmination of Aim 2 will result in designing clinical trials for the first closed- loop anesthetic control and the culmination of Aim 3 will result in designing a clinical pharmacokinetic study of propanidid. The results of this project have the potential to transform clinical practice of anesthesia and allow individualized anesthesia care. By direct EEG monitoring and control of brain state rather than secondary markers, the personalized treatment developed by this project should help reduce overdosing of senior surgical patients and reduce incidence of POCD and delirium. Project Narrative The proposed work will develop algorithms for monitoring and regulating depth of unconsciousness during general anesthesia, with an emphasis on understanding how neural signatures of unconsciousness change as the brain ages. This project will also characterize the effects of propanidid, a fast-acting anesthetic ideal for use in a control system. The results of this research will improve our ability to tightly regulate depth of unconsciousness through automation and reduce the incidence of anesthetic overdosing and postoperative delirium through personalized medicine.",Automatic Control of Propanidid and Propofol Anesthesia-Induced Unconsciousness,10083163,F32AG064886,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Dependence', 'Depressed mood', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'General Anesthesia', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Infusion procedures', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Nociception', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Propofol', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'Update', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive recovery', 'design', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mind control', 'model design', 'novel strategies', 'older patient', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'post-operative cognitive dysfunction', 'postoperative delirium', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'unsupervised learning']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,F32,2020,68010,-0.008010156229943518
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals. We will provide advanced brain image processing, mathematical tools, and a portal for researchers to access and add to findings.",High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain,9923542,R01AG059874,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Sex Differences', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'aging brain', 'aging population', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'biobank', 'brain health', 'cognitive testing', 'data harmonization', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data tools', 'demented', 'dementia risk', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome', 'flexibility', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'global health', 'healthy aging', 'image processing', 'imaging genetics', 'insight', 'male', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,619917,0.019150293870967016
"Innovative biostatistical approaches to network level analyses of connectome-behavior relationships PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Determining the mechanisms by which the human brain generates cognition, perception, and emotion hinges upon quantifying the relationships between coordinated brain activity and behavior. NIH-funded brain mapping initiatives such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Adolescent Cognitive and Behavioral Development (ABCD) study, have accelerated the production of large brain connectivity (i.e. connectome) and behavioral datasets. Contemporary connectome research views the brain as a large-scale, complex network composed of nonadjacent, yet connected brain regions. We propose to leverage the inherent network architecture of the connectome in order to probe fundamental biological mechanisms underlying the development of executive function and internalizing symptoms. In pursuit of this research question, this application proposes to formalize and validate in house analysis pipelines into a Network Level Analysis (NLA) toolbox as a comprehensive, versatile tool for use in connectome-wide association studies. The proposed NLA toolbox fulfills BRAIN Initiative goal #5 to “Produce conceptual foundations for understanding the biological basis of mental processes through development of new theoretical and data analysis tools”. While the research focus of this career transition award is on the application of NLA to developmental mechanisms of executive function and emotion regulation, this versatile analytic tool will be transformative to connectome data analysis across species, across the lifespan, and in health and disease. As part of tool development, the applicant will validate multiple NLA approaches using in silico connectome-behavior relationships and establish sensitivity and specificity of network level findings as compared to the connectome-wide control of familywise error rate (K99 Aim 1). The applicant will then establish test-retest reliability of NLA approaches using in vivo human connectome and behavioral data available from the HCP-Young Adult cohort (N=1105), and establish brain networks underlying healthy adult executive and emotional function (K99 Aim 2). During the independent R00 phase, she will then investigate changes in connectome architecture supporting the development of executive and emotional function using the ABCD longitudinal connectome and behavioral data (N=~11,000 age 9-14) (R00 Aim 3). During the K99 phase she will extend her training in behavioral neuroscience to include training in machine learning, longitudinal models, and computer science. Building on her strong foundation in human brain connectivity analysis, the applicant will gain advanced skills in biostatistics and best practices in software development to ensure her success as an independent researcher. The advisory committee, including Drs. Smyser (functional connectivity), Marcus (software engineering), Fair (developmental neuroscience), Todorov (biostatistics), Zhang (machine learning), Bassett (connectome analysis), Eggebrecht (toolbox development), and Barch (HCP/ABCD consultant) provide expertise in all core areas spanning experimental disciplines and possess an excellent record of obtaining independent funding and mentoring young scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE While significant research efforts have been devoted to determining the biological pathways of cognition and emotion, there is concern over the lack of reproducibility of findings. This proposal seeks to develop and apply a Network Level Analysis (NLA) toolbox which will be used to identify and characterize the brain networks underlying healthy and disordered development of executive and emotional processes. The NLA toolbox is a versatile analysis pipeline which leverages the structural and functional architecture of the brain and rigorous statistical testing and validation procedures to define brain-behavior relationships across species, across the lifespan, and in health and disease.",Innovative biostatistical approaches to network level analyses of connectome-behavior relationships,10055480,K99EB029343,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Endocrine', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Processes', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'cloud based', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'dimensional analysis', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional functioning', 'executive function', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'longitudinal design', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'skills', 'skills training', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development', 'young adult']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,126289,0.04716709426062499
"Towards Generating a Multimodal and Multivariate Classification Model from Imaging and Non-Imaging Measures for Accurate Diagnosis and Monitoring of Dementia in Parkinsons disease. PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the proposed research is to identify the best predictive biomarkers of dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PDD) through a multimodal and multivariate statistical model utilizing both neuroimaging derived measures (diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), and T1-weighted MRI measures) and non- imaging measures such as demographics (age, sex, years of education), clinical (disease duration and severity), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF-measures (Total Tau, β-Amyloid, α-synuclein). It is critical to identify biomarkers that can predict dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PD) as approximately 50-80% of PD patients develop PDD within twelve years of diagnosis. Identifying pathophysiology-based biomarkers that could identify PD patients at high risk for PDD reliably is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and better understanding the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project has two important components. The first component of the project is to understand the pathophysiological mechanism underlying PDD through sophisticated voxelwise dMRI-derived measures estimated using a multi-shell high angular and spatial resolution dMRI data acquisition, and understanding network-level white matter (WM)-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity in PDD. The second component of the project is to identify the biomarkers that predict PDD through multivariate statistical modelling by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures (such as clinical, demographics, genetics, and CSF-measures). We will recruit demographically matched healthy controls (HC) along with demographically, disease duration, and disease severity matched PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), PD-non-MCI (PD-nMCI), and PDD for this project. We will acquire multi-shell dMRI data at three b-values, namely 500s/mm2, 1000s/mm2, and 2500s/mm2 with a high angular and spatial resolution and estimate various unbiased free-water (fiso) corrected Gaussian dMRI-derived measures along with non-Gaussian dMRI-derived measures such as diffusion kurtosis measures, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging measures. We will further compare these measures between the groups to identify significant dMRI-derived measures separating the groups, and understanding the neuroanatomical correlates of these measures with various neuropsychological scores. Furthermore, we will estimate dMRI-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity to understand network-level discrepancies predicting PDD. These pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures will be further combined with various non-imaging measures through a novel machine learning algorithm to identify the comprehensive and best predictors of PDD. The tools developed in our proposal also has great potential for significantly advancing the understanding of other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) thereby helping to understand AD- and PD-specific neuroanatomical changes predicting dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is highly relevant to public health because identification of the Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients at a high-risk for developing dementia (PDD) is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and to better understand the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project identifies the best predictive biomarkers for PDD through examining the comprehensive Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion-MRI (dMRI)-derived white matter (WM) changes predicting PDD, examining the network-level discrepancies predicting PDD derived from dMRI-derived whole-brain structural connectivity and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI)-derived whole-brain functional connectivity, and developing a multivariate and multimodal statistical model by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures such as clinical (disease duration and severity), demographics (age, sex, years of education), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF- measures (β-Amyloid, α-Synuclein, tau) to identify the best predictive biomarkers of PDD through machine learning approach.

"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,9828783,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,555799,0.0019978356952043536
"Electrical connectomics: an innovative approach for dissecting brain mechanisms underlying behavioral states Project Summary: Understanding the mechanisms by which the brain encodes behavior presents a major challenge for developing effective therapies with which to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. The development of brain-wide measurements of neural connectivity in mammalian models holds great potential for overcoming this challenge. Here we propose an innovative approach for collecting and integrating such data across an unprecedented number of interconnected brain regions for use in elucidating the mechanisms by which sensory processing is altered in disease. A number of neurological and psychiatric disorders are triggered or exacerbated by sensory stimuli, yet little is understood about the brain connectivity underlying such sensory hyper/hypo- sensitization. Sensory processing plays a major role in the pathology of: autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, fibromyalgia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sensory perception disorders (SPDs), and migraine. Migraine in particular represents a compelling model of sensory hypersensitization, as the response to sensory stimuli is clear, dose- dependent, and measurable. Using state-of-the-art, multi-site in vivo recordings in a well- characterized migraine model, coupled with machine learning, we will develop network-wide electrical maps of the sensory hypersensitivity that underlies migraine. These networks will be validated for their roles in migraine using multiple behavioral assays and migraine-related pharmacological manipulations. We will additionally dissect the mechanisms underlying the sensory hypersensitivity brain state in a mouse model of migraine using optogenetic circuit manipulations as well as single-cell RNA-Seq, with the aim of identifying the contributions of specific circuits, cells, and molecules to this state. This approach is expected to substantially facilitate the use of neural oscillation-based brain networks in biomedical research, as well as provide: 1) a tool for rapid identification of a sensory hypersensitive brain state that can be tested for mechanisms shared across disorders, 2) a map of features of electrical brain networks, which serve as strong hypotheses regarding the routes whereby sensory hypersensitivity brain networks are regulated, and 3) insight into the contributions of specific cell types and molecules to the hypersensitive brain state. Collectively, this study is expected to provide insights into the etiology of migraine and other sensory hypersensitivity disorders that will be critical to developing brain network-based therapies for these diseases. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: This proposal seeks to harness a powerful approach for mapping electrical activity across the brain and to use this information to dissect the biological mechanisms underlying sensory hypersensitivity, a key aspect of many neurological and psychiatric disorders. The data collected from this study will provide a comprehensive map of electrical activity in sensory hypersensitivity in a preclinical migraine model; migraine is the most prevalent neurological disorder in the general population. These maps will then be used to identify novel brain-network based targets for the development of new therapeutics, establishing a unique approach that could be applied broadly to many brain disorders for which effective therapies remain elusive.",Electrical connectomics: an innovative approach for dissecting brain mechanisms underlying behavioral states,10001808,DP2MH126377,"['Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Etiology', 'Fibromyalgia', 'General Population', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Pathology', 'Perceptual Disorders', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Route', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Testing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cell type', 'effective therapy', 'hypersensitivity desensitization', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,DP2,2020,2317500,0.015133774468210076
"Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use Project Summary/Abstract  Insufficient knowledge of brain-based risk factors for problem cannabis use is a key barrier to identifying individuals at risk for cannabis-related harm and designing targeted prevention and early intervention approaches to promote positive development for persons at risk. The current proposal combines multiple, large- scale, neuroimaging datasets with novel densely-sampled fMRI data to identify a neuromarker of problem cannabis use and characterize its development prior to cannabis use onset, and in the context of current cannabis use in adolescence. We will apply a whole-brain, machine-learning method – connectome-based predictive modeling – to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use in a large sample of college students (Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students study; BARCS), and compare this network to canonical neural networks previously implicated in risk for cannabis use: frontoparietal, salience, and default mode networks. We will then examine the developmental trajectory of these cannabis risk networks in relation to other known risk factors for addiction prior to cannabis use onset in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, a nationally-representative sample of 11,875 children. We will examine whether individuals at high-risk for substance use problems (family history of substance use and exposure to early adversity) display a delay in the typical trajectory of network stabilization within cannabis risk networks. Finally, we will collect densely-sampled fMRI data (4 scans in 6 months) from 20 adolescents (age 15-17) who regularly use cannabis and 20 age- and sex-matched typically-developing adolescents. This study design will enable us to examine cannabis effects on short-term neural network dynamics and evaluate whether cannabis using adolescents are characterized by reduced stability of cannabis risk networks relative to their typically-developing peers. By combining multiple existing large-scale neuroimaging datasets with original, longitudinal, densely- sampled fMRI data, the proposed study design offers a unique opportunity to examine the interplay between neural mechanisms of risk for problem use and cannabis exposure effects on the developing adolescent brain and promises to yield important insights into the neural mechanisms of risk for problem cannabis use that can foster novel prevention and intervention initiatives to mitigate cannabis-related harms for individuals at high risk.  The current proposal also aims to provide Dr. Sarah Lichenstein with expert mentorship by Drs. Pearlson, Casey, Yip, Scheinost and Stevens to build the skills necessary to develop into an independent clinical scientist applying multimodal neuroimaging methods to study the pathophysiology of addiction. Dr. Lichenstein will pursue specialized training in studying cannabis effects on brain and behavior, big data science, and the conduct of research with adolescent participants. Furthermore, the collection of novel, densely-sampled, adolescent fMRI data will also provide Dr. Lichenstein with a rich and unique pilot dataset to support the submission of a R01 application by the end of the award period and facilitate her transition to an independent investigator. Project Narrative Cannabis use is extremely common and associated with clinically-significant negative outcomes for a subset of users, yet it is not currently possible to predict who is at highest risk for cannabis-related harms at the individual level. The current proposal aims to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use, and to characterize the development of this network both before and after cannabis use onset. Elucidating the neural basis of problem cannabis use will facilitate the development of novel prevention and early intervention efforts to mitigate potential cannabis-related harms for individuals at highest risk.",Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use,10038977,K08DA051667,"['18 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Cannabis', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Fostering', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol research', 'base', 'big-data science', 'brain behavior', 'brain research', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'design', 'early life adversity', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'peer', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'skills', 'university student']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,191700,0.0070647064734406925
"Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making ABSTRACT Evaluating risk and reward potential in the execution of motivated behaviors is important in decision-making. Positive valence systems in the brain encode positive stimuli and play a key role in motivation, reward expectance, and appetitive behavior. Negative valence systems, on the other hand, encode negative stimuli such as fear and anxiety, and drive avoidance. Critically, an imbalance in these valence systems is thought to underlie many core symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent studies have shown that the brain regions responsible for encoding these divergent valence systems have anatomical and functional overlap. This raises the hypothesis that differences in network-level activity involving these overlapping areas may discriminate information of positive and negative valence. Here, I propose to employ in vivo recordings of electrical activity across multiple brain regions concurrently as mice perform a behavioral task designed to probe both reward and aversion. This task, modeled after the classic elevated plus maze and sucrose preference tasks, will directly quantify the impact of anxiogenic stimuli on reward-motivated behavior. Using machine-learning techniques, I will then generate neural models that reflect the network-level activity engaged during the performance of this task. I anticipate that this strategy with discover an independent network that corresponds with the positive valence system, and another independent network that corresponds with the negative valence system. I also anticipate that I will discover a network that directly integrates network-level activity in these two systems to drive decisions making. Lastly, the structure of these networks will be validated in a cohort of mice that will be subjected to chronic social defeat stress. A validated model of MDD, chronic social defeat stress induces increased anxiety-like phenotypes and decreased reward drive in a subset of mice (stress-susceptible mice) while only increasing anxiety-like phenotypes in other animals (stress-resilient mice). Thus, successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a network-level understanding of positive and negative valence systems. Furthermore, the framework discovered through this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new revolutionary approaches for diagnosis and treatment of MDD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making Valence systems in the brain are responsible for encoding the response to positive and negative experiences. Altered interaction between positive and negative valence systems may play a role in the maladaptive behaviors observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Using in vivo recordings of electrical activity across key brain regions, we will uncover how the brain encodes reward and punishment at the network level.

"Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis ABSTRACT: Psychosis commonly develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Malfunctioning neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, are implicated in the disease progression of psychosis. Changes in brain glutamate in psychosis likely have several sources, as such, many frontline antipsychotic medications indirectly target the glutamate system and alleviate clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, monitoring in vivo alterations of the glutamate system within the brain are spatially limited by traditional magnetic resonance techniques. But, recently a novel 7T MRI technique (GluCEST) has shown that brain glutamate levels are lower across the brain in youth on the psychosis spectrum and patients with schizophrenia as compared to typically developing youth. Here, we propose to extend this novel work to directly measure glutamate within the brain of patients at risk for developing psychosis. Thus, this proposal is motivated by the need to better understand associations of brain neurochemistry, structure and function in both normal development and during early psychosis. In this study, we seek to 1) compare measures of glutamatergic development across the cortex in a cohort of typically developing (TD) youth, those at-clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and individuals with frank psychosis (PSY); 2) associate changes in brain glutamate with age- and diagnosis- related structural network changes in those at risk for developing psychosis; and 3) to establish comparison data of glutamate measures at 7T MRI (1HMRS vs. GluCEST). We will recruit and follow 35 TD, CHR and PSY over the 5-year funding period. Imaging data will be acquired at 7T and analyses will leverage recent advances in network science and machine learning. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of glutamate hypofunction in psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain development, such as disruptions in brain glutamate, during youth produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis,10050152,R01MH120174,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Glutamine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Motor', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protons', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adult', 'frontal lobe', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'trend', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,794181,0.05836169259492969
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9993927,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,454017,0.016344071794873585
"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,10004169,R01MH120158,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotional functioning', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'millisecond', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'preclinical study', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,713309,0.009063057618455023
"A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The metabolite and neurotransmitter profiles of neural tissues provide a unique window into brain’s physiological state and can be used to extract potential biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) allows simultaneous mapping and quantification of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters without exogenous contrast agents thus promised tremendous opportunities for molecular imaging of the brain. However, due to several fundamental technical challenges, including low SNR, poor spatial resolution, long imaging time and inaccurate separation of spectrally overlapping molecular signals, most in vivo MRSI studies to date are still limited to very low-resolution experiments (~1cm3 voxel size) with small brain coverages. The primary goal of this proposed research is to develop, optimize and evaluate a new framework to model, acquire and process MRSI data to enable simultaneous, high-resolution, whole- brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1, we will design and implement a novel acquisition strategy that synergistically combines SNR- efficient, multi-slab and multi-TE excitation, sparse sampling in a (k,t,TE)-space and optimized TE selection with maximum echo sampling to generate J-resolved (multi-TE) MRSI data with an unprecedented combination of speed, resolution and organ coverage. In Aim 2, we will develop novel nonlinear low-dimensional models of general MR spectra using a learning-based strategy that integrates the biochemical priors of neural tissues, known physics-based MRSI signal modeling and deep neural networks. These learned models will effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem and allow for significantly improved speed, resolution and SNR tradeoffs as well as signal separation. Novel computational solutions that effectively exploit the learned models and other spatial-spectral-TE constraints will be developed for spatiospectral reconstruction of metabolites and neurotransmitters from the noisy, high-resolution J-resolved MRSI data. Finally, in Aim 3, we will systematically evaluate the proposed technology in terms of speed, resolution, SNR, and quantitative accuracy using computer simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed technology for mapping metabolites and neurotransmitters in both healthy volunteers and temporal lobe epilepsy patients with mesial temporal sclerosis will be demonstrated. The success of the proposed research will lead to significant progress for in vivo MRSI and represent an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases. This tool, when fully developed, will add a transformative dimension to the existing neuroimaging technology profiles, with the potential to impact the diagnosis and management of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a potentially powerful modality that allows simultaneous mapping of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters noninvasively, which provide a unique window into brain’s physiological states and can be used to extract biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases. However, the current MRSI techniques do not provide the desired combination of resolution, imaging speed and organ coverage for many basic science and clinical applications. The proposed research will develop a new rapid, J-resolved MRSI technology to enable high-resolution, whole-brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time, which, if successful, will lead to significant progress for the field of MRSI and an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases.",A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping,10057847,R21EB029076,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging problem', 'Imaging technology', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sclerosis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'computerized data processing', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'healthy volunteer', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'potential biomarker', 'quantum', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,565546,0.007364767687706316
"Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome Project Summary In the healthy brain, large-scale white matter architecture and local neuronal membrane properties facilitate seamless transitions between cognitive states. Patients with schizophrenia display significant white matter abnormalities with disorganized brain activity. However, the degree to which dysfunctional brain activity in psychosis arises from structural or functional pathology remains unknown. The identification of conclusive neuroimaging findings in this cohort has been challenged by 1) inadequate methods to assess distributed multimodal pathological phenotypes, and 2) the significant pathogenetic heterogeneity in schizophrenia. Practically, the latter challenge can be in part addressed by the study of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS), where the prevalence of clinical schizophrenia is 25-fold higher than that of healthy individuals. The former challenge can be addressed by recent advances in network science and machine learning, which have generated insights about structure-function relationships in the healthy brain. Utilizing these methods to study the spectrum of psychotic symptoms in a population with a defined genetic lesion is a promising direction for investigating psychosis pathophysiology. In this proposal, we describe the development of a novel time-point-based analysis of functional neuroimaging data to study structure-function relationships in a sample of patients with 22qDS currently being seen at the Hospital for the University of Pennsylvania. Using neuroimaging data from a large sample of youths (n = 690) acquired through the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, our preliminary analyses demonstrate previously uncharacterized relationships between brain structure, brain activity, and working memory performance. In this proposal, we aim to 1) compare brain state transition dynamics across the psychotic spectrum of 22qDS, 2) compare structure-function coupling in 22qDS to healthy controls and relate structure-function coupling to psychotic symptom severity, and 3) relate state transition dynamics to working memory performance in 22qDS. A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of psychosis-spectrum symptoms would lay the groundwork for the development of targeted therapies for psychosis. Furthermore, utilizing a cohort with a known genetic lesion provides a unique opportunity to bridge our understanding of molecular mechanisms with neuroimaging biomarkers for psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Project Narrative Targeted, informed therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how complex patterns of brain activity arise from stationary white matter architecture. We propose to apply a novel method based on machine learning and network science to provide a new perspective on structure-function relationships in healthy controls as well as a sample of patients with psychosis secondary to chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Our study will leverage the presence of a consistent genetic lesion in this patient cohort to generate findings that could lay the groundwork for the development of interventions to restore healthy brain dynamics in individuals with psychosis-spectrum symptoms.",Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,9872025,F30MH118871,"['22q11.2', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Occupational', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Direction', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'University Hospitals', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'insight', 'learning network', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'preservation', 'psychotic symptoms', 'regional difference', 'selective attention', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2020,50520,0.01956883900458925
"Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex Project Summary This project will generate extensive new findings about cortical organization and connectivity in humans and nonhuman primates using high quality, multimodal datasets provided by our collaborators and by the young adult Human Connectome Project (YA-HCP). It will accelerate progress by freely sharing the resulting tools and experimental data with the scientific community. The first aim will provide a critically needed evaluation of non-invasive connectivity measures in relation to invasive anatomical tracers in macaque monkeys. Different methods for estimating fMRI-derived functional connectivity will be evaluated in order to determine which approach best correlates with `ground truth' tracer-based anatomical connectivity. This aim will also generate new insights about cortical evolution by comparing areal organization across humans, macaques, and marmosets using a novel approach in which areal features (myelin maps, resting-state networks, and identified homologous areas) constrain the registration between species. The second aim will focus on cortical organization in individual subjects using refined HCP-style analysis tools. It will optimize and evaluate intersubject alignment (using a recently developed Multimodal Surface Matching method) and individual-subject parcellation (using a machine learning based areal classifier). An important outcome will be recommendations of `best practice' for other projects that acquire less fMRI data than in the YA- HCP. These data will also be used to characterize individual variability of human cortical areas. For each of 180 areas, individual differences in size and topology (neighborhood relationships) will be examined for heritability and for symmetry across the two hemispheres. Additional analyses will reveal whether some areas are reproducibly absent in some individuals and whether `novel' areas are present in some subjects. The third aim is to enhance the capabilities of the Connectome Workbench visualization and analysis platform and the BALSA database that were introduced during previous grant periods. Enhancements to Connectome Workbench will: (i) enable non-invasive electrophysiological (MEG/EEG) and invasive neurophysiological data to be integrated with MRI data and atlas-based connectivity data (ii) facilitate interoperability across different atlases, (iii) improve interactive `HCP-style' analysis capabilities, and (iv) enable cortical layer-based analyses. Enhancements to the BALSA database include: (i) a WebGL-based web-viewer for interactive online visualization with special focus on the unique data generated by this project, (ii) an online spatial localization tool and (iii) support for uploading scene files to BALSA from 5 other software platforms besides Workbench. Relevance This project will evaluate the accuracy of noninvasive methods for estimating brain connectivity in humans and monkeys, compare areal organization across species, and characterize individual variability of cortical organization using a multimodal parcellation derived from the Human Connectome Project. Results will be shared via a state-of-the-art database that stores extensively analyzed data. These efforts will increase our understanding of normal human brain circuitry and organization and may ultimately contribute to better diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders.",Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex,9995177,R01MH060974,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Callithrix', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injections', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Neighborhoods', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Values', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical tool', 'anatomical tracing', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'denoising', 'design', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'young adult']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,650574,-0.0015460245826943097
"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) – herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),9985198,R24MH120037,"['Archives', 'Awareness', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'brain research', 'brain surgery', 'built environment', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data curation', 'data format', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'data structure', 'data submission', 'data tools', 'hackathon', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'repository', 'response', 'sensor', 'structured data', 'supercomputer', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web interface', 'web services', 'web site']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2020,900723,-0.023305314571114708
"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and machine learning algorithms in the future.   Project Narrative The Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive) is a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects.",A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive,9989180,R24MH114788,"['Archives', 'Atlases', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioconductor', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Familiarity', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Personnel Staffing', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'cloud storage', 'complex R', 'computerized data processing', 'data archive', 'data centers', 'data ecosystem', 'data ingestion', 'data integration', 'data pipeline', 'data resource', 'data standards', 'data submission portal', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multiple data types', 'multiple omics', 'neural circuit', 'next generation', 'online resource', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'public repository', 'query tools', 'repository', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'web site', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2020,1263611,0.04974541063229002
"Laboratory of Neuro Imaging Resource (LONIR) PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL The LONIR is focused on developing innovative solutions for the investigation of imaging, genetics, behavioral and clinical data. The LONIR structure is designed to facilitate studies of dynamically changing anatomic frameworks, e.g., developmental, neurodegenerative, traumatic, and metastatic, by providing methods for the comprehensive understanding of the nature and extent of these processes. Specifically, TR&D1 (Data Science) focuses on methodological developments for the management and informatics of brain and related data. This project will develop and issue new methods for robust scientific data management to create an environment where scientific analyses can be reproduced and/or enhanced, data can be easily discovered and reused, and analysis results can be visualized and made publicly searchable. TR&D2 (Diffusion MRI and Connectomics) seeks to advance the study of brain connectivity using diffusion imaging and its powerful extensions. This project will go beyond traditional tensor models of diffusion for assessing tissue and fiber microstructure and connectivity, develop tract-based statistical analysis tools using Deep Learning, introduce novel adaptive connectivity mapping approaches, using L1 fusion of multiple tractography methods, and provide mechanisms to study connectivity and diffusion imaging over 10,000 subjects. (This technology and these methods will be managed and executed by the TR&D1 framework to distributed datasets totaling over 10,000 subjects). Lastly, our TR&D3 (Intrinsic Surface Mapping) develops a general framework for surface mapping in the high dimensional Laplace-Beltrami embedding space via the mathematical optimization of their Riemannian metric. Our approach here overcomes fundamental limitations in existing methods based on spherical registration by eliminating the metric distortion during the parameterization step, thus achieving much improved accuracy in mapping brain anatomy. Coupled with a mature and efficient administrative structure and comprehensive training and dissemination, this program serves a wide and important need in the scientific community.

"Center for Mesoscale Mapping Overview of the Proposed Resource – Abstract The goal of the Center for Mesoscale Mapping is to drive the convergence of microscopic- and macroscopic- scale evaluation of brain structure and function for human translational neuroscience, by developing and applying tools to study the spatial distribution and temporal orchestration of mesoscopic events in the human brain. Our Collaborators will, through a dynamic “push-pull” relationship, provide unique problems which drive the development of these tools, and in return guide us in the design and optimization of our toolbox for practical use in a variety of normal and disease settings. While there is still no formal consensus on the definition of mesoscopic within the neuroscience community, we take as our guide the spatial and temporal scales at which local groups of neurons act in coherent fashion – in the cortex, this includes the spatial scale of columns and laminar structures (between ~0.1-1 mm), while in deeper structures includes the myriad of deep brain and brainstem nuclei. Preliminary data from our own center, and of course others throughout the world, now support the notion that we are on the threshold of being able to map, measure and perturb the human brain at these scales, and do so comprehensively across wide swaths of the human brain. Temporally too, recent advances suggest a convergence between temporal scales addressable with tools like fMRI, which can now investigate delta frequency coherent phenomena, and advanced electromagnetic tools to measure and perturb coherent electrophysiological activity at higher frequencies still. With this convergence in mind, the tools we proposed to develop within the TRDs of the CMM will provide our Collaborative and Service User community with the important “missing links” between the advances in human cognitive neuroscience at the “system level,” and the enormous strides in cellular level circuit functional characterization. Our Collaborators will bring their own unique challenges to help us define and further refine these tools, offering problems requiring distinct measures of human brain structural and functional properties in a variety of normal and disease settings. Our Service Users will utilize our tools to better understand human neural systems, and particularly human disease states from multiple sclerosis to Alzheimer’s, to depression and epilepsy. Finally, our Center will seek to disseminate these tools, through open-source software and hardware designs, industrial partnerships and “hands-on” teaching courses for hardware, and to train a new generation of human neuroscientists in the use of our advanced tools to explore the human brain at this next frontier.

"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,10004715,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'post-trauma', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2020,658730,0.04823505876450915
"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them.

Studying placebo treatments provides a window into these crucial context variables that will help understand vulnerability and resilience to mental health disorders and beyond.

"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9926317,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'comorbidity', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,838291,0.0468302969197324
"Neurocognitive deficits and compensation in binge drinkers ABSTRACT  Binge or heavy episodic drinking has been on the rise and is associated with a range of harmful consequences that scale up with the high intensity drinking prevalent among young adults. Evidence on the nature and extent of neural changes associated with binge drinking (BD) is scant, especially as regards sex differences, so more sensitive, high-precision imaging modalities are needed to examine persistent brain alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based methods are sensitive to brain function, as well as different neural tissue properties, and are well suited to provide multidimensional insight into the structure and organization of the brain. Despite a paucity of neuroimaging studies in BD, evidence obtained from individuals with alcohol use disorder suggests that degradation of prefrontal functions may contribute to impaired executive functions and an inability to refrain from hazardous drinking. Consistent with findings in alcohol use disorder, our data and other evidence indicate that BD participants show compensatory engagement of additional brain areas to maintain adequate performance on cognitively demanding tasks. Complementary MRI modalities can reveal the nature and regional specificity of structural degradation that underlies and constrains the compensatory reorganization.  The overall aim of this project is to use a range of MRI-based methods to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult binge drinking men and women. Because of their spatial precision and sensitivity to different neural tissue properties and functional features, MRI-based methods can provide insights into structural and functional alterations at the level of an interactive system. Specifically, BOLD fMRI will evaluate functional activation during tasks that probe cognitive control; resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis will examine alterations at the level of a functional network, while structural degradation will be reflected in gray and white matter morphometric features. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will characterize white matter microstructure and tract-based changes. These measures will be obtained from young adult men and women (18-30 yrs) who will be assigned to binge drinking (BD) and light drinking (LD) groups based on their drinking patterns and will be equated on age, race/ethnicity, and family history of alcoholism. Interactions between binge drinking and sex will be examined in all analyses. Overall, we hypothesize that neural alterations will correlate with a range of alcohol-related variables, with greater deficits and increased compensatory activity observed in BDs who engage in higher intensity drinking, with BD women being especially susceptible to functional deficits and structural degradation. Data will be integrated across imaging modalities in a machine learning classifier framework that will inform a predictive model of drinking trajectories based on 6-mos and 12-mos longitudinal follow-ups. Combined with a rich set of drinking indices, personality and behavioral variables, a constellation of brain measures will provide a mechanistic insight into the type and extend of the neural degradation underlying executive deficits and compensatory brain reorganization. NARRATIVE  The overall aim of this project is to use a multimodal MRI approach to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult men and women engaging in binge drinking.

"CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI Renewal CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Abstract Many studies have established strong relationships between cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), morphological and physiological brain changes, including stroke, and cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer disease and related disorders (ADRD). New physiological and functional MRI (fMRI) methods allow non- invasive measurement of regional cerebral blood flow, vascular reactivity and physiological brain connectivity. These techniques provide the means to evaluate the morphology, pathophysiology, and brain dysfunction related to CEVD and ADRD. The CARDIA Year 25 and Year 30 Brain MRI Substudies were designed to incorporate state-of-the-art MRI technology into the relatively younger population of CARDIA in order to determine MRI correlates of CVD risk factors and detect early CEVD. These studies documented early MRI changes of CEVD with strong correlations to CVD risk factors, particularly hypertension. The CARDIA Year 35 MRI Ancillary Study is intended to extend these earlier studies into the late middle age population of CARDIA. Most biomarkers of CEVD and ADRD are weakly expressed until approximately age 55, when they begin their precipitous rise to the steep slope evident in the 6th and 7th decades of life. Correspondingly, subclinical disease becomes clinically evident, reflected by increasing physiological changes and cognitive deficits. However, confounding the effects of CEVD are age, lifestyle, and co-morbidities, including ADRD. CARDIA, with its lengthy and rich historical data, is well-positioned to dissect the intricacies of CEVD and putative relationship to ADRD in the transition from middle age to seniority, starting at ages with few comorbidities and low medication use. Approximately 1044 participants will be enrolled in the Ancillary Study from the four participating Field Centers. MRI participants will be recruited from previous CARDIA Brain MRI participants and receive brain MRI scans and cognitive testing as defined for Y25 and Y30. Computer analysis of MRI data will be reported quantitatively by anatomic regions-of-interest. The primary objectives are to: 1) enhance statistical power to better document previously described and newly defined associations between demographic measures, risk factors and brain MRI findings, 2) define MRI parameters most strongly associated with clinical events and cognitive changes, and 3) identify early MRI biomarker patterns that inform disease pathophysiology and progression at an individual level. CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Project Narrative The CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI ancillary proposal will study the long-term associations between cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease risk factors, brain MRI findings, clinical events, and cognitive changes in young and mid adulthood as reflected in the CARDIA population. Early-onset and mid-life clinical events and cognitive changes in conjunction with a third brain MRI study and cognitive testing will allow us to define MRI pattern subtypes better reflecting pathophysiological variants reflective of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. The primary objectives are to: 1) enhance statistical power to better document previously described and newly defined associations between demographic measures, risk factors and brain MRI findings. 2) define MRI parameters most strongly associated with clinical events and cognitive changes reflective of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and 3) identify new, early MRI biomarker patterns that inform disease pathophysiology and progression at an individual level.",CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI Renewal,10017840,R01AG062819,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Ancillary Study', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Analysis', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'aging population', 'blood pressure regulation', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain volume', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'early onset', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'men', 'middle age', 'neuroimaging', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'sex', 'study population', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,1444766,0.014649557590221409
"THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ‘preterm behavioral phenotype’ is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ≤32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH This study is designed to improve our understanding of the changes in brain structure and function that underlie the elevated rates of inattention, anxiety and autism spectrum symptoms now increasingly recognized in prematurely-born children. Using cutting-edge magnetic resonance imaging methods, we will investigate these relationships in a unique, longitudinally-studied cohort of very preterm and term-born children with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10 years and previously studied using neuroimaging during infancy and detailed assessments of psychiatric symptoms during early childhood. The overarching goal is development of new approaches for earlier, more accurate identification of children at risk for these disorders, enabling progress toward targeted interventions which improve outcomes by limiting risks for psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity.",THE PRETERM BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE: TRAJECTORIES OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY & CHANGES IN CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9967154,R01MH113570,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Effect', 'Collection', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'middle childhood', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neonate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'psychiatric disability', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychosocial', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'social communication impairment', 'sociodemographics', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,614537,-0.0024960205926466456
"Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity This proposal describes a rigorous and comprehensive plan designed to obtain expert training in advanced MRI acquisition and analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and fetal programming of health and disease risk. The proposed research relates to the public health problem of childhood obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. Obesity is a multi-factorial phenotype. Among these factors, the critical importance of energy homeostasis (balance), and the hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates it, is well established. However, it is unclear whether the observed difference in this brain circuitry between obese and normal-weight individuals is a cause or consequence of the obese state. Also, relatively little is known about the developmental origin (fetal and early postnatal) of variation in this brain circuitry and its prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. My proposal addresses this fundamental knowledge gap. I advance the overarching hypothesis that energy homeostasis brain circuitry a) already is established by the time of birth; b) exhibits developmental plasticity (fetal programming); and c) is functionally relevant (predicts postnatal adipose tissue accrual). The K99 mentored phase will be conducted under the mentorship of leading experts in fetal programming of health and disease (P. Wadhwa), brain imaging (P. Thompson), and developmental systems neuroscience (D. Fair). I will first develop novel MRI-based measures of the newborn brain circuitry underlying energy homeostasis, and then identify the prenatal determinants of variation in this circuitry. The importance of focusing efforts on the newborn brain derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time is not yet influenced by postnatal factors. In the R00 phase, I will recruit a new cohort and use a repeated measures design to address the functional relevance of the initial (newborn) setting of this brain circuitry in the context of adipose tissue accrual over infancy (a key indicator of childhood obesity risk). K99/Aim 1. Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry, this aim will fulfill an important and as yet unmet need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also technical capability. K99/Aim 2. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology) determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are associated with infant adiposity. R00/Aim 3. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity risk. R00/Aim 4. Consider the complimentary hypothesis that infant adiposity at birth is prospectively associated with changes in newborn energy homeostasis brain circuitry. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan for the applicant, Dr. Jerod Rasmussen, to obtain expert training and conduct research that aims to identify novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, identify their gestational biology determinants, and determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood obesity. The identification of brain-related biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity,10022151,K99HD100593,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemical Shift Imaging', 'Cholesterol', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'data reduction', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'energy balance', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'metabolic rate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'obstetrical complication', 'population based', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'sex', 'skills', 'vector', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K99,2020,108600,0.0601567726299961
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood.

With this shifting demographic, adult CHD (ACHD) patients now outnumber pediatric CHD patients.1 ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits such as impairment in executive function, associated with reduced quality of life that includes deficits in educational attainment and social interaction.2-7 These deficits are related to risk factors that can occur across the lifespan, including genetic abnormalities, cumulative hypoxic/ischemic injury, and, adult-onset atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Our overarching hypothesis is that ACHD patients exhibit vascular brain injury and structural/physiological brain alterations that are predictive of specific neurocognitive deficits, including executive dysfunction, which are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR (e.g., level of education and lifestyle/social habits). We propose an ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD).” We will leverage the MINDS-ACHD parent study data (i.e., NIH Toolbox neuropsychological battery/clinical data/biological samples) and our established neuroimaging harmonization, which we currently use for the PHN Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVRIII) multi-center brain connectome study (R01-HL128818; PI-Panigrahy), to measure neuroimaging biomarkers in ACHD patients at the same PHN sites. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim #1 (brain injury): To determine if vascular-related brain injury (cortical infarcts, hemosiderin lesions, and white matter hyperintensity) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox total composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #2 (brain structure): To determine if reduced fronto-temporal cortical thickness and white matter connectivity are associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox frontal executive sub-score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #3 (brain physiology): To determine if reduced cerebrovascular reserve (regional cerebral blood flow/ resting BOLD imaging) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox crystallized composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #4 (cognitive reserve): To determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. Given the paucity of multi-modal neuroimaging studies in ACHD, our proposed study addresses a major knowledge gap in the ACHD population by providing insight into the mechanism underlying impaired neurocognitive outcomes. Our study will provide structural-physiological correlates of neurocognitive outcomes, representing the first multi-center neuroimaging study to be performed in ACHD. Importantly, other behavioral and environmental enrichment data will be integrated with these neuroimaging and neurocognitive outcome data to model cognitive reserve. Results from this research will help shape the care of ACHD patients, and further our understanding of the interplay between brain injury and cognitive reserve. The proposed ancillary study is thus both feasible and cost-effective by leveraging the NHLBI-PHN infrastructure As such, the proposed research is well aligned with the NHLBI's Strategic Vision. Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) now outnumber children with CHD. ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits and reduced quality of life, including lower educational attainment and less social interaction. The mechanism of neurocognitive impairment in the ACHD population is unknown and few neuroimaging studies in this population exist. We propose a multi-modal neuroimaging ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study” (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease to correlate multi-modal neuroimaging biomarkers in relation to neurocognitive outcome. We will also determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of cognitive reserve, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. These ACHD studies will foster development of future clinical translational studies or trials of preventive strategies to improve neurocognitive outcome in this population.",MINDS Imaging Ancillary Study,10001823,R01HL152740,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ancillary Study', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Trauma', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Common Ventricle', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Educational Background', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Habits', 'Heart', 'Hemosiderin', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life Style', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Translational trial', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'aged', 'brain abnormalities', 'cerebrovascular', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'executive function', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'ischemic injury', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'prevent', 'protective factors', 'randomized trial', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'translational study', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,526873,0.025877921327739358
"Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity This revised application, submitted in response to NIH PA-18-741 “Secondary Analyses in Obesity,  Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,” relates to the public health problem of childhood  obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, determinants and role of energy balance  homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. The proposal describes a comprehensive  plan designed to advance neonatal MRI analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and  fetal programming of health and disease risk. The critical importance of the  hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates energy homeostasis is well  established, and MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuits have been  associated with obesity outcomes. However, it is unclear whether the observed differences in these  brain regions and circuitry in obese relative to normal-weight individuals are a cause,  consequence, or both, of the obese state. Moreover, relatively little is known about the  developmental ontogeny of these brain regions and circuitry, particularly during the fetal period,  and their prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. This project addresses  this fundamental knowledge gap. We will develop novel measures and conduct analyses using newborn  brain imaging and other data elements from 4 inter-linked NIH-funded projects on prenatal stress  and fetal programming of brain development and infant body composition (R01 HD-060628; R01  MH-091351; R01 HD-065825; UG3 OD-023349). The importance of selecting the newborn brain as the  starting time point derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time could not yet have  been influenced by postnatal factors such as diet/feeding, thereby enabling the study to  disentangle the temporality of effects. In a recent position paper on the pathogenesis of obesity,  the U.S. Endocrine Society emphasized the need to conceptualize obesity as a disorder of the  energy homeostasis system and elucidate its underlying mechanisms and developmental influences.  Towards this objective, and using a population of ~100 mother-infant dyads followed from early  gestation through birth till 5 yrs age, we will integrate research aims that leverage the resources  of these projects to advance our understanding of the origins of childhood obesity. Aim 1.  Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional  MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry,  this aim will fulfill an important need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also  technical capability. Aim 2. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these  novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human  newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity  and subsequent childhood obesity risk. Aim 3. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology)  determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are  associated with infant adiposity. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of  energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately  provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of  childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan to conduct research that aims to identify  novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn,  determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood  obesity, and identify their gestational biology determinants. The identification of brain-related  biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment  will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early  identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity,9959421,R21DK118578,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Body Composition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Endocrine', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'clinically significant', 'connectome', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'energy balance', 'feeding', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'follow-up', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'inter-individual variation', 'interest', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'obstetrical complication', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'vector', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R21,2020,158513,0.05656164304403506
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9954064,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,690910,0.011118310085147326
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia.

"Developmental Variations in Corticostriatal Thalamocortical Circuits and their Relationship to Psychopathology ABSTRACT Detailed characterizations of brain development are essential to understanding factors underlying the emergence of psychopathology and its progression. Corticostriatal thalamocortical (CSTC) circuits are central to current models of both externalizing and internalizing psychopathologies. However, our understanding of their development and the impact of pathologic processes on these circuits is primarily limited to regional structural properties and specific disorders (e.g., Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). As such, there is a need for a more comprehensive examination of CSTC circuit development and its relations to psychopathology. The overarching goals of the proposed work are to characterize the development of CSTC circuits using structural MRI and resting state functional MRI, and to link variations in their trajectories to the emergence of psychopathology. We will model developmental trajectories of structural morphology and functional interactions within seven CSTC networks defined based on their connectivity with large-scale cortical networks and relate deviations to externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Consistent with recent calls for secondary analysis of existing datasets to accelerate the identification of brain-behavior relationships that may serve as modifiable clinical targets, the proposed work will make use of openly shared pediatric imaging datasets (ages: 5.0-24.0; high resolution T1 anatomical and resting state functional scans for each participant). Specifically, we will generate a large-scale aggregate cross-sectional sample (n = 3918) for the purposes of delineating trajectories for the seven CSTC networks. We train age-prediction models for each of the networks and pool their predictions to generate multivariate CSTC maturity profiles for each individual. These profiles will be used to subtype individuals into neurobiologically homogenous subgroups, which are expected to differ with respect to dimensional measures of psychopathology calculated using the bifactor model framework (i.e. general psychopathology [p-factor], internalizing, externalizing). An aggregate longitudinal sample (n = 250; 3 time- points per participant, each 12-15 months apart) will be generated to evaluate the ability of changes in CSTC maturity profiles over time to predict longitudinal changes in psychopathology. Specific aims of the proposed work are to: 1) Estimate the developmental trajectories of seven CSTC networks; 2) Determine associations between CSTC network maturity profile subtypes and dimensions of psychopathology; and 3) Evaluate predictive relationships between longitudinal changes in maturity profiles and those in dimensions of psychopathology. Given the scale of the datasets employed, cloud-based computing, and optimized analytic frameworks will be leveraged to ensure the feasibility of achieving the proposed work within the project period. All codes developed will be openly shared. NARRATIVE We will characterize developmental trajectories of corticostriatal-thalamocortical circuits, which are critical for the acquisition and refinement of behavior, and widely implicated in psychiatric and neurological disorders. We develop growth charts for these circuits and assess how deviations relate to the emergence of psychopathology in children and adolescents.",Developmental Variations in Corticostriatal Thalamocortical Circuits and their Relationship to Psychopathology,9840942,R21MH118556,"['Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Properdin', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Sex Differences', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'learning network', 'machine learning method', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'secondary analysis', 'sex']",NIMH,"CHILD MIND INSTITUTE, INC.",R21,2020,198621,0.0013774419640208645
"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology.

"New Photo-Acoustic Imaging Process in Fetal Monitoring to Dramatically Reduce Brain Injuries in Newborns PROJECT SUMMARY Summary The Brimrose Technology Corporation and Johns Hopkins University are forming a powerful new team to make a new instrument that has the potential to dramatically reduce a major global health problem–perinatal hypoxic- ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)–by enabling early detection during labor. HIE caused by asphyxia is a leading cause of infant fatalities as well as a source of cerebral palsy and other long-term severe neurologic impairments. The medical community has been limited in early diagnosis of HIE because current fetal heart rate monitoring has poor specificity. If identified early, HIE can be treated effectively with therapeutic hypothermia. We are proposing a fetal photoacoustic monitoring system that measures oxyhemoglobin saturation of the sagittal sinus vein draining the fetal cerebral cortex during labor. Sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation decreases to very low levels when placental gas exchange is impaired (hypoxia) and/or when fetal cerebral perfusion pressure falls (ischemia). The photoacoustic instrument transmits light through the open fontanelle or bone and into cerebral veins and tissue where ultrasound waves are generated. Using near- infrared incident light at discrete wavelengths that are absorbed preferentially by oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, ultrasound detected on the fetal scalp at each wavelength can estimate oxyhemoglobin saturation. Brimrose has constructed a novel ultrasound detection technology with sensitivity orders of magnitude greater than the current best-use piezo-electric sensors. This will permit the use of low-power LED light sources rather than cumbersome laser lights now employed, thereby avoiding safety goggle use and promoting greater deployment. The Hopkins team has already validated the ability of a standard photoacoustic system to accurately estimate sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation through the skull of newborn piglets. The purpose of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of using safe, low power LED light sources with the new ultrasensitive ultrasound sensor to detect critically low sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation when oxygenation is manipulated. The platform will be based on in-silico simulation to optimize the acoustic and optical pathways for the skull and brain. Real-time measurements on a time scale of seconds will inform the obstetric caregiver of dynamic fluctuations of brain oxygenation during contractions. The Phase II goal is to make a miniaturized photoacoustic device prototype that can report on fetal brain oxygenation. We believe the resulting instrument will provide early detection brain HI with greater specificity and sensitivity, enabling early intervention and treatment and is potentially transferrable to a commercial model for manufacture. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Brimrose Technology Corporation and the Johns Hopkins University propose making a new instrument to potentially dramatically reduce the incidence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), which can result in mortality or lifelong disabilities. Our goal is to develop an intrapartum fetal brain monitor using photoacoustics with inexpensive, safe and clinically convenient light emitting diodes (LEDs) to noninvasively and instantaneously identify the fetus at risk for brain injury. Phase I is intended to provide a proof-of-concept using low power LED light sources and a novel ultrasensitive ultrasound detector rather than standard laser light sources and piezo-electric detectors.",New Photo-Acoustic Imaging Process in Fetal Monitoring to Dramatically Reduce Brain Injuries in Newborns,10010328,R43HD102260,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Aluminum', 'Animals', 'Asphyxia', 'Auscultation', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebral perfusion pressure', 'Cerebrum', 'Cesarean section', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electricity', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoxia', 'Imaging Device', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic acidosis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neodymium', 'Neonatal', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Oxyhemoglobin', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perinatal anoxic ischemic brain injury', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sagittal Sinus', 'Scalp structure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structure of fontanel of skull', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonic wave', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Yttrium', 'absorption', 'base', 'bone', 'cerebral oxygenation', 'cerebral vein', 'chromophore', 'commercialization', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'cranium', 'detector', 'disability', 'energy density', 'falls', 'fetal', 'fetal brain injury', 'fetus at risk', 'global health', 'hazard', 'heart rate monitor', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intrapartum', 'light scattering', 'machine learning method', 'microphone', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'natural hypothermia', 'neonatal brain', 'neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury', 'novel', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'sound', 'temporal measurement', 'virtual']",NICHD,BRIMROSE TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION,R43,2020,74989,0.01609875459647679
"Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging Project Summary. Neuroimaging is poised to take a substantial leap forward in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of human behavior, due to a combination of improved analytic techniques and the quality of imaging data. These advances are allowing researchers to develop population-level multivariate models of the functional brain representations underlying behavior, performance, clinical status and prognosis, and other outcomes. Population-based models can identify patterns of brain activity, or `signatures', that can predict behavior and decode mental states in new individuals, producing generalizable knowledge and highly reproducible maps. These signatures can capture behavior with large effect sizes, and can be used and tested across research groups. However, the potential of such signatures is limited by neuroanatomical constraints, in particular individual variation in functional brain anatomy. To circumvent this problem, current models are either applied only to individual participants, severely limiting generalizability, or force participants' data into anatomical reference spaces (atlases) that do not respect individual functional topology and boundaries. Here we seek to overcome this shortcoming by developing new topological models for inter-subject alignment, which register participants' functional brain maps to one another. This will increase effective spatial resolution, and more importantly allow us to explicitly analyze the spatial topology of functional maps make inferences on differences in activation location and shape across persons and psychological states. We will test and validate the methods using a purpose-designed experiment (n = 120) that includes two types of naturalistic narrative experiences (movies and audio stories) and tasks from three functional domains (pain, emotion, and cognition). The tasks are designed with several constraints in mind, including: (1) systematic coverage of cognitive, emotional, and sensory tasks matched in stimulus properties (e.g., stimulus duration); and (2) multiple levels of task demand within each task, to permit parametric modeling and prediction of demand levels. We will compare our new methods to existing methods based on out-of-sample effect sizes in predicting behavior and test-retest reliability. We will make the analytic methods, software, and dataset available to other researchers, along with a library of functional reference spaces for multiple psychological states. Project Narrative. We develop new methods for enhancing the development of models that can predict behavior, clinical status, and other outcomes using neuroimaging data. Successful development will help improve the translational impact of neuroimaging. It will also contribute to developing multidisciplinary neuroscience, by promoting the development of neural signatures for specific mental processes in humans with increased precision and specificity.",Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging,9908089,R01EB026549,"['Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Charon', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gaussian model', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Processes', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Wages', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'mental state', 'model development', 'movie', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'statistics', 'translational impact']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,667005,0.019798457228031363
"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions. The starting point of the project is our earlier discovery that phase structure in oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) of hippocampal areas CA1/CA3 carry location information in exquisite detail (Agarwal et al. 2014). We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations. The computational description level will leverage ideas of vector symbolic architectures, a class of connectionist models originally proposed for describing cognitive reasoning (Plate, 1995; Kanerva, 1996). Models produced by the software tool will concisely encapsulate assumptions about the computation and its implementation of a brain function and produce predictions that can be tested in a next generation of recording experiments. The proposed theory framework will be tested in building models for navigation in hippocampus and for visual processing in areas V1 and V4 in cortex. Project narrative: A key difficulty with inferring brain function from recordings of neural activity in a working brain is that the dynamics of individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Here we address this problem by delivering new tools for decoding and decomposing neural population activity, leveraging the recent discovery by the PI of behavior-specific phase structure of local field potentials. Further, we provide software and a theoretical framework for describing models of brain function on a computational and mechanistic level that can produce testable predictions for a new generation of brain recording experiments.",Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings,9999578,R01EB026955,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Encapsulated', 'Fostering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'area V1', 'area V4', 'base', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'independent component analysis', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'presynaptic', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'visual processing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,20198,0.011199015237452564
"Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks The mammalian brain is believed to be optimally designed for robust and adaptable computation of the sensory inputs from the world, with respect to both its hardware (network structure) and software (network dynamics). The precise connections between the intricate structural connectivity and the rich network dynamics, however, are yet unknown. Moreover, our understanding of how the network structure and dynamics shape (or are shaped by) underlying coding principles in the brain network, is limited. My research plan proposes to close this gap by leveraging rich dataset obtained by state-of-art experimental techniques at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and innovative mathematical methods.  Specifically, my project aims to 1) link network structure and dynamic information processing in the brain, and to 2) bridge the gap between detailed biophysiological mechanisms and overarching neural coding principles with a focus on predictive coding theory, using data-driven mathematical models. To address Aim 1, I will investigate how network dynamics measured by synchronizability, metastability, and integrated information depend on local and global structure of the network. I will then study whether the experimentally obtained mouse brain connectome has optimal connectivity structures for unique dynamical characteristics. These analyses will be extended to the cell-type and layer-specific brain connectivity, based on the latest Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity data obtained from Cre-transgenic mice. During the independent phase, I will investigate whether brain-like networks can be evolved from optimization of dynamic measures. Regarding Aim 2, I will analyze data obtained from my current collaborative project which experimentally tests predictive coding models in the mouse visual cortex. In this study, we measure neural activity in response to expected and unexpected sequences of natural stimuli across three hierarchically related areas. Upon completion of the experiments, during the mentored phase, I will investigate mapping of algorithmic units in predictive coding models to neuronal populations in different layers. During my independent career period, I will extend the predictive coding model to incorporate active sensing and thalamo-cortical circuitries.  The project during the mentored phase will be carried out at the University of Washington which provides a highly interdisciplinary environment and offers the ideal training for me to become an independent researcher. I will also have access to rich resources and outstanding collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. I will have two mentors, one from the University of Washington and another from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. This unique setup will allow me to study mathematical models based on experimental data obtained by cutting-edge techniques with guidance from mentors with strong theoretical backgrounds. With theories closely tied to experiments, I believe my proposed project will contribute to our understanding of the connection between structure and computation of the neuronal network, addressing BRAIN initiative’s high priorities. The proposed research aims to probe how adaptable sensory coding arises from intricate connectivity structure and dynamics of the brain network at multiple scales. This study will contribute to our understanding of connections between unique structure and dynamics of the brain network as well as the mapping of complex neuronal dynamics in the cortical circuitry to algorithmic nodes in predictive coding models. By combining cutting-edge experimental and theoretical tools, this project will contribute to identifying fundamental principles underlying emergence of cognition and perception from neuronal network dynamics.","Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks",10000156,K99EY030840,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive control', 'collaborative environment', 'connectome', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'object recognition', 'predictive test', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'theories', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,128619,0.022198821894111553
"RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data Project Summary/Abstract  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allows the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded. We use the term ECOG to refer to the entire range of invasive recording techniques (from subdural strips and grids to penetrating electrodes) that share the common attribute of recording neural activity from the human brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. While this ability has resulted in many high-impact advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain function in health and disease, it generates staggering amounts of data as a single patient can be implanted with hundreds of electrodes, each sampled thousands of times a second for hours or even days. The difficulty of exploring these vast datasets is the rate-limiting step in using them to improve human health. We propose to overcome this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the unique properties of ECOG. We dub this software tool RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).  The first goal of Aim 1 is to release RAVE 1.0 to the entire ECOG community by month 6 of the first funding period. This will maximize transformative impact by putting the new tools in the hands of users as quickly as possible, facilitating rapid adoption. The design philosophy of RAVE is driven by three imperatives. The first is to keep users ""close to the data"" so that users may make discoveries about the brain without being misled by artifacts. The second imperative is rigorous statistical methodology. The final imperative is ""play well with others"". As described in Aim 2, our approach will make it easy to seamlessly incorporate new and existing analysis tools written in Matlab, C++, Python or R into RAVE, giving users the best of both worlds: advanced but easy-to-use visualization of results from ECOG experiments, whether they are analyzed with the off-the- shelf tools routines provided with RAVE or novel tools developed by others.

"Longitudinal Mapping of Network Development Underlying Executive Dysfunction in Adolescence ABSTRACT  Executive function (EF) undergoes dramatic development during adolescence, and is impaired across multiple psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Despite this fact, the neural substrates of EF development remain incompletely understood. Here, we propose to study the development of EF using cutting- edge techniques from network science. In this proposal, we will recruit 140 participants ages 10-16. This sample will include 50 with ADHD, 50 with psychosis-spectrum diagnoses, and 40 typically developing comparators. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, all participants will be followed and undergo cognitive testing, clinical assessment, and advanced multi-modal neuroimaging at 18 month intervals, yielding an average of 2.5 sessions per participant. This design will allow us to chart the development of structural and functional brain networks during adolescence, and delineate how abnormalities of brain network development are associated with deficits in EF performance, activation, and dynamics. Our overarching hypothesis is that the development of modular yet integrated brain networks during adolescence allows for specific patterns of EF activation and dynamics, and represents a fundamental mechanism for EF development. We posit that abnormalities of network development will be associated with executive dysfunction that is dimensionally present across psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and psychosis. Accordingly, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will chart the longitudinal development of both structural and functional brain networks, and define how abnormalities of network development are associated with dimensional EF deficits in youth with ADHD and psychosis. In Aim 2, we will define how abnormal development of brain network topology is associated with alterations of executive activation and dynamics. In Aim 3, we will integrate high-dimensional imaging data using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to create a dimensional predictor of executive dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 4, we will share both raw and processed data, creating a valuable new resource for the neuroscience community. This proposal capitalizes on complementary skills of the PIs and the research team, including expertise in brain development, network science, psychopathology, cognitive science, and high dimensional imaging statistics. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of executive dysfunction across psychiatric disorders in adolescence. RELEVANCE Executive function is an important domain of cognition that develops rapidly during adolescence, and is impacted by multiple psychiatric disorders including ADHD and psychosis. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain network development produce executive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments.

"Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method of focally stimulating the brain that uses electromagnetic induction and does not require surgery. There is optimism that TMS will revolutionize how we treat neurological and psychiatric disorders, evidenced by over 1000 clinical trials registered using TMS. Much of this optimism stems from the successful use of TMS as a treatment for depression. Despite the large number of clinical trials using TMS the number of therapeutic indications has been stagnant, limited to major depression and more recently obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are fundamental questions about the underlying mechanisms of action for TMS that will be critical to understand in order to advance this treatment modality. Here, we propose a unique collaborative project between neurology and neurosurgery that will allow an unprecedented window into understanding how TMS impacts the human brain. Specifically, we will perform TMS in neurosurgical patients with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) monitoring to record real time effects of TMS on local and remote brain areas with an unparalleled combination of spatial and temporal resolution relative to other human studies. We have already demonstrated the safety of this approach using a gel-based phantom brain and have results from seven patients demonstrating safety and preliminary results. For the current proposal we aim to: 1) characterize the response of TMS on the human brain as recorded from iEEG between active and sham conditions, and 2) relate remote electrophysiological responses induced by TMS to measures of brain connectivity between the stimulation and recording sites assessed with resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI). This will allow us to evaluate the relationship between TMS-evoked iEEG responses and the strength of functional connectivity to the stimulation site in a regression model. We hypothesize that: 1) TMS will have focal effects detected from surface electrodes underlying the stimulation site as well as network-level engagement detected at remote sites, 2) Repetitive TMS will induce frequency- specific effects that differ between 0.5 and 10 Hz stimulation protocols, and 3) the magnitude of repetitive TMS-evoked iEEG responses across electrodes will relate to the strength of rs-fcMRI between the stimulation and recording sites. By investigating the electrophysiological responses of TMS with high spatiotemporal precision in humans, this study will provide new mechanistic insights into the effects of TMS on target engagement and relate these findings to imaging methods already in widespread use. Moreover, the TMS will be applied in a clinically meaningful way by targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a protocol used to treat depression. Generating results for these aims will be key to advancing our understanding of how TMS engages brain networks, which can be leveraged to rationally develop personalized, imaging-guided therapeutic TMS for depression and other disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will help our understanding of how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) affects the brain. We will develop a new method of measuring TMS-induced changes in brain activity with high spatial and temporal accuracy that is only possible with intracranial recording. The research will shed light on the mechanism of TMS and facilitate the development of better interventions and treatments for psychiatric diseases.",Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans,9971584,R21MH120441,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurology', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cranium', 'field study', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optimism', 'programs', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'stem', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2020,193125,-0.002665046010400165
"Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging PROJECT SUMMARY Prevalent, morbid, and costly ($66 billion/year in 2007), incontinence is a major problem, especially for older adults, in whom the most common type is urgency incontinence (UUI). Generally ascribed to bladder spasms, UUI's actual causes are unknown, and therapy remains inadequate. Recent data suggest that one cause is poor bladder control by the brain. In our recent R01 we used biofeedback (BFB) as a probe to explore this. The exciting findings suggest that one `phenotype' of UUI in older adults seems to be caused by a breakdown in brain control, which can be restored by successful behavioral therapy, while another is refractory. Our proposed new study will explore this further by attempting to differentiate the mechanisms associated with disease and aging. The goal is to identify which brain mechanisms should be suppressed because they are contributing to or causing UUI, which should be enhanced because they are helping to compensate for UUI, and which should be ignored because they are incidental to aging and not related to UUI. Current data suggest that bladder control comprises 3 cerebral circuits that maintain continence by suppressing the voiding reflex in the midbrain. In our UUI phenotype that responded to BFB, the mechanism involved enhancing deactivation of the first brain circuit (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) which resulted in less activation of the second circuit (which includes the midcingulate cortex). In the phenotype that was resistant to BFB, no brain changes were seen. Yet, although we have an emerging picture of the brain's role in UUI, we have only rudimentary understanding of what is `normal', i.e. how the brain normally controls the bladder. More relevant, we do not know whether this control mechanism is the same across the lifespan, or if it changes owing to the impact of aging. Thus, our overall aim is to characterize continence control in both young and old people, and examine how changes due to bladder control failure differ in each age group. Our specific aims are to characterize normal voiding in the continent old and young in order to better understand and verify the working model and to use the comparison to older adults with UUI to understand the mechanism of brain failure in these individuals. To address these aims, we will conduct a detailed clinical and neuroimaging study to study 80 asymptomatic women and 80 UUI women, each group divided equally into young (18-45) and old (65+ years). The study will enable us to evaluate the changes in brain structure and function and to identify brain mechanisms involved in continence control, changes due to aging (both benign and contributory to UUI), and changes due to disease. The study will provide the comprehensive data on brain mechanisms involved in the normal continence mechanism in order to better corroborate our working model, understand the aging process, and assess targets for therapy. It will thereby enable scientists to develop novel and more effective new therapies based on the revolution in neuroscience—and more hope for UUI sufferers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Urge urinary incontinence is a common problem in older people which vastly reduces quality of life, yet the cause and mechanism of disease are not well understood. This study will characterize brain control of the bladder in young and old continent individuals and age-matched wet counterparts. This will expand our current knowledge of how the brain controls the bladder, better characterize the `ideal' mechanism and suggest ways in which we can better target treatment.",Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging,10050097,R01AG065288,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Biofeedback', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Control', 'Bladder Dysfunction', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Incidence', 'Incontinence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Micturition Reflex', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Premenopause', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Refractory', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Spasm', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Urge Incontinence', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Woman', 'age group', 'age related', 'aged', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'innovation', 'micturition urgency', 'mind control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,624134,-0.028284266904789496
"CRCNS: Common algorithmic strategies used by the brain for labeling points in high-dimensional space The first major goal of this work is to learn how certain brain regions (olfactory system,  hippocampus, and cerebellum) learn very complex stimuli that employ a combinatorial code to  identify stimuli as points in a high-dimensional space. For example, the simple fruit fly  olfactory system uses the firing rates of 50 different types of odorant receptors to  identify each odor by placing it at a point in a SO-dimensional space. Although the fly olfactory  system is well understood, less is known about analogous regions in vertebrate brains, and our  goal is to begin to learn about these other regions. The first step is to start with the mouse olfactory system that is similar to the fly in some ways but has complexities that are  absent in insects. These complexities include an enhanced ability to handle noise in the  odor and to learn over time to discriminate between very similar odors (e.g., two types of  red wines). Preliminary evidence shows that it should be possible to learn the role of  these complexities in vertebrate olfaction. The research design involves studying the  anatomy and recording the firing rates of different types of neurons at different levels of the  mouse olfactory system and in applying computational methods and algorithms that have  proved successful in earlier work to describe these complexities. The second major goal is to use insights into how these brain regions operate to improve the  function of computer algorithms. For a long time, a dream of many neuroscientists and computer  scientists has been to understand how the brain works well enough that we could translate insights  from the brain to improve machine computation. Indeed, experience has shown that the brain   has evolved novel variations of information processing algorithms used by computer  scientists to solve general computational problems. With sufficient insight into algorithms  used by the brain, these insights may provide unexpected ways to improve the function computer  science algorithms. Further, understanding the circuit mechanisms involved in olfactory processing can help illuminate the basis of a variety of smell disorders, and may  in the future lead to the construction of artificial smelling devices. Our main goal is to understand what computations are used by the mammalian olfactory system; this  has two types of public relevance. First, we hope to learn what circuit mechanisms are used in  this brain region, which may help identify how disruption of these mechanisms causes  brain and olfactory malfunction. Second, we hope to improve computer performance by using insights into how the brain computes.",CRCNS: Common algorithmic strategies used by the brain for labeling points in high-dimensional space,9994975,R01DC017695,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Burn injury', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Dreams', 'Drosophila genus', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fire - disasters', 'Fruit', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Olfaction Disorders', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'combinatorial', 'computational basis', 'computer science', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learning community', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preservation', 'red wine', 'response', 'theories']",NIDCD,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2020,446764,0.02548449076893092
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Towards integrated 3D reconstruction of whole human brains at subcellular resolution Project Summary A detailed understanding of the anatomical and molecular architectures of brain cells and their brain-wide organization is essential for interrogating human brain function and dysfunction. Extensive efforts have been made toward mapping brain cells through various lenses, which have established invaluable databases yielding new insights. However, integrative extraction of the multimodal properties of various cell-types brain-wide within the same brain, crucial to elucidating complex intercellular relationships, remains nearly impossible. We have developed high-throughput, cost-effective technology platforms to create a fully integrated three-dimensional (3D) human brain cell atlas by simultaneously mapping high-dimensional features (e.g., spatial, molecular, morphological, and microenvironment information) of all cells acquired from the same whole brain. The proposed work will establish the most comprehensive 3D human brain map to date, with unprecedented resolution and completeness. We envision that this atlas will facilitate the integration of a broad range of studies and allow the research community to interrogate human brain structure and function at multiple levels. In Aim 1, we will apply a novel technology to transform whole human brain tissue into indestructible hydrogel–tissue hybrids that allow highly multiplexed molecular labeling and subcellular-resolution volume imaging. In Aim 2, we will apply scalable labeling and imaging technologies to map the brain-wide 3D distribution of various cell-type and structural markers at subcellular resolution within the same brain. Our chemical engineering–based approach to this aim will enable cost-effective, lossless 3D labeling of the entire human brain at lower cost as traditional subsampling approaches. True volume labeling and subcellular-resolution imaging will allow us to extract fine morphological and connectivity information from labeled cells and reconstruct the microenvironment of all cells. In Aim 3, we will use a host of rapid and highly automated algorithms to perform unbiased, integrative high- dimensional phenotyping of all cells based on their spatial location, molecular expression, morphology, and microenvironment. In Aim 4, we will perform super-resolution phenotyping of cells in a selected brain region from the same sample used in Aim 3 to map inter-areal axonal connectivity at single-fiber resolution and to characterize chemical synapses. This integrative approach will likely unveil unique cell-types and brain regions, a crucial step toward a better understanding of brain function. The complete 3D dataset will be linked to magnetic resonance and diffusion spectrum images and existing reference atlases to facilitate the integration of a wide breadth of study at multiple levels and to make the data publicly accessible for mining and analysis. A detailed picture of the human brain’s complex intermolecular, intercellular, and interareal interactions is of paramount importance for understanding its function and dysfunction. However, the immense complexity of the human brain and the absence of enabling technologies have hither-to made it impossible to interrogate these interactions brain-wide.

"Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis Project Summary: Brain networks linking the cortex to thalamus are critical for cognitive, sensory, and motor functioning. Dysruption of thalamocortical networks has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including psychosis, and mechanisms of clinical phenotypes, especially cognitive impairment. This view is supported by neuroimaging, including a series of studies by the Co-PIs, which consistently find a combination of reduced thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sensorimotor-thalamic hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While significant progress has been made, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the normal developmental trajectory of thalamocortical networks and onset of connectivity disturbances in psychosis; relationship between cognitive functions supported by thalamocortical circuits and thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers; and clinical utility of imaging thalamocortical networks. The availability of several large-scale cross-sectional datasets containing multi-modal neuroimaging data and extensive phenotypic data on healthy and at-risk individuals has created an unprecedented opportunity to address these critical knowledge gaps. They include the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN: n=656, ages 18-88); Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI- RS: n=932, ages 6-85); Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics dataset (PING: N=1239, ages 3-20); Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC: n=1601, ages 8-21), which includes psychosis spectrum (PS) youth; and the North American Prodromal Longitudinal Study (NAPLS: n=397). Building on our prior work in clinical populations and leveraging the considerable resources of these datasets, we propose to chart the development of thalamocortical networks in healthy subjects (Aim 1) and youth with PS symptoms (Aim 2), characterize the associations between thalamocortical biomarkers and cognition (Aim 3), and investigate the clinical utility of thalamocortical connectivity biomarkers at identifying atypical brain development in individual subjects across the psychosis continuum and predicting conversion to psychosis in clinical high risk individuals (Aim 4). The proposed Aims will: 1) establish critical normative lifespan development data for refining and testing etiological models of not just psychosis, but other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as aging- related disorders; 2) inform the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders and contribute to dimensional models of psychosis; 3) help define the neural basis of executive cognitive abilities thereby providing the necessary foundation for mechanistic models of normal cognitive function and cognitive impairment in psychosis; and 4) potentially provide risk biomarkers and intervention targets for youth at risk for developing a psychotic disorder. Public Health Relevance: Many psychiatric disorders emerge between childhood and early adulthood, a period when the brain is undergoing significant developmental changes, and are associated with cognitive impairment which leads to lifelong limitations in psychosocial functioning. Determining how and when premorbid brain development goes awry, clarifying the neural basis of cognitive impairment, and establishing the clinical utility of brain-based biomarkers at predicting illness onset in individuals at high risk for neuropsychiatric illness are essential to developing targeted interventions that prevent the onset of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.",Development of Thalamocortical Circuits and Cognitive Function in Healthy Individuals and Youth At-Risk for Psychosis,9893033,R01MH115000,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'symptomatology', 'young adult']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,392508,-0.00956132461036998
"Stress-Induced Hormonal Fluctuations and their Relation to Seizure Dynamics in Children with Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the new era of personalized medicine, the epilepsy field is at a tipping point to leverage emerging therapies that can being tailored to individual patient characteristics. Over 30% of children with epilepsy suffer from seizures that cannot be managed by mono- or poly-pharmacotherapies. Targeted neurostimulation and drug delivery are promising alternative therapies but, given the complexity and heterogeneity of the disorder, these therapies need to be precisely guided by the patient’s seizure dynamics. Despite decades of basic and clinical research, the latter remain elusive. In particular, seizure evolution from ictogenesis to ictal onset is poorly understood, in part due to a lack of fundamental understanding of how seizure precipitants impact the brain’s neurophysiological equilibrium, trigger ictogenesis and lead to cumulative changes that facilitate ictal onset. Although the underlying mechanisms of action of common precipitants such as stress and sleep loss are unclear, there is substantial evidence that they may modulate various hormones and neurotransmitters that impact the brain’s excitability and/or balance between excitation and inhibition. This project aims to systematically investigate the impact of large-scale hormonal fluctuations in pediatric epilepsy patients on brain dynamics, and quantify localized and distributed (network-level) electrophysiological changes during seizure evolution. Specifically, in a cohort of n = 40 patients with focal epilepsy who are undergoing continuous noninvasive neurophysiological monitoring as part of their presurgical evaluation, salivary cortisol and catecholamines will be measured 8 times daily, across all study days (Aim 1). Continuous scalp electroncephalograms (EEG) collected during this period will be analyzed in their entirety at the signal and network levels (Aim 2). Pathological high-frequency oscillations, a promising precursor of seizure activity in the epileptic brain will be estimated and classified across the entire period of recording. Multiscale brain networks and their topological properties will be quantified across all dominant frequencies of continuous EEG signals, and their time-dependent seizure sensitivity and specificity will be assessed. Statistical models will be developed to evaluate the relation between each patient-specific circadian hormone rhythms and corresponding temporal patterns of estimated electrophysiological measures, individually and combined into a seizure risk score (Aim 3). This is a first of its kind study that may significantly improve the field’s understanding of the direct and indirect (through hormonal modulations) impact of seizure precipitants, such as stress, on seizure dynamics from ictogenesis to ictal onset. This new knowledge may have a significant impact on the development of next-generation therapies that need to be guided by patient-specific seizure dynamics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through repeated hormone measurements and continuous electrophysiological (scalp EEG data), this project aims to systematically investigate the impact of (predominantly stress-related) hormonal fluctuations on the pediatric epileptic brain and their relationships to seizure evolution, from ictogenesis to ictal onset. The overarching goal of the study is to improve the field’s fundamental understanding of mechanisms underlying electrophysiological changes in the epileptic brain that favor seizure generation. In turn, this knowledge may have a transformative impact on promising next- generation individualized therapies for patients with medically refractory epilepsy.",Stress-Induced Hormonal Fluctuations and their Relation to Seizure Dynamics in Children with Epilepsy,10105451,R03NS119799,"['Alternative Therapies', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Catecholamines', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epinephrine', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hormonal', 'Hormonal Change', 'Hormones', 'Hour', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impact Seizures', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Menstruation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Polynomial Models', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Salivary', 'Salvelinus', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'childhood epilepsy', 'circadian', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'curve fitting', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning network', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'signal processing', 'targeted treatment', 'time use']",NINDS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2020,177000,-0.008991980941699255
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, and involves a complicated interplay between functional infor- mation interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. functional and structural measures. However, the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities misses a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimen- sional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we devel- oped advanced approaches to capture high-dimensional relationships among 2 or more modalities. Our work continues to strongly support the benefits of multimodal data fusion to both provide a more complete picture of brain function and structure, but also to improve our ability to study and predict the impact of complex mental illness. In this new phase of the project, we will focus on methods that can fill some existing gaps, such as the ability to bridge spatial/temporal as well as structural/functional connectivity scales. We also propose a novel framework to integrate unimodal and multimodal features called chromatic fusion, which searches for combina- tions of multimodal `notes' which occupy a unique position in a latent (or dictionary) space. The proposed meth- ods will be validated using simulations, hybrid-data, and large N normative imaging data. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly tested using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symp- toms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression). We will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via GitHub and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 37 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and our work has clearly shown the substantial benefits of ex- tracting multimodal features estimated jointly from the data. In this renewal, we focus on some key understudied areas including fusing across vast spatiotemporal and functional/structural connectivity scales as well as devel- oping powerful new frameworks for integrating the resulting information to enable decision making and enable identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. Completion of our aims will result in a powerful new toolkit for data fusion of multimodal brain imaging data. 36",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,10058554,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data fusion', 'data reduction', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'white matter']",NIBIB,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,542808,0.03980869593615219
"Integrating neuroimaging and brain gene expression for functional characterization of psychiatric GWAS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mental disorders are complex, debilitating health conditions, yet the neurobiological causes and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these disorders are not well understood. The emergence of large- scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has enabled identification of significant, reliable genetic associations to mental disorders. However, it has been difficult to translate GWAS loci into specific causal driver variants/genes to extract mechanistic insights for identifying actionable targets for therapeutic interventions. Neurobiological intermediate phenotypes (NBIPs) are invaluable in understanding the brain’s structural and functional correlates of elevated risk of psychopathology, although the underlying processes and molecular mechanisms for observed NBIPs are elusive. Recent advances in genetic-based imputation now allow one to infer genetically-regulated portions of intermediate phenotypes from genome-wide genotype data. Our research team has successfully employed brain-specific transcriptomic imputation approaches across mental disorders to identify novel genes and pathways of risk. In this proposal, we seek to increase the biological resolution of the link between neuroimaging genetics and psychiatric genetics by creating novel polygenic models of multimodal neuroimaging based on brain-specific gene expression that can be applied to psychiatric GWAS. In Aim 1, we will generate brain transcriptomic predictive models of multimodal neuroimaging and replicate them in independent datasets. In Aim 2, we will conduct Imaging Transcriptome-wide Association Studies (ITWAS) to identify neuroimaging associations with mental disorders at a brain-specific gene-level and distinguish the causal ones. Our integrative analyses will enhance our understanding of NBIPs and mental disorder risk; thus, they will provide mechanistic insights that may drive identification of novel diagnostic, trans-diagnostic and treatment approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mental disorders have substantial morbidity and mortality, contributing to devastating emotional, social and financial tolls on sufferers and their families. We will study the genetic risk architecture of mental disorders, with a focus on the expressed portion of the human genome and imaging of the brain.

"Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY  Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect over five million Americans. Alzheimer's disease begins with changes in the brain more than a decade before the disease can be diagnosed from memory and cognitive impairment in a clinic. The goal of this work is to provide a way to measure early signs of neurodegeneration in individual people. The historical barrier to measure change in individuals is that each person's brain is different with change accumulating too slowly to be picked over short intervals. As a result, most research focuses on tracking averaged subject groups or tracking change over multiple years. The present work optimizes new brain imaging techniques using MRI to make extremely fast, highly precise repeated measurements of brain regions all within the same individual. The work then seeks to use the novel imaging approach to measure neurodegeneration in individuals with early stages of Alzheimer's disease in six months or less and also differentiate changes in people with Alzheimer's disease from less common forms of dementia that have distinct anatomical changes in the brain. If successful, the present work will provide a new means to track the early stages of neurodegeneration as would be used in clinical trials and translational medical research. NARRATIVE  The proposed research explores the possibility of precisely estimating change in specific brain structures in individuals at early stages of neurodegeneration. Anchoring from recent developments in fast brain scanning techniques, we use a novel methodological approach that permits a tremendous increase in the precision of measuring change within a single person by repeatedly, safety, and efficiently scanning the brain over time. Demonstrating successful precision measurement within the individual will open opportunities to track therapeutic effects in small samples during early phases of development as well as allow for individualized estimates of neurodegeneration to be made dynamically within the same person. !",Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals,9971052,R01AG067420,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Procedures', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Unmarried person', 'Variant', 'Work', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive change', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'rate of change', 'safety testing', 'secondary analysis', 'tau Proteins', 'therapeutic development', 'time interval', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIA,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,533173,-0.021170786305065616
"High throughput assaying of circuit activity and connectivity in brain organoids Experimental models of the human developing brain are needed to investigate human-specific aspects of brain development, evolution, and neurological disease. Progress in the field has been hampered by the lack of models, considering that the endogenous developing human brain cannot be directly investigated; animal models often fail to recapitulate human disorders and cannot feasibly be used to study complex polygenic states spanning many genes. While reductionist in nature, stem-cell derived 3D human brain organoids offer a first-of- its-kind opportunity to study processes of human brain formation and wiring that are otherwise not accessible. However, there is an unmet need for organoid models that are cellularly complete and reproducible and for methodology to decode the establishment, connectivity and dynamics of neural circuits in organoids, at scale and with high fidelity. If we could map the activity and connectivity of organoids at scale, both to understand circuit function/dysfunction and to guide further development of organoids, we could close the loop on organoid design and application. Towards this goal, we have developed many molecular and imaging tools for high-throughput analysis of neural activity and connectivity, which we propose to apply to new, next-generation organoid models. Here, we propose a collaborative approach among four groups (Arlotta - brain organoids and human brain development; Boyden - circuit physiology and neural imaging technology; Lewis - material science and bioengineering and Insoo Hyun- bioethics) to pioneer a robust organoid system that combines the development of vascularized brain organoids incorporating more complete cell diversity and maturation with advanced high-throughput functional molecular and imaging tools to enable interrogation of circuit activity, connectivity, and molecular changes in cells participating in physiologically relevant circuits. We will build on a highly reproducible brain organoid model that we recently developed to promote the generation of cell types that are currently absent in organoids but needed for circuit maturation, refinement, and functionality. This work is intended to generate more advanced organoid models designed to promote maturation and robust network activity. In parallel, we will develop a pipeline to record neural activity from intact organoids using all- optical-electrophysiology techniques at scale, and optimize epitope-based barcoding and expansion microscopy to enable molecularly-annotated connectomics of brain organoids. The work proposed here will enable the use of human organoid models to study human circuit formation, plasticity, and function, analyses that are currently hampered by the lack of technologies and assays for high-throughput measurements of circuit physiology and connectivity in organoids. Beyond the work proposed here, these methods will directly enable investigation into how disease states alter information processing in the brain; for example, linking mutations in disease-associated genes with specific abnormalities in human neurons and circuits to inform the identification of molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative  Neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders affect millions worldwide and are of enormous public health significance; however, we have a very limited understanding of the molecular, cellular and circuit-level abnormalities underlying these diseases. Progress in the field has been hampered by the lack of research models, given that animal models often fail to recapitulate the human disease, and that, while 3D human brain organoids offer experimental access to processes of human brain formation and wiring, methodology is needed to decode circuit function and connectivity in organoids, at scale and with high fidelity. We propose here to pioneer the development of next-generation, vascularized brain organoids and to apply novel, scalable molecular and imaging tools to enable investigation of human neural circuits in health and disease.",High throughput assaying of circuit activity and connectivity in brain organoids,10049677,RF1MH123977,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bar Codes', 'Bioethics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epitopes', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Optics', 'Organoids', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cell type', 'collaborative approach', 'design', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'information processing', 'materials science', 'model design', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular scale', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'myelination', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cells', 'synaptic pruning']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,2509021,0.002941087182121362
"Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma Project Summary Childhood trauma dramatically increases the risk of adult psychiatric illness and significantly alters symptom complexity and treatment outcomes. Discovering causal factors and novel interventions could have a dramatic impact on treating psychiatric illness. Over the past decade, there has been a growing appreciation for the role of the gut microbiota in normal brain development and behavior and of critical modulatory effects of the gut microbiota on mental health. Interactions of microbiota with stress-related hormonal, immune, and inflammatory processes in the brain are particularly well supported. Thus, there is intense interest in understanding how interactions among stress, microbiome, and brain (the “stress-biome-brain” axis; SBB) contribute to a significant impact on mental health. We will address the hypothesis that adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. First, we will characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics in mice following recurrent trauma. Mice exposed to recurrent predation stress or to control conditions will be assessed for changes in the gut microbiota, hippocampal gene expression, and behavior. We will use these data to construct multi-level models and predict causal interactions among stress, microbiome, brain, and behavior. Next, we will test the hypothesis that changes in the gut microbiota induced by childhood trauma have causal effects in the brain. We will perform fecal transplants from trauma-exposed mice into naïve mice and measure changes in brain gene expression. These experiments will be performed in a germ-free mouse facility in mice with a small specified number of species, for precise control of microbial content. In addition, we will test strategies for perturbation of the microbial community and to assess behavioral outcomes in the germ-free facility. The data generated will set the stage for precision perturbation studies of the microbiota and its effects on behavior and for future translational studies. Project Narrative Adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome may contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. We will conduct experiments designed to characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics using state of the art genomics and systems biology. The results will provide a ranked list of the factors predicted to drive neuronal and behavioral responses across the system and will form the framework to test their causality.",Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma,9936242,R21MH118597,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early-life trauma', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predatory Behavior', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Trauma', 'Trauma recovery', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'comparative', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fecal transplantation', 'genome sciences', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'multilevel analysis', 'network models', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'synergism', 'translational study', 'trauma exposure', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2020,192828,-0.01654448420752565
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9994891,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multi-task learning', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,448068,-0.010297632989593413
"Mapping human brain perivascular space in lifespan using human connectome project data PROJECT SUMMARY Perivascular spaces are a critical component of the glia-lymphatic circuit, facilitating the clearance of soluble waste. The role of perivascular spaces and changes in the brain’s clearance system in normal development, aging, and cognition is not fully understood, mainly due to lack of neuroimaging capabilities. However, noninvasive in vivo mapping of the perivascular space fluid with high accuracy and reliability is now made possible with our recent analytical developments, using human connectome project (HCP) data. The objective of this project is to map structural and diffusion features of perivascular space fluid across lifespan. PVS features include PVS presence (e.g., count and volume fraction) and diffusion (e.g., diffusivity and anisotropy). These features will be extracted regionally and globally across the brain. Structural MRI will provide information regarding localization and extent of the PVS and diffusion MRI will be used to investigate biophysical properties of the PVS fluid and surrounding tissue. The central hypothesis is that the perivascular space fluid increases across lifespan. We also hypothesize that individual differences exist in perivascular spaces as a function of demographic, general health and lifestyle health choices, such as body mass index, blood pressure, tobacco use and sleep quality. The central hypothesis will be tested by characterizing the normative map of the perivascular space fluid across the lifespan and in relation to various demographic, cognitive measures, and health factors. We will also examine whether subjects neuro-behavioral performances can be predicted by perivascular space features. We will pursue these aims by applying innovative MRI-based computational techniques that we recently developed and optimized on HCP data. We will also use Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Studies to build first normative template of PVS in neurodevelopment. Together, our findings will ultimately allow for a better understanding of the human brain clearance system, and our shared perivascular space mapping workflow can provide a resource for researchers to study a wide range of neurological conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is expected to fill our gap knowledge regarding the role of the clearance system in brain health and cognition and its neuroimaging signature. We will identify and provide access to quantitative morphological and diffusion features of brain glia-lymphatic network to the larger scientific community to help facilitate our understanding of what role the brain clearance system has across lifespan.

"Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue Project Summary / Abstract  Central nervous system infections with RNA viruses cause severe neurological deficits and death, and are extremely challenging to diagnose. This multiple PI proposal presents an innovative research program that will provide the foundation for a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline to rapidly diagnose RNA virus infections from surgical brain biopsies. The investigators will combine two cutting-edge techniques for viral detection, screening with double-stranded RNA immunohistochemistry (dsRNA IHC) to identify cases with a high likelihood of a viral etiology, and unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for specific virus identification and genome analysis.  To develop the dsRNA IHC screening assay, six commercially available anti-dsRNA antibodies will be optimized in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissue and evaluated in a series of known infectious and non-infectious cases. The top candidates will be tested in a set of brain biopsies with inflammation of unclear etiology and compared to results of mNGS performed in parallel. The development of this assay will facilitate efficient screening of FFPE tissue samples from patients with neurological disease of unclear pathogenesis to identify those with a high likelihood of viral etiology. To improve mNGS methods for FFPE brain tissue, new laboratory techniques will be tested to increase the yield and quality of viral RNA extracted. In addition to virus identification, mNGS will be used to perform full-genome deep sequencing of viruses. These results can be applied to molecular epidemiology, disease surveillance, and understanding pathogen-host interactions. Overall, this project will enhance our understanding of RNA viruses that cause CNS infection, inform future studies of virus evolution and pathogenesis, and lay the foundation for the development of a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline that will substantially improve the care of patients with devastating CNS infections. This work aligns very well with the NINDS mission to seek and apply fundamental knowledge of the brain to reduce the burden of neurological disease.  This R21 Exploratory Neuroscience Research Grant proposal will support and expand the collaboration between the two PIs. The unique combination of expertise in neuropathology, infectious disease pathology, virology, clinical infectious disease, and metagenomic sequencing demonstrate the requisite skills and perspective needed to achieve the goals of this proposal. The stimulating environments of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard University, and Emory University are extremely well suited to the proposed research plan, which not only provide critical equipment and facilities infrastructure, but also mentorship, formal opportunities to present and discuss results, and eventual venues to implement this clinical testing prospectively. Project Narrative Viral infections of the central nervous system cause significant illness and death, and in many patients the specific virus causing infection is never found. This project will develop new tools to detect viruses in brain tissue, including previously unknown viruses, and sequence their genomes. The objectives of this project are to improve diagnostics for patients with devastating neurological illness, and to open new research directions in studying viruses that cause central nervous system infection.",Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue,10105533,R21NS119660,"['Adenoviruses', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Arboviruses', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Central Nervous System Viral Diseases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cytoplasmic Inclusion', 'DNA Viruses', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Double-Stranded RNA', 'Encephalitis', 'Enterovirus', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Herpesviridae', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Target', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Nodule', 'Nuclear Inclusion', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Virus Infections', 'RNA Viruses', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Shotgun Sequencing', 'Specimen', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'deep sequencing', 'fungus', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'innovation', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropathology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'prospective test', 'rRNA Genes', 'rapid diagnosis', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'viral RNA', 'viral detection', 'viral genomics', 'virology', 'virus identification', 'whole genome']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,480375,-0.006122110387954861
"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology). The findings will yield novel classification approaches for negative symptom severity, may identify novel treatment targets (circuitry), and may yield classifications to stratify patients to treatment conditions.",ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits,9988505,R01MH121246,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Aphasia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Face', 'Factor Analysis', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Informatics', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychopathology', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Social Processes', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'computational platform', 'dimensional analysis', 'disability', 'druggable target', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient stratification', 'pleasure', 'quality assurance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'social', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'working group']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,932115,0.004232677838937187
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center Project Summary/Abstract In its initial funding period, the ABCD consortium used a rigorous epidemiological approach to recruit a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10-year-olds through our 21 research sites, of which 2136 are twins or triplets. ABCD has created a comprehensive yet efficient protocol for participating youth and parents, using standardized and state-of-the-art methods for neuroimaging, biospecimens, and assessments of substance use, mental and physical health, neurocognition, culture, and environment, using a fully digital platform and making use of mobile technologies. We ensure cohesion and standardization by having employed a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC), which will: maintain and update the harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; perform rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay- derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state-of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; continue development of infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows; and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ABCD Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,878 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC) will maintain and update harmonized MRI protocols across sites and scanners, perform quality control of raw and derived data, and implement the informatics and computational infrastructure needed for the overall project.","ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center",9981957,U24DA041123,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caffeine', 'Calibration', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nicotine', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Social Functioning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Update', 'Youth', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'data archive', 'data dissemination', 'data exploration', 'data quality', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'handheld mobile device', 'health assessment', 'high standard', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'infrastructure development', 'mobile computing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'physical conditioning', 'recruit', 'retention rate', 'success', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'web portal']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2020,1020000,0.03327289594161995
"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9897563,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'adult obesity', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'immunoregulation', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'professional atmosphere', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2020,202864,0.033671486339016767
