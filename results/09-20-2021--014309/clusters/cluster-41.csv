"Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors Project Summary/Abstract One of the key advances in modern positron emission tomography (PET) systems for clinical imaging is the use of time-of-flight (TOF) information. In cancer imaging TOF provides superior lesion detection and more accurate quantification that is crucial in measuring response to therapy, as well as in neurological and cardiovascular imaging applications. An additional benefit of TOF is the ability to lower the radiation dose or scan time without sacrificing image quality, important for patient safety and comfort. The magnitude of these clinical benefits is determined by the TOF resolution of the PET detectors, therefore the prospect of achieving unprecedented image quality and clinical imaging capabilities with superior TOF resolution has fueled significant research in developing detector technology for TOF-PET systems. However, these developments have been largely unaccompanied by advances in signal processing methods needed to extract TOF information from the detector’s electrical signals, with most detectors making use of crude analog algorithms that discard most of the useful timing information contained in the signals. Now, with the availability of low-cost fast waveform digitizers, there is an exciting opportunity to implement sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to achieve superior TOF resolution. The main advantage of developing advanced signal processing algorithms is that it presents a cost-effective route to improved TOF resolution that is complementary to instrumentation innovations. In essence, the TOF gain comes for free; the detector signals already contain the information needed for better TOF resolution, it just needs to be used effectively. Here we propose to tailor deep learning techniques to estimate TOF from the detector signals. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a powerful approach to learn complex representations of input data that can be used for tasks such as classification and regression. CNNs are therefore very suitable for directly estimating TOF from the detector waveforms, since these waveforms are influenced by several complex and intertwined processes which are hard to accurately model. Furthermore, large amounts of ground truth training data are readily generated. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of CNN-based TOF estimation, and found up to 23% improvement in TOF resolution compared to standard signal processing methods. This proposal aims to optimize these methods to push the limits of achievable TOF resolution and develop methods for their practical implementation. First, we will develop CNN architectures and methods suitable for silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) that are now used in modern TOF-PET systems. We will also optimize the digitizing parameters to make optimal use of CNNs for TOF estimation. Second, we will implement CNN-TOF methods in a modern commercial PET detector, including using a global CNN to simultaneously estimate TOF and the crystal-of-interaction from the detector waveforms, demonstrating the practical feasibility of using this promising deep learning method in next generation PET systems. Narrative The use of time-of-flight information in positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful way to increase clinical imaging capabilities of PET, and is now used in most modern systems. Improving time-of-flight performance promises to provide substantial benefits for lesion detection in cancer imaging, kinetic modeling with dynamic imaging, and the use of lower radiation dose for patient safety. Here we introduce deep learning signal processing methods to significantly improve the performance of time-of-flight PET detectors without requiring new materials, which thereby represents a cost effective route towards maximizing the use of the rich imaging signal provided by time-of-flight.",Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors,9784818,R03EB027268,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Electronics', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'analog', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'neural network architecture', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'photomultiplier', 'physical process', 'response', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'time use', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2019,78500,0.03046571995645553
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning,9789276,R01EB025220,"['Acetazolamide', 'Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'ImProv', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Japanese Population', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Premenopause', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Spin Labels', 'Stress Tests', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Waste Products', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Xenon', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'cerebrovascular imaging', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'design', 'direct application', 'disability', 'evidence based guidelines', 'gender difference', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'men', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'response', 'stressor', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'time use', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,586260,-0.0017418485188090132
"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9783816,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,438449,0.04404191759902534
"Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography (PET) is a high-sensitivity molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, with the ability to observe molecular-level activities inside a living body through the injection of specific radioactive tracers. In addition to the commonly used F-18-FDG, new tracers are being constantly developed and investigated to pinpoint specific pathways in various diseases. New PET scanners are also being proposed by exploiting time of flight (TOF) information, enabling depth of interaction capability, and extending the solid angle coverage. To realize the full potential of the new PET tracers and scanners, there is an increasing need for the development of advanced image reconstruction methods. This grant application proposes a new framework for regularized image reconstruction that synergistically integrates deep learning and regularized image reconstruction. The new framework is enabled by the recent advances in machine learning, which provide a tool to digest vast amount information embedded in existing medical images. The proposed method embeds a pre-trained deep neural network in an iterative image reconstruction framework and uses the deep neural network to regularize PET image directly. By training the deep neural network with a large amount of high-quality low-noise PET images, the proposed method can capture complex prior information from existing inter-subject and intra-subject data and thus is expected to substantially outperform the current state-of-the-art regularized image reconstruction method. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop the theoretical framework to synergistically integrate deep learning in regularized image reconstruction for PET and (2) to implement the proposed method and validate its effectiveness using existing animal data. Once the proposed method is validated using existing animal data, we will seek funding to acquire necessary human data for the implementation of the proposed method on clinical PET scanners. Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique widely used in clinic for detecting cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. This project will develop an innovative image reconstruction method that has potential to improve PET image quality and reduce radiation dose. Its success will improve the accuracy of PET for cancer detection and other diseases.",Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography,9752639,R21EB026668,"['Advanced Development', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radioactive Tracers', 'Rattus', 'Role', 'Solid', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'animal data', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2019,196250,0.017703685585517104
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,9653979,R01CA218187,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,663746,-0.02183236915541039
"Machine Learning in Breast Parenchyma and Tumor Characterization for Cancer Risk Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY We propose a study of radiomic texture analysis in terms of robustness assessment and classification utility. We will introduce novel robustness metrics geared towards assessment of radiomic features in comparison across two image conditions, and apply these metrics to study feature robustness across imaging parameters and patient biology. In addressing the utility of radiomic features in cancer risk assessment, we will identify and evaluate texture signatures from mammography and tomosynthesis datasets. The field of radiomics is evolving fast, and quantitative texture analysis is being applied to a growing number of applications in medical imaging. By performing a thorough investigation of the robustness of these radiomic features to dataset heterogeneities we aim to identify the strengths and weaknesses of commonly used features to guide their implementations on future applications.  Two clinical tasks will be studied under the proposed research: 1) risk assessment and cancer prediction and 2) malignancy evaluation. Multiple modalities including tomosynthesis, mammography and MRI will be involved in studies geared towards addressing these clinical questions. An evaluation of the robustness of commonly employed radiomic features will help guide the field of medical texture analysis and contribute to meaningful conclusions in future studies throughout the field of quantitative image analysis. The first aim of the proposed research involves the proposition and evaluation of novel robustness metrics for investigations lacking a classification task. The second aim will extend the study of radiomics to investigate the utility of robust features in classification tasks and identification of texture signatures relate to biomedical characteristics. The third aim will build upon the two previous aims and culminate in the application of cutting-edge technologies in machine learning and deep learning in further promoting image processing in the field of medical physics. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate and improve the application of radiomic texture features in cancer risk assessment. We will accomplish this by evaluating the robustness of various radiomic metrics, testing the classification utility of texture features in clinical tasks, and extending current classification methods to include cutting-edge developments in machine learning technology. Careful preliminary studies have demonstrated methods for selection of robust texture features and improvement in classification tasks by emphasizing feature robustness in feature selection methodology and we therefore believe that a meticulous evaluation of the impact of imaging parameters on feature calculations will lead to overall improvement of computer-aided diagnosis and clinical translation to progress in cancer screening protocols.",Machine Learning in Breast Parenchyma and Tumor Characterization for Cancer Risk Assessment,9683697,F31CA228247,"['Address', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impact evaluation', 'Incidence', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'expectation', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular subtypes', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'response', 'tomosynthesis', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2019,24304,-0.01382209371980357
"Generalizing Deep Learning Reconstruction for Free-Breathing and Quantitative MRI Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to increase the precision and resolution of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Quantitative information such as tissue relaxation parameters (e.g., T1 and T2) measure tissue function and indicate disease-related changes in the heart, liver, brain, and other organs. For instance, T1 changes can provide evidence of diffuse fibrosis in the myocardium that can signal heart disease. Quantitative maps also are reproducible, directly comparable longitudinally and across subjects, and less affected by the properties of the scanner used, when compared versus common weighted (non-quantitative) clinical imaging. But, quantitative imaging involves more complicated and time-consuming pulse sequences. To accomplish this goal, this project will develop new machine learning algorithms for high-quality parameter mapping from free-breathing data. The first aim of this project will increase parameter map resolution achievable from highly accelerated, noisy data. The proposed method will integrate existing deep cascade network-based image reconstructions with convolutional network-based blocks for super-resolution and parameter map estimation. Preliminary studies suggest these new blocks improve sharpness and mitigate artifacts in the reconstructed parameter maps. The next aim will improve the training precision of such artificial neural networks to account for the significant per-voxel nonlinear fit variability in quantitative MRI. The proposed method will reweight the loss function used for calibrating these networks by the goodness-of-fit (coefficient of determination) of the reference maps obtained from fully sampled training data. Preliminary results demonstrate that quality-aware reweighting significantly improves reconstructed image quality when working with noisy training data. Experiments will evaluate the precision of both of these innovations against existing deep-learning-based reconstructions on T1 maps obtained from pre- and post-contrast cardiac images of volunteer patients. The final aim will address motion during the acquisition by estimating and tracking nonrigid motion in the data consistency stages of the deep cascade artificial neural network architecture. Two methods are proposed: deformable motion estimation already demonstrated on compressive model-based image reconstructions, and a new “re-blurring” convolutional neural network that automatically introduces artifacts into a “clean” image to match the motion-corrupted data. Both of these methods enforce consistency between motion-affected data and a motion-free image during the reconstruction. Both methods will be validated on both cardiac and abdominal images for motion artifacts and reconstruction quality against breath-held parameter mapping acquisitions. Project Narrative Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging noninvasively measures physical properties of tissue connected to cardiovascular disease and many other conditions. Novel machine learning methods for processing data to produce higher quality maps will facilitate earlier and more accurate treatment of these diseases.

"Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning Project Summary Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in approximately a third of all MRI scans. The unique relaxation parameters of GBCAs create indispensable image contrast for a wide range of clinical applications, such as angiography and tumor detection. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF can be painful, cause severe disability, and even death. The risk of developing NSF prevents millions of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams. The recent identification of gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised additional safety concerns about the usage of GBCAs. Studies have demonstrated increased signal intensity on the unenhanced T1-weighted MR images that is correlated with previous GBCA exposure, and this gadolinium retention is independent of renal function. While initial reports focused on linear GBCAs, more recent reports show that gadolinium deposition occurs with macrocyclic GBCAs as well, albeit at lower levels. FDA has recently issued warnings about gadolinium retention following contrast-enhanced MRI, and required GBCA manufacturers to conduct human and animal studies to further assess the safety of these contrast agents. This project addresses these concerns by developing low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL). Approach: This fast-track project has two phases and three aims. Aim 1 (Phase I) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using pre-contrast images and contrast-enhanced images acquired with only 10% of standard GBCA dose. A software infrastructure will be constructed to seamlessly integrate the DL software between MR scanners and PACS. Aim 2 (Phase II) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using GBCA-free acquisitions with different image contrast. In Aim 3 (Phase II), we will clinically validate and evaluate both low-dose and zero-dose DL methods, including on patients with mild- to-moderate CKD. Non-inferiority tests and diagnostic performance of the synthesized full-dose images compared to the true full-dose images will be performed. Significance: This work will lead to safer contrast-enhanced MRI. The low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI method will benefit not only millions of patients with advanced CKD, who cannot currently undergo contrast-enhanced MRI, but many more patients with normal kidney function, who are at the risk of gadolinium retention after contrast-enhanced MRI. Project Narrative Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in MRI exams to create indispensable image contrast for monitoring treatment and investigating pathology and function. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, preventing patients with advanced chronic kidney disease from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams, as well as potential gadolinium deposition in the body and brain for patients with normal kidney function.

This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9746373,R21EB026665,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Central cord canal structure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiculopathy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'theories', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment optimization', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,234000,0.008790798854689464
"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9766063,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,676760,0.009762189878620254
"Automatic Volumetric Treatment Response Assessment and Determination of Regional Genetic Characteristics in Glioblastoma Project Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary adult brain tumor with an incidence rate of 3.2 per 100,000 people. Due to its heterogeneous genetic characteristics, GBM carries a dismal prognosis, with a median survival of only 14 months and five-year survival rates are less than 10%. The current standard of care is maximal safe surgical resection, chemoradiation, and adjuvant temozolomide. Within the natural history of GBM, there are adaptive genetic changes within the tumor that lead to treatment resistance and inevitable recurrence, leading to patient death. While a variety of treatments can be administered for tumor recurrence, there is currently no consensus on therapy for recurrent tumor as none have been proven to provide substantial survival benefit. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment. Rather, clinical decision-making is based on a manual and variable two- dimensional measure of tumor burden, a surrogate of tumor volume, and genetic characterization of select molecular markers at the time of initial surgery. A tool that can automatically assess tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics longitudinally will substantially improve evaluation of treatment efficacy, allowing for an earlier switch to alternative treatment strategies and thus, more personalized tailoring of patient care. Thus, a critical need exists for automatic methods that non-invasively evaluate treatment efficacy on a patient-to-patient basis. To address this problem, we will develop a novel solution based on deep learning that leverages structural, diffusion, and perfusion information from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging. At the core of our solution is a convolutional neural network; a machine learning technique that can be trained on raw image data to predict clinical outputs of interest. Firstly, we will develop a fully automatic technique for longitudinal tracking of tumor volumes. To do this, we will develop novel deep learning architectures through incorporation of state-of-the-art neural network components that can segment both whole tumor and tumor subregions (edema, non-enhancing tumor, and gadolinium contrast-enhancing tumor). To prove algorithm utility, we will automatically derive tumor volumes in a longitudinal patient cohort and correlate volumes with clinical outcomes. Secondly, we will develop a non-invasive, deep learning algorithm for evaluation of regional genetic characteristics of GBM. To train this algorithm, we will acquire imaging-localized surgical biopsies and genetic profiling of GBM patients undergoing surgery. Once trained, the algorithm can be used to non- invasively identify clonal populations and track genetic changes associated with clinical outcomes during the course of treatment. The development of these deep learning algorithms will transform physician’s capacity for clinical decision-making and dramatically improve outcomes for a devastating disease. Project Narrative The proposed research will provide automatic deep-learning tools to aid clinical decision-making for glioblastoma, the most common primary adult brain tumor that carries a dismal prognosis. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment.

"Development and Dissemination of KiNet: A Novel Imaging Informatics Tool for Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are one heterogeneous type of cancer affecting most organ systems. NETs must be correctly graded to ensure proper treatment and patient management. The proliferation index, as measured by Ki67 nuclear staining, is required for gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic NET grading per the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Measuring the Ki67 labeling index (Ki67 LI) from pathology images requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. This process is an essential procedure in basic, translational and clinical research and in routine clinical practice. However, current Ki67 image analysis tools have a number of drawbacks: 1) Ki67 LI assessment is still mainly achieved with manual or semi-automated methods, leading to increased labor costs, awkward workflows, low-throughput image analysis and significant potential inter- and intra-observer variability; 2) computer-aided Ki67 counting is error-prone due to the multi-stage image processing design, where each stage itself is a very challenging task; 3) current algorithm design does not take into consideration the characteristics of Ki67 images such that it has technical difficulty in classifying different types of cells in Ki67 stained images. In this proposed research, we seek to develop and disseminate a novel deep learning-based imaging informatics system, KiNeT, specifically for better automated Ki67 LI measurement in GI and pancreatic NETs. KiNet will take advantage of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs), to develop an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel model for single-stage Ki67 LI assessment. To this end, we will first formulate Ki67 counting as a cell identification problem and solve it using class-aware structured regression modeling within a novel FCN network. This network will simultaneously detect and classify immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. Next, we will further enhance cell identification with another related task, extraction of regions of interest (ROIs), which will differentiate tumor from non-tumor regions by taking Ki67 image characteristics into consideration. These two tasks will be unified into one single neural network and jointly learned to benefit both cell identification and region classification. KiNet will provide a novel computational method for accurate Ki67 LI assessment, thereby enabling early detection and targeted treatments of the diseases. Compared to manual counting and current Ki67 image analysis methods, it will significantly improve the objectivity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility and efficiency. Additionally, the proposed single-stage Ki67 counting strategy, which is completely different from current multi-stage Ki67 image analysis pipelines, will provide a new perspective for Ki67 image quantification. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ki67 labeling index (LI) is a reliable and critical biomarker to grade gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). This biomarker computation requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells.

"IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging Project Summary This proposal requests funds to provide travel support for graduates to attend and participate in the IEEE Inter- national Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2019 conference, Venice, Italy on April 08-11, 2019. The main objective of the IEEE ISBI is to bring together researchers with interests in mathematical and computa- tional aspects of biomedical imaging, with a focus on addressing problems of significance to the development and application of imaging systems across spatial scales, from microscopy to whole-body imaging. ISBI partici- pants – on the order of 600-700 from across the world are involved in biomedical imaging research and development in academic institutions, government laboratories, or R&D departments of private companies. ISBI is co-sponsored by two IEEE societies: Signal Processing Society (SPS) and Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS), representing academia, industry, and healthcare, and considered the world's foremost societies in biomedical engineering and imaging. SPS and EMBS publish IEEE Transactions on Medical Imag- ing, Transactions on Image Processing, Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, Transactions on Computational Imaging, and IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, among others. Since incep- tion in 2002, ISBI has become the leading international conference bringing together researchers from diverse algorithmic fields, applications, modalities, and size scales, to facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas across imag- ing modalities and scales. Conference topics include physical, biological and statistical modeling, image formation and reconstruction, computational and statistical image analysis, visualization and image quality as- sessment, and artificial intelligence and machine learning for big image data. ISBI, like other IEEE SPS and EMBS conferences, requires submission and review of a 4-page paper. Peer reviews are handled by a 50-mem- ber editorial board (area editors) of leading experts in the community, who in turn assign papers to well- qualified reviewers. All oral and poster papers are published in IEEExplore as Proceedings of ISBI. If awarded, IEEE anticipates the primary impact of this R13 grant will be increased attendance of U.S.-based students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty. By offering to cover a significant portion of attendee's travel expenses, the cost-benefit ratio for attending ISBI 2019 will be extremely favorable. Furthermore, IEEE will award travel grants based on need and scientific excellence, creating opportunities for those early career researchers who have accepted papers (of which less than 50% are accepted to ISBI) and who have limited means to travel. IEEE will be particularly supportive in providing travel awards to women, under-represented groups, and persons with disabilities. Benefits can largely be summarized as “exposure” and education. ISBI provides opportunity for student exposure to many more areas of computational imaging research than generally available in her/his home institution, and concurrently provides opportunity for students to interact with leaders in the field through tutorials, plenary, oral, and poster presentations, and individual discussions.

"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.!",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,9669002,R61AR073552,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2019,447173,0.038387933346502014
"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality.

"Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials Project Summary / Abstract In patients with lymphomas and other cancers, quantitative evaluation of the extent of tumor burden is im- portant for staging, restaging, and assessment of therapeutic response or relapse; yet measurement of overall tumor burden is challenging with current tools, particularly when lymph nodes are confluent or difficult to fully differentiate from surrounding structures. Precision medicine and novel therapeutics are emphasizing the need to introduce a risk-adapted approach to tailor appropriate treatment strategies for cancer patients. The ability to quantitatively assess cancer phenotypes with functional and anatomical imaging that could efficiently and ac- curately map patients to gene expression profiling, clinical information, matching cohorts, and novel treatment regimens could potentially result in more optimal management of patients with cancer.  This Academic-Industry Partnership aims to translate recently developed technologies for semi- automated image segmentation and quantification of lymph nodes into robust tools and integrate them into an existing cloud-based system for management of multicenter oncology clinical trials. The ability to semi- automatically segment lymph node pathology with computed tomography (CT), as well as quantify nodal me- tabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) will enable comprehensive tracking of morphological and functional changes related to disease progression and treatment response.  Since 2004, the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center's (DF/HCC) Tumor Imaging Metrics Core (TIMC) has developed the Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC (PIM) platform to manage clinical trial image assessment workflows. Currently, there are nearly 50,000 consistently measured lymph node measurements in the TIMC database. The PIM system is used to make over 20,000 time point imaging assessments per year at eight NCI- designated Cancer Centers and aims to grow quickly by transitioning to a fully cloud-hosted system.  Given sufficient training data, state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technolo- gies can meet or even exceed human performance on specific imaging analysis tasks. Recent studies have indicated that AI-based lymph node segmentation from CT scans is nearing human performance levels, and we will extend and translate this work into a commercial tool. Specifically, our aim is to translate recent ad- vancements in AI-based segmentation into deployable services, and integrate these services into the clinical trial workflow. The proposed system will be designed to incorporate expert feedback provided by image ana- lysts and radiologists back into the ground truth dataset, allowing for continuous improvement in accuracy and clinical acceptance. We will extend our semi-automatic CT segmentation technologies to quantify lymph node metabolism in PET/CT, using lymphoma as the model disease. Integration of these technologies with PIM will provide an ongoing source of consistently measured quantitative data across a network of cancer centers. Project Narrative Advanced quantitative imaging is underutilized in oncologic clinical practice and research because the time investment entailed in manual lesion segmentation remains prohibitive. This partnership proposes to integrate machine learning based quantitative imaging tools into the existing Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC clinical trial image management system. We will use data from the centralized Tumor Imaging Metrics Core at the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center to produce ground truth training data and develop semi-automated multimodali- ty lesion analysis for patients with cancer.",Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials,9817851,R01CA235589,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Goals', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'NCI-Designated Cancer Center', 'Nodal', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Services', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Burden', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'glucose metabolism', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'lymph nodes', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'success', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,683973,-0.0007158071090522499
"Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response Abstract  The continuing goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective imaging-based strategies to personalize brain tumor treatment. Current Response Assessment in NeuroOncology (RANO) criteria, which incorporate anatomic imaging only, are insufficient for distinguishing tumor from treatment effect (TE). Without definitive confirmation of tumor progression, no treatment changes are recommended for several months after standard therapies. Thus, patients are precluded from switching to potentially more effective therapies—a limitation that could be overcome with more reliable imaging techniques.  To this end, during the previous funding cycle, we demonstrated the feasibility of several quantitative imaging (QI) tools to reliably distinguish tumor from treatment effect and predict treatment response. These QI tools include a machine-learning approach to calibrate T1w images enabling the creation of quantitative delta T1 (qDT1) maps. The qDT1 enable the detection of true contrast enhancing lesion volume (CELV). The qDT1 together with our proven dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI methods, for determination of rCBV (relative cerebral blood volume), are used to generate a new biomarker, fractional tumor burden (FTB), to delineate the extent of tumor within CELV on a voxel-wise basis. These perfusion-based QI tools in combination with our diffusion MRI technology, which includes functional diffusion maps (FDMs) and more recently RSI (restriction spectrum imaging), provide a comprehensive assessment of brain tumor and its distinction from treatment effect.  Now, in order to translate this technology for use in clinical trials and daily practice, some final updates and clinical validation studies are needed as proposed here. First, to ease adoption and testing in the clinical setting improvements are proposed for the individual QI technologies along with the development of a streamlined workflow (Aim 1). To improve the widespread adoption of DSC-MRI and FTB biomarker, studies will be performed to confirm that a single-dose DSC-MRI method can replace the standard double-dose method without affecting the accuracy of rCBV or the creation of FTB maps (Aim 1.1). Also, registration and segmentation algorithms will be updated to include deformable registration and recent advances in deep learning for longitudinal reporting of CELV, non-enhancing lesion volumes (NELV) and each of the QI metrics (Aim 1.2). Finally, a streamlined workflow that incorporates these improvements will be created (Aim 1.3). The Aim 2 studies will test the QI tools and workflow using clinical trial data (Aim 2.1-2.2) and daily clinical practice (Aim 2.3-2.4).  Clinical validation of this new QI-RANO workflow, with evidence showing improved prediction in comparison to current measures, has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how brain tumor burden is assessed. Project Narrative The goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective quantitative imaging (QI)-based strategies to provide earlier indications of brain tumor treatment response than is currently available. The QI tools, which include novel quantitative measures of enhancing lesion (qDT1), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), fractional tumor burden (FTB) and functional diffusion maps (fDM) will be updated and validated in the context of clinical trials. Working in close collaboration with an industrial partner, the proven methods will be translated into a software platform for widespread use within the quantitative imaging network (QIN), and for both clinical trials and daily standard of care.",Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response,9781262,U01CA176110,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Funding', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predisposition', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Update', 'Validation', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cerebral blood volume', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'validation studies']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,U01,2019,584330,0.055211483359498846
"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource.

"Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT In the U.S., more than 600,000 knee osteoarthritis (OA)-related total knee joint replacement (TKR) cases are reported every year, exceeding $17 billion estimated direct costs annually. There is a growing need for disease- modifying therapies that prevent or delay the need for TKR. However, development of such therapies remains challenging due to the lack of objective and measurable OA biomarkers for disease progression. The course of the OA is highly variable between individuals and the OA progresses too slowly, making it difficult to identify sensitive OA biomarkers capable of capturing minor changes on the knee joint. This has slowed development of effective therapies and prevents physicians from providing the most effective advice about minimizing the need for TKR. In this project, our goal is to develop imaging biomarkers to monitor minor OA-related changes in knee joint health that lead to TKR. To achieve this goal, we will combine novel deep learning algorithms with clinical and imaging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The OAI dataset includes clinical data, biospecimens, radiographs, and magnetic resonance (MR) images collected over 8 years. The proposed project has three Specific Aims: (i) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from the bilateral posteroanterior fixed-flexion knee radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); (ii) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from structural and compositional MR images using 3D CNNs with RNNs combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); and (iii) to determine whether deep learning–based imaging biomarkers can act as surrogates to predict the OA progression using a subject cohort (n = 296) independent of the cohort used to identify imaging biomarkers. The proposed project will couple deep learning with diagnostic radiology to unveil key combinations of OA-relevant features directly from images with minimal user interaction. This will facilitate fast individualized assessment of OA progression using whole knee joint images directly. If successful, this study will bring new insights into the development of imaging biomarkers for OA progression and more broadly into our understanding and treatment of OA. The knowledge gained in this project will help to advance close monitoring of OA progression by opening new perspectives on the regions and parameters for potential inclusion in both intervention studies and clinical practice. NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disorder of joints and is the most common reason leading to total knee joint replacement. Our proposed study aims to develop a novel automated OA-relevant imaging biomarker identification system based on radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and deep learning methods to study knee OA progression. We will address whether combining deep learning algorithms with medical images will determine the key combinations of features relevant to knee OA that are required to accurately predict the OA progression outcome.",Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis,9818000,R01AR074453,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'tool']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,489349,0.016283299545927006
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9788239,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,562232,0.000444859548151641
"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,9825278,R21EB027241,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tissue biomarkers', 'white matter']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2019,209851,0.02055960002243953
"31st Annual International MR Angiography Conference Project Summary The objective of the 31st Annual Workshop on Magnetic Resonance Angiography is to provide a forum for scientists and scientist-clinicians, clinical staff and industry interested in MR angiography techniques. The Workshop is the annual meeting of the Society for Magnetic Resonance Angiography (SMRA). At this meeting, emerging techniques and exciting new applications to visualize the vascular system, measure and display blood flow and improve patient outcomes will be presented. MR angiography is an important clinical tool that is applied to millions of patients annually and accounts for an estimated 10% of all MR procedures. Recent advances in time-resolved imaging, non-contrast imaging, post-processing techniques, flow measurements, and flow visualization, as well other innovations, continue to make MRA a dynamic, cutting-edge area of interest for scientific investigation. A major goal of this SMRA Workshop is to provide scientists, clinicians, and students with the opportunity to build connections, pool their knowledge, and educate each other in order to accelerate the refinement of MRA technology and critically how to apply it in clinical practice. Topics for the MRA Workshop will include: vascular disease mechanisms, vessel wall and plaque imaging, quantification of blood flow dynamics, applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning, MRA of the brain, heart, abdomen, and extremities; contrast agents, cardiac MR, assessment of cardiac structure and function, clinical study design, new MRA techniques, MRI of implanted devices, technology assessment, comparing MRI with other imaging modalities and critically translating advanced MRA techniques into day-to- day clinical practice. The 3-day workshop will be preceded by an informative one-day educational program that will include both fundamental and advanced lectures from international experts in the field. These topics and educational objectives of the 31st Annual Workshop on Magnetic Resonance Angiography are directly related to the NHLBI mission to provide global leadership for research, training, and education to promote the prevention and treatment of heart and blood diseases. The scientific presentations will include new discoveries about the causes of disease and as such contribute to the translation of basic discoveries into clinical practice.

"Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors Abstract Solid tumors are comprise the large majority of cancers (>90%). Standard of diagnosis and care often involved serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors. The long-term goal of this project is to provide computation tools for understanding the histopathologic variation of solid tumors and aid the development of image guided therapies for individualizing solid tumor treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging and that they can contribute towards the development of adaptive radiation therapy (ART). Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the development of fast and accurate computational tools for using MR image guided radiation therapy in clinical settings. Project Narrative The proposal aims to advance our current understanding of the association of malignant solid tumors at the cellular level. We plan to develop fast computational tools for real time image guided radiation, personalized to individual variations in cancer patients. Overall, this will help improve cancer diagnosis and treatment by better differentiation between healthy and aggressive cancer tissue, and by improved precision for targeted therapy.",Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors,9771401,R21CA231892,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian learning', 'Brain', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Pathology', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'feature detection', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image guided therapy', 'image-guided radiation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'individual variation', 'individualized medicine', 'learning algorithm', 'member', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel architecture', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive tools', 'real-time images', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2019,194940,0.024970975086506544
"Quantitative Image Modeling for Brain Tumor Analysis and Tracking Project Summary Differentiation of tumor recurrence from radiation-induced necrosis (RN) is a critical step in the follow-up management of patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery for brain tumor. A non-invasive method that is robust in discriminating RN from recurrent tumor using non-invasive method such as MRI is of a significant value for patients and physicians. The hypothesis of this proposed project is that advanced Machine-learning (ML) and image analysis of different MRI imaging information may hold potential for accurately detecting the difference between RN and recurrence of brain tumor is a substantial challenge in the daily practice in Neuro-Oncology. Furthermore, there is a need to study feasibility of translating our ongoing works in brain tumor volume quantitation into potential imaging device. Consequently, this Administrative Supplement propose the following Specific Aims for this study: Aim 1: To develop novel methods to discriminate RN from tumor recurrence in MRI. Aim 2: To develop and prepare a fast track SBIR proposal (Phase I and II combined) to be submitted soon after this Administrative Supplemental funding expires. If successful, robust discrimination of radiation-induced RN and tumor recurrence will make our current brain tumor and abnormal tissue volume segmentation methods and tools more robust and ready for use in the radiology and oncology practices. Furthermore, the planned SBIR project funding will lead the way to fully explore the possibility of launching a commercial software technology for brain tumor volume quantitation imaging device development. Project Narrative For ongoing work in our parent RO1 grant we are developing new machine learning and image analysis methods for automatic detection and segmentation of brain tumor in MRI images, which is expected to help patients to have a much better chance of successful treatment.

"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9762101,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,223680,-0.01567833379277858
"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them. Overall Project Narrative  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) develops novel imaging techniques and technologies for the improved diagnosis and management of cancer, musculoskeletal disease, neurological disease and other disorders with a profound impact on human health. By exploiting connections between imaging modalities such as MRI and PET, we aim to advance the fundamental capabilities of each, so as to expand biomedical knowledge and improve the care of patients.",Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R),9804438,P41EB017183,"['Adopted', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagination', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrial Product', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Philosophy', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Stream', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'bioimaging', 'biophysical model', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel imaging technique', 'off-patent', 'open source', 'operation', 'radio frequency', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'web site']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P41,2019,1715698,0.0371870355669198
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9782996,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,348107,0.020772473631538193
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans.

"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9742524,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'supervised learning', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,659674,0.005521664212073711
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization.

This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits. However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery. This project aims to develop a novel tool based on stimulated Raman microscopy to image fresh brain tissue in a label-free manner, providing comparable histological information to conventional H&E staining, to guide brain tumor resection in real time in the operating room.",Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery,9724467,R00EB020749,"['Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atypia', 'Award', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophotonics', 'Biophysics', 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Density', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Fine-needle biopsy', 'Frequencies', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Frozen Sections', 'Funding', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Skill', 'Linear Algebra', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuronavigation', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Online Systems', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgical Injuries', 'Surgical Oncology', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Step', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor resection', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'chemical bond', 'chemical group', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'computer science', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'fluorescence-guided surgery', 'frontier', 'gray matter', 'human disease', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'meningioma', 'microscopic imaging', 'mouse model', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neuropathology', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'peer', 'preservation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'skills', 'standard care', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vibration', 'white matter']",NIBIB,"STATE UNIVERSITY OF NY,BINGHAMTON",R00,2019,243484,0.0011956177655940048
"Rad-path-omic tools for rectal cancer treatment evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY: Of the estimated 43,030 patients who will be newly diagnosed with rectal cancer in 2018, a majority will receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NAC) to reduce tumor burden. All patients ultimately undergo an aggressive excision of the rectum, of which 25% exhibit complete pathologic response (pCR, i.e. disease- free after NAC) on the post-surgical specimen. These patients have therefore been subjected to an unnecessary, morbid procedure resulting in quality of life issues, in the absence of any definitive, non-invasive biomarkers for NAC response in vivo. While multi-parametric MRI is utilized to pre-operatively assess tumor response and regression to NAC, expert interpretation is confounded and variable due to overlapping appearance of benign treatment effects (e.g. fibrosis, ulceration) and residual tumor.  Recently, more quantitative characterization of lesions has been enabled via radiomics, involving high- throughput, computerized extraction of textural or kinetic attributes from imaging. Radiomic maps of the tumor environment can depict presence of different tissue types based on their structural and functional characteristics, visualized as regions of “low” and ‘high” feature expression. In fact, the post-NAC tumor environment on the excised rectal tissue specimen has been shown to reflect a variety and organization in different pathologic tissue types, also linked to patient prognosis and outcome. However, existing radiomic approaches only attempt to characterize the overall heterogeneity in a tissue region, as they lack “ground truth” to quantify tissue types and their organization on post-NAC MRI. A more comprehensive and accurate predictor for pCR based off multi- parametric MRI could thus be constructed by (a) quantifying the density and arrangement of structural and functional attributes on post-NAC rectal MRIs, and (b) optimizing radiomic descriptors against pathologically validated information of post-NAC tissue types on MRI, via spatial correlation with pathology.  In this proposal, I will develop novel radiomic tools in conjunction with spatially co-localized “ground truth” pathology to build a predictor for identifying rectal cancer patients exhibiting pCR via post-NAC MRI. Aim 1 will involve developing and evaluating a novel radiomic descriptor to quantify spatial organization of morphologic (via structural MRI) and physiologic (via contrast enhancement functional MRI) heterogeneity of the post-NAC lesion environment. Aim 2 will focus on optimizing this radiomic organization descriptor to capture distinctive tissue organization associated with pCR, via spatial mapping of post-surgical pathology information onto pre-operative MRI. My novel descriptor will be evaluated and validated via a machine learning predictor to identify patients exhibiting pCR using a discovery and a hold-out validation cohort, acquired from 2 different institutions; and compared with clinical markers of response. My project will build on promising preliminary results for my radiomic organization descriptor as well as a radiology-pathology co-registration framework, to result in a clinically reliable and impactful radiomics-based tool which could enable personalized management of rectal cancer patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This F31 proposal focuses on novel computational imaging tools for accurate identification and assessment of pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation via routine multi- parametric MRI. A comprehensive, quantitative assessment of post-chemoradiation tissue types and their tissue organization on imaging could enable (a) non-invasive identification of complete responders to avoid unneeded and highly morbid surgeries, and (b) more personalized management and follow-up for non-responders to NAC.",Rad-path-omic tools for rectal cancer treatment evaluation,9683190,F31CA216935,"['Appearance', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Colorectal Surgery', 'Colostomy Procedure', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In complete remission', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Morphology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Rectal Cancer', 'Rectum', 'Residual Tumors', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Sphincter', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Texture', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Markers', 'Ulcer', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'digital pathology', 'disease diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'in vivo', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'personalized management', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'rectal', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,45016,0.0109575117617473
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9638528,F30CA206291,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodal data', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,0.0468110667434005
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry. This new technology will contribute to understanding complex processes in biological tissues that play a role in both health and disease.",Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry,9782980,UG3HL145593,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Blood capillaries', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Ensure', 'Glass', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscope', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Optics', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Slide', 'Solvents', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'automated analysis', 'biological systems', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'innovation', 'interest', 'ionization technique', 'mass spectrometer', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'nano', 'nanoprobe', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'preservation', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'scale up', 'tool']",NHLBI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,UG3,2019,375000,0.018807675989747464
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9743107,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'random forest', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,605394,-0.006103597702349865
"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,9739188,U01HL142518,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Rupture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Thoracic aorta', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tunica Adventitia', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Video Microscopy', 'Work', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intracranial artery', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mucoid', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multiple omics', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,506426,0.013735169229932792
"In vivo Imaging of Neuroactivity in the Deep Forward Scattering Regime Using Speckle Identification and Demixing (SPID) Microscopy PROJECT SUMMARY Optical imaging of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain at depth and at high spatial and temporal resolution remains a key challenge in neuroscience. This is because tissue scattering eliminates directional information carried by photons, with a characteristic length scale of hundreds of microns. As a result, the remaining unscattered, or “ballistic” component of light decays exponentially with depth. Since all optical microscopy modalities rely—either in the excitation or the emission—on this ballistic component of light for image formation, the limitations imposed by scattering limit the maximally obtainable imaging depths to ~1.5 mm in the rodent brain. Hereby, we propose a systematic approach for exploring and developing a new platform for in vivo deep tissue calcium imaging that actively exploits the scattering properties of the tissue as a resource to localize, demix and extract neuronal activity traces in the millimeter depth range in the highly scattering rodent brain. Our approach utilizes the fact that the scattering process results in an accumulation of different relative phases between scattered light components, leading to the formation of deterministic but complex interference patterns known as speckles. Emission from different locations of the sample results in speckles with different intensity distributions. Thus, these patterns carry complex information about both the location of the emitter and the properties of the scattering medium. Our current results show that the obtainable contrast for these speckle patterns should be sufficient to identify, localize and demix them even for extended objects and with partially coherent light. We will design and build an array of hardware and computational tools that will allow us to systematically explore the limits within which such demixing and neuronal signal extraction can be achieved in vivo. We will use these insights and develop an optical platform for volumetric calcium imaging in the mouse brain in the deep forward-scattering regime, as well as for transcranial calcium imaging in the mouse brain. Our approach will synergistically combine the expertise on the physics of light propagation in disordered media in the Gigan Lab with the experience in machine learning, computational imaging and in vivo high-speed volumetric neuronal recording in the Vaziri Lab. Our method has the potential of opening up a new paradigm for neuronal imagining and signal extraction in the multiple scattering regime by enabling millimeter-range calcium imaging in the highly scattering rodent brain. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical recording of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain at depth with high spatial resolution remains, due to the highly scattering properties of brain tissue, a key challenge in neuroscience. This is because all microscopy modalities rely on the non-scattered ballistic component of light—which is exponentially attenuated with tissue depth—either in the excitation or the emission for image formation. We will overcome this issue by developing a deep-tissue calcium imaging platform that exploits the scattering properties of the tissue to localize, demix and extract neuronal activity traces in the millimeter range in the highly scattering rodent brain.",In vivo Imaging of Neuroactivity in the Deep Forward Scattering Regime Using Speckle Identification and Demixing (SPID) Microscopy,9828367,RF1NS113251,"['Algorithms', 'Attenuated', 'Ballistics', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Left', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Snakes', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'attenuation', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'computerized tools', 'cranium', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'in vivo', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'in vivo imaging', 'insight', 'light scattering', 'method development', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal cell body', 'neurotransmission', 'optical imaging', 'practical application', 'temporal measurement', 'two photon microscopy']",NINDS,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,RF1,2019,1549615,-0.0028601038658910153
"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype. Project Narrative Our group has established the only three-dimensional form of histology that is suitable for histopathology and quantitative tissue phenotyping, tissue X-ray microtomography (micro-CT). We outline here a plan to establish mechanisms for increasing resolution and field-of-view, to add sample multiplexing, to simply sample preparation, and to explore machine learning mechanisms for defining normal and abnormal structure towards whole-organism complete tissue phenotyping. The resulting tools will allow the community to comprehensively and computationally determine the roles of genes and environment in defining phenotype, which has implications in drug development, biomedical research, and medicine.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),9792960,R24OD018559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Genetics', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cesium', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Iodides', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve', 'Normal Range', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Preparation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spiral Computed Tomography', 'Stains', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'clinical toxicology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data sharing', 'detector', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'feature detection', 'histological studies', 'human disease', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'millimeter', 'mutant', 'programs', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2019,667280,0.003423337165132704
"An interactive deep-learning method to semi-automatically segment abdominal organs to support stereotactic MR guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) for abdominal cancers Abstract  Stereotactic MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) is an effective treatment for the pancreas and other upper abdominal cancers. SMART allows precise delivery of escalated prescription dose to the abdominal tumor targets while avoiding the complications of radiation toxicity to the mobile gastrointestinal (GI) organs surrounding the tumor target. In the clinical workflow of SMART, manual segmentation of the GI orangs at risk (OARs) is one of the most important but also the most labor-intensive steps. Manual segmentation takes 10 minutes on average but ranges from 5 to 22 minutes. The slow and costly manual segmentation step directly decreases the accessibility and affordability of online SMART and indirectly reduces the effectiveness of SMART due to intra-fractional body and organ movement of the patients. In this study, we will develop a deep-learning based interactive and semi-automatic procedure to accurately and quickly segment the GI OARs to make SMART more efficient and affordable. Stereotactic MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) has been demonstrated as an effective treatment for the pancreas and other upper abdominal cancers. For nonresectable pancreatic cancer, SMART increased the overall survival at 36 months from 18% to 55% compared to conventional radiation therapy (RT) treatment. In this study, we will develop a deep-learning based interactive and semi-automatic method to accurately and quickly segment the organs-at- risk (OAR) in the abdomen to support SMART. The method to be developed will significantly expedite the OAR segmentation step and make SMART more efficient and affordable.",An interactive deep-learning method to semi-automatically segment abdominal organs to support stereotactic MR guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) for abdominal cancers,9807610,R03EB028427,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Clinical', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dose', 'Dose-Rate', 'Duodenum', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Kidney', 'Large Intestine', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of abdomen', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Toxicity', 'Radiation therapy', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Small Intestines', 'Stomach', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'gastrointestinal', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'irradiation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preservation', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'tumor']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,89216,-0.003267514696470356
"A TOF, DOI, MRI compatible PET detector to support sub-millimeter neuroPET imaging Abstract The overall goal of this research is to develop next generation positron emission tomography (PET) detector technology to support non-invasive, quantitative brain imaging at spatial and temporal resolutions currently not achievable with human neuro-PET systems. The developed PET detector technology will also be compatible with operation in an MRI system. The proposed research is targeted to the NIH Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative. Human brain imaging with PET/MRI will be an essential tool in neuroscience studies to ""Develop innovative technologies to understand the human brain and treat its disorders; create and support integrated brain research networks."" The key advancement that we introduce is a PET detector with <100 psec time-of-flight (TOF) PET coincidence resolution, <2 mm continuous depth of interaction (DOI) positioning and intrinsic detector spatial resolution to support <1 mm PET image resolution throughout the system imaging field of view (FOV). Detector modules have been designed that individually achieve these performance metrics; however, no detector module has been designed that supports all of them. To make disruptive advancements in neuro-imaging using PET, one must push the image spatial resolution (i.e., currently 2-3 mm image resolution) as well as coincidence timing resolution and also be MRI compatible. The impact of this project is that we will advance the state of the art in all of these critical performance areas. We will achieve these goals by first understanding the role that different PET detector performance parameters have on task-based figures of merit for neuroPET imaging. We will investigate how both TOF and image resolution impact figure of merit performance for estimation, detection and characterization imaging tasks. Monte Carlo simulation will be used along with both object-based (i.e., mathematical) and anthropomorphic digital phantoms. Next we will optimize SiPM device selection, electronics and detector geometry for <100 psec TOF coincidence timing, 1 mm intrinsic spatial resolution and <2 mm DOI positioning resolution. We will build and characterize a prototype PET detector module utilizing a novel dual- sided slat crystal detector design. To advance coincidence timing performance we will investigate the use of machine learning to estimate the arrival time of detected events. Finally, we will optimize the detector design for MRI compatibility. We will fully test and characterize performance of our prototype detector on the benchtop and in a MRI scanner while running clinical MRI pulse sequences. At the end of this developmental project we will be in position to build a state of the art, MRI compatible, TOF, DOI PET imaging system. Narrative The overall goal of this work is to develop detector imaging technology that will enable new research into the development, function and aging of the human brain. This technology will allow functional imaging of the brain at higher spatial resolution and higher coincidence timing resolution than previously achieved and also facilitate simultaneous multi-modality imaging (i.e., PET/MRI) at these new levels of performance.","A TOF, DOI, MRI compatible PET detector to support sub-millimeter neuroPET imaging",9791188,R01EB026964,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Side', 'Silicon', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging detector', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'operation', 'prototype', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,22992,0.05001446068403312
"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,9802309,R01EB028337,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Crystallization', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Gamma Rays', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portugal', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain size', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response', 'retinal rods']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2019,293568,0.020991638613179125
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. It will pve the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process.",MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning,9624738,R01CA193730,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'anatomic imaging', 'attenuation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'density', 'electron density', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'primary endpoint', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,343572,-0.0045466626033080415
"I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia. 1. Executive Summary Nearly 150,000 patients in the US undergo lower extremity amputations annually secondary to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) complicated by critical limb ischemia (CLI).1,2,3 To increase a patient’s post-operative quality of life, surgeons attempt to salvage as much limb tissue as possible while also considering the likelihood of primary wound healing at a given level of amputation (LOA).4 The principal challenge in this decision is that surgeons overestimate the likelihood of healing at the selected LOA. Therefore, in the first year, 10% to 35% of amputations eventually require re-amputation to a more proximal level.5-7 This additional treatment prolongs the patient’s return to walking, worsening their condition and deteriorating their mental health. The burden to the healthcare system is immense. The average cost for each amputation is over $70,000, as evidenced by a recent publication that shows diabetic foot ulcer complications, mainly attributed to amputation, cost more than the five most costly forms of cancer.8 Despite these facts, there are no objective studies for selection of LOA in patients with PAD. To address this critical problem, Spectral MD (SMD) has developed a point-of-care imaging device (DeepView), which simultaneously performs multispectral imaging (MSI) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) imaging across the visible and infrared spectrum to obtain a quantitative microvascular tissue assessment. These optical measurements are integrated using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to provide a quantitative aid to the physician’s determination of tissue viability at a proposed amputation site. If used for routine assessment prior to amputation, SMD expects DeepView to reduce the rate of re- amputation by 70%, resulting in up to 38,000 fewer re-amputations per year while improving quality of life for amputees and reducing associated health costs. The central objective for SMD’s Phase I SBIR is to perform a feasibility clinical study to demonstrate the DeepView device will achieve greater than 90% accuracy in identifying the healing potential of tissue at the amputation site. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: Aim 1: Complete a Feasibility Study creating a database of pre-amputation images. This data will be used for construction of the AI algorithm to predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 2: Identify MSI and PPG features that can accurately predict amputation site healing potential. Aim 3: Using Aim I clinical data, finalize the AI algorithm architecture and estimate sample size needed for a Phase II Pivotal Study in which the necessary training data to achieve at least 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity will be obtained. As of this Supplement request, SMD has initiated a clinical study for feasibility and enrolled the first subject. Through collaboration with the clinical study site Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Dennis Gable, SMD developed the protocol and trained his research staff at the study site, Baylor Medical Center Plano, in the use of the DeepView device. SMD anticipates enrollment of five subjects each month over the next 6 months. The I-Corps team will consist of the following members: Michael DiMaio, MD – Role: C-Level Corporate Officer. Dr. DiMaio, MD is Founder and Chief Executive Officer of SMD and has led SMD in obtaining over $30M in non-dilutive government funding and private investments. His distinguished career includes extensive experience as an entrepreneur, clinician, and scientist. With over 20 years’ experience as a cardiovascular surgeon, Dr. DiMaio has a widespread network of physicians and hospitals from which to draw contacts for customer interviews. Jeffrey Thatcher, PhD – Role: PI. Dr. Thatcher is the Chief Scientist at SMD and is a leader in the development of diagnostic imaging for soft tissue diseases. He led SMD in conceptualizing and inventing SMD’s core imaging technology undergoing clinical trials in three wound diagnostics applications including: burns; diabetic ulcers; and amputation. Wensheng Fan, MS – Role: Industry Expert. Wensheng Fan is Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at SMD. He is an executive, entrepreneur, and innovator with over 20 years of experience in natural speech recognition and real time imaging systems. At SMD, he leads market engagement, strategic financial planning, and device development. Narrative In patients with peripheral arterial disease, reported rates of re-amputation due to non-healing of a primary amputation are very significant—approximately 20% of below-the-knee amputations require eventual revision, with even higher rates established for amputations at the level of the foot. There are no gold-standard tests for selection of level of amputation (LOA) to aid clinical judgment. To address this critical problem, SpectralMD is developing the DeepView-Gen2 imaging device that integrates multispectral imaging and a machine learning algorithm to quantitatively measure microvascular blood flow and tissue healing potential to assist in the clinical selection of LOA and minimize the incidence of re-amputation and its associated morbidity and mortality.",I-Corps Program Application for Market Assessment of Non-invasive Imaging Device to Improve Outcomes of Amputations Surgery in Critical Limb Ischemia.,9827388,R43HL142428,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Burn injury', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diabetic ulcer', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Innovation Corps', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Ischemia', 'Judgment', 'Knee', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Principal Investigator', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'S Phase', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Soft Tissue Disorder', 'Specificity', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Viability', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Wound Healing', 'career', 'cost', 'experience', 'foot', 'healing', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'point of care', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'speech recognition', 'wound']",NHLBI,"SPECTRAL MD, INC.",R43,2019,54976,0.0007024380727196965
"INTEGRATING OMICS AND QUANTITATIVE IMAGING DATA IN CO-CLINICAL TRIALS TO PREDICT TREATMENT RESPONSE IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER Project Summary Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very challenging disease because it is biologically aggressive, there are no targeted therapies, and, consequently, patients have poor prognosis. Although immunotherapy is promising for treating many cancers, TNBC lacks specific molecular targets, no predictive biomarkers to chemotherapy response have yet been identified, and treatment response is difficult to evaluate using current biomarker assessments. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC offer the exciting opportunity of evaluating this disease in terms of molecular features (e.g., genomic copy number, whole exome sequence, and mRNA expression) to identify candidate “omic” biomarkers that best predict the ultimate response to treatment and could provide surrogate endpoints to validate novel imaging biomarkers in co-clinical trial human trails. Moreover, emerging quantitative MRI methods, such as dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI), contain rich physiological signals in the images for predicting treatment response, but it is challenging to integrate both animal and human data to reliably predict the treatment response. A paradigm of “co-clinical trials” is emerging in which new treatments are evaluated in animals, and the results guide treatments in clinical trials, but there is a paucity of informatics tools and resources to enable analyses in such animal-to-human work. We believe that an informatics-based methodology that integrates molecular `omics' and imaging data will propel advances in TNBC by enabling development of machine learning models to predict the response to therapies. In order to develop research resources that will encourage consensus on how quantitative imaging methods are optimized to improve the quality of imaging results for co-clinical trials, we will leverage an ongoing co-clinical trial we are undertaking to pursue the following specific aims: (1) Identify molecular biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDX); (2) Identify quantitative MRI biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts; and (3) Evaluate our informatics tools in a prospective co-clinical trial. Our proposed research is significant and innovative because it leverages advances in basic cancer biology, state-of-the-art imaging technologies, and informatics methods to develop a resource to catalyze discovery in this important disease. Our PDX-based approach will provide the cancer community with a rational, iterative, combined pre-clinical and clinical methodology and supporting data resource for making progressively more refined and personalized therapeutic regimens for TNBC patients. Our methods and tools will likely also generalize to other cancers and could, therefore, substantially benefit the care of all cancer patients. Project Narrative Determining the optimal therapies for a specific triple negative breast cancer tumor is currently not possible, as the number of possible treatment combinations is too large to evaluate experimentally in clinical trials. Our proposed methods that leverage patient derived xenografts and machine learning analysis of integrated `omics and quantitative imaging data will provide the cancer community with a rational, iterative, combined pre-clinical and clinical trial approach and supporting data resource for making progressively more refined and personalized therapeutic regimens in these patients.

"Automatic SUV Extraction and Biodistribution Analysis of Preclinical PET Preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) plays a significant role in monitoring radiotracer biodistributions for the development of new therapies. The standardized uptake value (SUV) has become one of the most important quantitation measures in PET analysis. However, SUV extraction from PET data hinges on the ability to clearly delineate the organ region-of-interest (ROI) from an anatomical reference. Cross-comparison of different organ SUVs and biodistributions is also cumbersome due to complex registration strategies of each animal with an unknown pose and size. Operator bias and lack of efficient co-registration strategies results in poor data reproducibility, high data variability, low data throughput and prohibits the use of fully-automated data parsing and data analysis for predicting early therapy outcomes with high sensitivity. In Vivo Analytics will directly address these shortcomings by developing InVivoPET. It will be a cloud-based PET data analysis tool, which will enable automatic organ SUV extraction followed by an instantaneous biodistribution analysis. InVivoPET will automatically coregister PET images to the animal’s anatomy and will calculate biodistributions in almost real-time. InVivoPET consists of several parts. First, a Body Conforming Animal Mold (BCAM) enables consistent spatial and longitudinal registration of the animal’s pose and location to the PET data. Second, a statistical mouse atlas based on an Organ Probability Map (OPM) provides a digital and operator-independent organ ROI template. Third, a cloud-based software with a browser-based user interface enables an automatic organ SUV extraction with following biodistribution analysis. Last, machine learning and data mining algorithms can be applied in the future that will further enhance study outcomes. InVivoPET does not rely on manual delineation of organs. A machine-driven data analysis fully eliminates operator-dependent variability and increases data reproducibility. It will enable the drug development team to quantitate the impact of candidate therapeutics with the highest accuracy, reduces the time to enter clinical trials, reduces costs, and ensures the quantification and consistency of PET data. Therefore, the hypothesis is that the organ SUV can automatically be extracted from PET data using the BCAM and OPM. In Aim 1, we will modify the BCAM for housing mice with surface-protruding tumors and confirm the ability for spatially aligning mice with tumor xenografts to the OPM. In Aim 2, we will perform PET imaging of tumor bearing mice using 18F-FDG and confirm the ability for automatically extracting the organ SUV based on the OPM. The successful completion of the proposed project will help to commercialize InVivoPET, which will be sold as a plug-in to existing PET systems and as a PET- manufacturer independent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Project Narrative: InVivo Analytics seeks funding for demonstrating the feasibility of automatically analyzing radiotracer biodistributions of small animal positron emission tomography (PET). Biodistribution analysis is currently operator-dependent, time-consuming, and prone to error while reducing the reproducibility of study results.

"A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue Project Summary Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging by Time of Flight (MIBI-TOF) uses secondary ion mass spectrometry and metal conjugated primary antibodies to simultaneously visualize dozens of proteins at subcellular resolution in a single tissue section. This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution.

"New instrument and methods for fast, diagnostic-quality histology of un-embedded bone marrow and lymph node specimens Project Summary Over 600,000 bone marrow biopsies are performed every year in the United States, while hundreds of thousands more lymph node biospies are performed. Histological evaluation of these biopsies is a critical component of care for hematologic diseases including leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disease and non-neoplastic conditions such as viral infections and autoimmune conditions.  We have developed a platform that we consider a paradigm shift in the histologic examination of tissues. It is based on a new chemical process, imaging, and image processing approach that we have dubbed Clearing Histology with MultiPhoton microscopy (CHiMP).The CHiMP technology enables visual analysis of entire intact, un-embedded and uncut specimens within a short time-frame and with a resolution that is amenable to primary diagnosis. The significant clinical benefits include: 1) potential for same-day diagnosis, 2) labor and cost savings, 3) access to 3D perspective, 4) increased visual data from same specimen, 5) complete tissue preservation for ancillary studies such as DNA analysis and 6) inherent benefits of digital data such as reduced risk of loss, ready remote review by experts, and amenability to machine learning tools. Hematopoietic tissue evaluation would similarly benefit from these advantages, but unfortunately the systems developed thus far lack the resolution typically needed for visual examination of hematopoietic tissues.  For this Phase I SBIR proposal, an objective is to develop customized optics to improve the resolution of our current microscopes and thereby enable use in the specialized field of hematology. Commercially available objective lenses that are compatible with our immersion medium are either limited to numerical apertures (NA) that are less than one, affecting resolution and image quality, or have insufficient working distances for imaging past the coverslip and surface roughness to obtain complete sections. We will design and test a custom objective lens with high NA and long working distance, suited for our proprietary reagents. Integrating such a lens into our microscope will also require the design of a custom scan lens, custom beam conditioning optics, and a custom polygon scanner.  An associated goal is to develop a novel approach to preparing bone marrow aspiration specimens that will make them amenable to imaging with CHiMP, potentially reducing the need for core biopsies by permitting unambiguous morphologic categorization of cell subtypes in their architectural context, without the routine need for immunohistochemistry, and while preserving nucleic acids for molecular/genetic evaluation. Project Narrative Applikate Technologies has developed a powerful platform for histological evaluation of tissue called Clearing Histology with MultiPhoton Microscopy, or CHiMP. This platform has many advantages over traditional approaches, including same-day turn-around, reduced labor costs, preservation of tissue for DNA analysis, and direct-to-digital imaging for ease of consultation with remote experts. This proposal seeks to develop custom optics to enable very-high-resolution imaging of bone marrow and lymph node samples that are critical for diagnosing diseases such as leukemia and lymphoma.","New instrument and methods for fast, diagnostic-quality histology of un-embedded bone marrow and lymph node specimens",9677952,R43CA235890,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Ancillary Study', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Aspiration', 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Core Biopsy', 'Cost Savings', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Decalcification', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hematopathology', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lymph', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Optics', 'Pan Genus', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'hematopoietic tissue', 'high resolution imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'instrument', 'lens', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'lymph nodes', 'medical specialties', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'pre-clinical', 'preservation', 'second harmonic', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,"APPLIKATE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2019,224713,0.013824017791858986
"In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech Project Summary Tongue cancer and the treatments used to cure the disease such as glossectomy can have debilitating effects on speech and swallowing, yet not much is known about the relationship between tongue movements in speech and reconstruction choices after cancer resection. The tongue’s vital role in speaking and swallowing is executed by a uniquely complex array of muscles which deform locally into functional units. Tongue movements are governed by synergistic activation of these functional units using orthogonally oriented muscle fibers not a rigid skeletal structure. Functional units, which are regions of 3D coherent motion, are the structures that link low-level muscle activity to high-level surface tongue geometry. This link, the organization of functional units, can provide considerable insight into normal motor control and adapted tongue motion, as in patients who have had surgery for tongue cancer. However, there is poor understanding of the details of how muscle morphology contributes to function due to tongue muscle interdigitation and complex local activation. A key to understanding the relationship between the structure and function of the tongue is to identify functional units of motion in localized tongue regions and map them to muscle anatomy. A large step in this direction can be gained by developing a tool to cluster 3D coherent motion patterns from tagged MRI, and register them to muscle anatomy from high-resolution MRI. Speech motor control is a critical area of importance where platform tools for machine learning techniques are lacking. The goal of this project is to create a framework to relate the functional units to tongue muscle anatomy. This framework will enhance tongue motion analysis in medical research and clinical applications, where MRI is frequently used. To address this goal, we have already developed technologies to analyze high-resolution and tagged-MRI. The first is a detailed 3D muscle atlas based on 3D high-resolution MRI, which depicts the locations of both extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, and will be registered to each speaker to identify and track their muscles in the 3D tagged data sets. The second is software to derive 3D displacement and strain fields from tagged MR images. These displacements, strains, and derived quantities will be used to extract spatio-temporal feature vectors that define coherent regions, which will be verified with simulation. The vectors will then be input into a novel computational method using a NMF and clustering, the goal of which is to establish the functional units of speech. In addition, biomechanical simulations will be used to co-validate our findings. The concept of functional units is at the core of the proposed work, as it can provide insights into tongue muscle coordination in patients after glossectomy surgery. The research plan comprises two specific aims: (1) develop a computational method to establish functional units from MRI and (2) determine the relationship between alterations in anatomy and alterations in functional unit motion after tongue cancer treatment. Linking the functional units to the anatomy will allow the design of more focused treatments and therapies for tongue motion-related disorders. Project Narrative Functions of the tongue—speaking, eating, and breathing—are executed by using a complex muscular array to create global motions (synergies) by deforming local functional units which are intermediate structures that link muscle activity to surface tongue geometry. This project will develop new computational tools that will enable researchers and clinicians to determine the functional units of specific motions and relate them to the muscle anatomy. Such a breakthrough will dramatically improve our knowledge of the mechanisms of muscle coordination, thereby permitting improvement of diagnosis and treatment of tongue motion-related disorders.",In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech,9636557,R21DC016047,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Bone structure', 'Breathing', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elements', 'Excision', 'Geometry', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Unit of Measure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical application', 'computational basis', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital', 'functional independence', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malignant tongue neoplasm', 'motor control', 'multidimensional data', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'reconstruction', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2019,210725,-0.05282548995538256
"MDCT Quantification of hepatic tumor viability for assessment of cancer therapy Project Summary / Abstract Tumor imaging quantification is critical for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is the clinical imaging modality commonly used for patients diagnosed with hepatic malignancy because of its relatively low cost and wide availability. Conventional tumor quantification using either linear or volumetric measurement has demonstrated significant limitations in the evaluation of malignant liver tumors such as for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when being treated with targeted antiangiogenic therapies or locoregional therapies because changes in overall tumor size do not necessarily reflect tumor response to therapy. This leads to an unmet clinical demand to develop a functional tumor quantification biomarker for effective and accurate assessment of treatment response for liver cancer patients. The goal of this STTR project is to expand development of our functional tumor quantitative imaging biomarker (QIB), named hepatic tumor viability (HTV), for automated quantification of tumor viability of HCC using contrast-enhanced multi-phase hepatic MDCT images. The proposed HTV tool will be built upon existing technologies for quantitative imaging analysis of liver and liver tumors developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using the MDCT datasets of 400 patients with advanced HCC treated with antiangiogenic therapies and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of HTV biomarker: We will continue to enhance the HTV biomarker developed in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy of HCC tumor segmentation using machine-learning classifiers, and to expand the four-phase MDCT imaging protocol developed in Phase I to include that of three-phase MDCT by omitting pre-contrast imaging for flexible adoption in clinical practice, (2) Evaluation of HTV biomarker: We will integrate the HTV biomarker into our 3DQI platform to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and clinical performance of the proposed HTV biomarker in the assessment of treatment response by assessing 400 advanced HCC cases treated with antiangiogenic and TACE therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center, and (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for 3DQI/Liver to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission. This aim is important for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of advanced QIBs developed on the 3DQI/Liver platform for tumor monitoring and response assessment of varied hepatic diseases on both CT and MR images. The successful development and validation of the proposed HTV biomarker will have a high clinical impact by providing a more effective and accurate tumor quantification tool compared to conventional size-based methods for reliable assessment of tumor progression and evaluation of treatment response for patients with HCC. Project Narrative Tumor imaging quantification is indispensable for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is often the modality used because of its relatively low cost and wide availability.

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9767744,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2019,651460,0.04375482679544129

In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9895187,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2019,73936,0.04375482679544129
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9786824,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,192564,0.007655652363801158
"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9753130,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Privatization', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'feature detection', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,567509,0.015208289015528108
"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9665259,R01CA197000,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Burden', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Image', 'In complete remission', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Property', 'Registries', 'Residual Cancers', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'computerized tools', 'experimental arm', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'secondary endpoint', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,471560,0.049247591432158004
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9663985,R01HL115828,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Sex Differences', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'aortic valve', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data archive', 'data pipeline', 'data sharing', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,740572,0.02284912762585804
"Hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT: A new paradigm for image guidance in liver SBRT ABSTRACT This proposal aims to establish a hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for precision image guidance in radiation therapy of liver cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) improves the treatment outcome over conventional fractionated radiotherapy by delivering high fractional dose in few fractions. However, SBRT of liver cancer still has high local failure rate up to 20-30% at 2-3 years and high overall grade>=3 toxicity rate up to 30% with patient deaths from the treatment. Previous studies demonstrated a strong correlation between the treatment outcome and the tumor localization accuracy of the image guidance technique used. Currently, cone beam CT (CBCT) is the most widely used imaging technique for liver SBRT. However, CBCT has extremely limited soft tissue contrast with no visualization of most liver tumors. As a result, its localization error is frequently over 6mm, and the dose coverage of tumor volume can fall below 90%, which is far from enough for tumor control. Drastically reducing localization errors is imperative to improve the outcome of liver SBRT. Combined MRI-Radiotherapy machines could provide MRI contrast for liver tumor localization. However, such machines are rare and expensive for most clinics. As such, an alternative solution is urgently required to meet the ubiquitous need of all radiation oncology departments: a solution in the form of a novel low-cost imaging system with MRI equivalent contrast. Since CBCT is readily available on most radiotherapy machines, creating CBCT-based imaging systems would be the most effective strategy. Our recent publication demonstrated the feasibility of such strategy. (Harris, Med Phys 2018) Our long-term goal is to establish the next generation of CBCT systems with virtual multi-modality imaging capabilities for high precision tumor localization and adaptive therapy in radiation therapy. In this application, our overall objective is to establish a novel system to generate hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT from CBCT, with virtual-MRI inside the liver for target localization and augmented CBCT outside the liver for healthy tissue verification. The specific aims are: (1). Establish a 3D hybrid virtual- MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in breath-hold liver SBRT without respiratory motion. (2). Establish a 4D hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in free-breathing liver SBRT with respiratory motion. (3). Optimize and clinically evaluate the systems through simulation studies and a prospective clinical trial. Our expected deliverables through the academic-industrial partnership are novel hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT systems ready to be integrated to all radiotherapy machines with only CBCT systems. This new imaging capability will have significant clinical impact because it will create a paradigm shift in image-guided radiation therapy by revolutionizing the widely used CBCT systems to enable a new era of low-cost high-precision virtual multi- modality guided radiotherapy. This precision guidance can lead to breakthrough in escalating the tumor control and minimizing the toxicities of liver SBRT as well as treatments of other sites with tumors in the soft tissue. Project Narrative The hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system will be a low-cost imaging system with superb soft tissue contrast to provide precise image guidance for liver SBRT, which paves the road to further margin reduction and dose escalation. As a result, this novel system has a great potential to enhance the tumor local control and reduce the normal tissue toxicities for all patients under liver SBRT treatments. Finally yet importantly, the hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system can also be potentially applicable for improving the image guidance precision of radiation therapy treatments of other clinical sites with tumors in the soft tissue, such as breast and prostate cancers.",Hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT: A new paradigm for image guidance in liver SBRT,9801976,R01EB028324,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Breathing', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Fractionated radiotherapy', 'Goals', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Patients', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Residual state', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Volume', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'falls', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'oncology', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recursive neural network', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,553348,0.02137292409508279
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9747360,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'efficacy testing', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'preclinical efficacy', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2019,531751,-0.0073591010852733256
"Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer The goal of this research is to clinically translate software tools we developed through the Quantitative Imaging Network and validate their ability to assess the response of cancer in clinical trials. Current RECIST response criteria are inadequate to detect tumor changes in targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapies, two of the most promising avenues for drug discovery. We hypothesize that innovative volumetric and radiomics signatures of response and progression, identified using our quantitative CT imaging tools, can be integrated into clinical trial workflow to meet the urgent need for alternatives to RECIST criteria. Two large multi-site trials present a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in one disease treated with multiple therapeutic options driven by tissue biomarkers. S0819 is a completed Phase III trial with 1300+ patients and Lung- MAP (S1400) is an ongoing first-of-its-kind Phase II/III model projected to enroll up to 5,000 patients using a multi-drug, targeted screening approach to match patients with sub-studies testing investigational treatments based on their unique tumor profiles. Aim 1 tests whether change in tumor volume over time, measured by our advanced volumetric segmentation algorithms, outperforms unidimensional RECIST 1.1 response criteria. Aim 2 correlates genomic mutations identified in S0819 and Lung-MAP with radiomics signatures constructed by our machine learning models, with the goal of developing a non-invasive, easily repeatable virtual biopsy through CT imaging. Aim 3 validates the prediction of clinical outcomes using early biomarkers of response and progression based on quantitative CT-based radiomic features, hypothesized to outperform both RECIST and volumetrics alone across therapeutic options including chemotherapies, targeted molecular agents, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our work has substantial health significance because validation of volume and radiomic changes as early biomarkers of response or progression will guide clinical trials for drug discovery and help match patients to personalized treatment. Response criteria developed through this study will be widely applicable to clinical practice because CT is the most common cancer imaging modality and the quantitative image analysis tools can easily be incorporated into existing popular imaging platforms and clinical workflow, reducing the time required by radiologists. Data from this project, including anonymized imaging data (CT for all patients and PET for a large subset), clinical meta- data, and lesion mark-ups by independent radiologists, will be shared for use by other researchers through the TCGA Cancer Imaging Archive, continuing an extensive history of data sharing by this team. This work will improve drug discovery for promising new classes of therapies by creating innovative response criteria based on volumetric and radiomics signatures developed with prior support by the QIN and now validated in two large multi-site clinical trials studying multiple therapeutic options in the most important histologic types of lung cancer and most commonly used imaging modality, CT. Results are expected to be applied to other tumor types and help match patients to the treatment that works best for them.","Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer",9699454,U01CA225431,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carboplatin', 'Cetuximab', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunotherapy', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paclitaxel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'drug discovery', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'genomic signature', 'image archival system', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'mutant', 'mutational status', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic value', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2019,601400,-0.04645130340442586
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9669022,R01EB016695,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,569563,-0.007416126399798103
"Expanding field-of-view with reduced tissue displacement in micro-endoscopic computational imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Optical imaging methods are well-established in neuroscience, but high-speed, high- resolution volumetric imaging of neural activity in deep tissue remains a challenge. A number of techniques address limited aspects of this goal, and most are applicable primarily to acute preparations. We propose to develop and test a novel approach to achieve three-dimensional “deep-tissue” imaging for high spatial and temporal resolution neural recording by combining aspects of embedded optical probes with computational imaging techniques. Rather than use a single micro-endoscopic probe, we propose to utilize an array of narrower probes, or optrodes, to reduce the volume of tissue displacement. Computational imaging through each probe can be performed to achieve a field of view (FOV) at a desired distance from the probe tip. Combining the fields of view from multiple probes arranged in an array then provides a composite image field that is much larger than achievable from a single micro-endoscope. In our approach, each ∼0.1 mm diameter probe of the array acts as an independent micro- endoscope. In order to achieve full-field imaging across the array, the individual fields must intersect, and the computational method must be scaled to accommodate, and stitch, multiple fields. In pursuit of these goals, we propose three Aims: Optimizing the FOV of a single micro-endoscope - The purpose of this Aim is to characterize the FOV for an individual probe at multiple depths, and optimize the FOV to about 0.3mm through control over the shape of the probe tip and light collection numerical aperture. Accelerating calibration and reconstruction - In this Aim, we will pursue efficient computational approaches for calibration based upon ray-tracing simulations and image reconstruction based on deep learning. Scaling the FOV with an endoscope array - The computational image reconstruction method will be scaled to accommodate small micro-endoscope arrays (e.g. 4 element) arranged in a hexagonal lattice with FOV of 0.6mm at a 1.5mm depth. NARRATIVE Imaging deep inside tissue, including the brain, is critical to understanding various biological processes. Doing so through a small probe is also of primary importance for minimizing tissue damage. In this proposal, we apply computational techniques to create fluorescent images using an array of microscopic glass needles to guide light in and out of a mouse brain. The simplicity and small footprint of our system have the potential for deep-brain imaging (depths > 1.5 mm) across a large (mm) field of view, which should enable a wide variety of biological and neuroscience studies in the future.",Expanding field-of-view with reduced tissue displacement in micro-endoscopic computational imaging,9829467,R21EY030717,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Coupled', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Endoscopes', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fluorescent Probes', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Holography', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Miniaturization', 'Mus', 'Needles', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Penetration', 'Preparation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'absorption', 'adaptive optics', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fluorescence imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'lens', 'microendoscope', 'multi-photon', 'neural circuit', 'novel strategies', 'optical fiber', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinal rods', 'simulation', 'temporal measurement']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2019,456800,0.03943855091293029
"Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging Project Summary In this project we want to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric  metabolic maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution. The key to this new technology is the novel combination of three state-of-the-art imaging concepts: (A) new hardware that enables the simultaneous  measurement of multinuclear magnetic resonance (MR) signals at different frequencies; (B) the flexibility and robustness of Plug-and-Play (PnP) MR Fingerprinting (MRF); and (C) a data fusion process driven by a cross-modality model based on statistical learning. For brevity, we will call this fused simultaneous multinuclear PnP-MRF technique MNF (Multi-Nuclear Fusion). The idea behind MNF is to rapidly capture two different kinds of quantitative  information throughout the whole brain in one single scan: (1) structural information from proton (1H) MRF such as T1, T2, and proton density (PD) (tissue-scale morphology); and (2) metabolic information related to ion  homeostasis from sodium (23Na) MRF, such as intracellular sodium concentration, and intracellular, extracellular and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume fractions (cellular-scale function). Because PnP-MRF can quantify multiple  tissue properties free of experimental bias, it enables us to employ statistical learning to discover a subject-specific cross-modality model that integrates all voxelwise inter-relationships between the multi-parametric 1H PnP-MRF (acquired at high resolution, 0.75-1 mm) and 23Na PnP-MRF (acquired at low resolution, 3-5 mm) maps. These subject-specific relations can subsequently be used to sharpen the 23Na metabolic maps to match the resolution of the 1H structural maps. The high-resolution 23Na maps will enable the assessment of metabolic processes in vivo and bridge the gap in resolution that has held back our ability to study metabolism in the living human brain, which is crucial for our understanding of the brain itself and the afflictions that affect it. This proof-of-concept implementation will be developed at 7 T, but it is expected to be adaptable to clinical 3 T MR scanners. The specific aims are: (1) Data acquisition, (1.a) multi-channel 1H/23Na RF array, (1.b) simultaneous multinuclear 3D MRF sequence; (2) Data processing, (2.a) PnP-MRF reconstruction for both 1H data (fingerprint matching to generate structural maps) and 23Na data (tissue 4-compartment model and simulation of spin 3/2 dynamics to generate metabolic maps), (2.b) cross-modality model using statistical learning, and data fusion algorithm to generate high-resolution metabolic maps; (3) Method validation, (3.a) accuracy and precision, (3.b) repeatability and reproducibility.(3) Exploratory aim: Test MNF on patients with chronic steno-occlusive disease, with  recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA)/minor stroke, presenting regional brain ischemia, at 3 time points (baseline, 8-month and 16-month follow-ups), and comparison with healthy controls. Project Narrative We propose to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric metabolic 3D maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution, based on the fusion of simultaneously acquired proton and sodium data with plug-and-play magnetic resonance fingerprinting. The fusion algorithm between high- resolution proton structural maps and low-resolution sodium metabolic maps will be based on a cross-modality model optimized with statistical learning methods, and will generate for the first time high-resolution metabolic maps related to ion homeostasis in the brain in vivo. These new fused high-resolution structural and metabolic maps will provide new insights into neuro-architecture, neuro-biochemistry and their interconnection, which are crucial for our understanding of the human brain and its disorders.",Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging,9731533,R01EB026456,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Biochemistry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Fluid', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracellular Fluid', 'Ions', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'hemodynamics', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'molecular imaging', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'reconstruction', 'simulation']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,622031,-0.0020214062620473954
"Distinguishing Lipid Subtypes by Amplifying Contrast from J-Coupling Project Summary/Abstract With the global rise in obesity-related diseases and increasing recognition of the role of fat in diseases such as fatty liver, there is growing need for a noninvasive chemical assay of in vivo lipid depots. But the rich chemistry of these molecules is often ignored in MRI, which typically treats fat as a homogeneous proton species because differences in chemical shift and relaxation are difficult to distinguish in a clinical setting. Innovation: This proposal will be the first to use nonuniform echo spacing to generate J-coupling based contrast between chemically different fats. While fat spins often give monotonically decaying signal under a uniformly spaced spin echo train, J-coupling causes nonuniformly spaced spin echo trains to generate complex fingerprints, which distinguish and even quantify fats with otherwise similar MR properties. Significance: The immediate clinical impact will be to demonstrate a novel J-coupling based contrast mechanism in vivo which will contribute to a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish the 25% of the population with benign steatosis from the 2-3% with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The broader significance of this work is that this novel contrast mechanism could revolutionize the study and clinical management of many diseases associated with bioactive lipid subtypes. Approach: The aims are designed to test the hypothesis that nonuniform echo trains (1) can create contrast between different fats, which (2) will contribute to a multiparametric noninvasive protocol to distinguish benign steatosis and NASH. Aim 1 will identify the echo spacing best suited for distinguishing benign steatosis and NASH, first using density matrix simulations based on high resolution spectra of liver fat from animals with each disease, and then using experiments on whole rat livers. In Aim 2, the sequence developed in Aim 1 will be tested in humans with biopsy proven benign steatosis or NASH, along with a suite of standard methods of liver and fat characterization. This metric, and also metrics derived from conventional images, will be tested for the ability to separate these patient groups. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be used to find a metric that combines multiecho intensities with standard MR metrics. This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains as a new contrast mechanism and yield a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis and NASH. Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes. The results of this work will justify a larger scale study to properly validate the sensitivity to different fat species in humans. Project Narrative This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains both as a new J-coupling based contrast mechanism and as part of a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis (~25% of the population) from patients on the NASHfibrosiscirrhosis trajectory of metabolically induced liver disease (2- 3% of the population). Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes.

"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,9754130,R01EB009690,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'patient tolerability', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,683589,0.020935329441825325
"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9688116,R01AR068456,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Bone structure', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'fracture risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2019,275934,0.01821495207873368
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,9817807,R01AR074492,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Arthralgia', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Spur', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone remodeling', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Fluoride Ion', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Needs Assessment', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteotomy', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone', 'bone metabolism', 'cartilage metabolism', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'gait examination', 'gait retraining', 'imaging approach', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'joint loading', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mineralization', 'molecular marker', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'subchondral bone', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,561592,0.06801006689783577
"Cloud quantitative imaging for whole-body tumor burden in neurofibromatoses Project Summary / Abstract The neurofibromatoses (NFs), including NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis, are a group of autosomal-dominant neurogenetic disorders characterized by a predisposition in virtually 100% of patients to develop multiple nerve sheath tumors. The determination of tumor burden on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indispensable for the longitudinal management of NF patients, which includes life-long follow-up for the monitoring of tumor progression and the assessment of treatment response. However, volumetric quantification of NF tumors is not a clinical routine because of the technical challenges in the accurate and reproducible segmentation of highly-irregular and infiltrating NF tumors, in particular plexiform neurofibromas on MRI. The goal of this STTR project is to develop cloud quantitative imaging (CQI) for NF software, denoted as CQI-NF, which will provide the technical and clinical service for volumetric quantification of NF tumors on whole-body and regional MRI via ""virtualization"" (cloud computing) technology. The product developed in this STTR will provide access to this technology for the NF clinical community nationwide and worldwide without the excessive cost to maintain on-site advanced volumetric imaging analysis software and hardware. This project will be built upon existing technologies for volumetric imaging analysis developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using 200 longitudinal whole-body and regional MRI cases collected from the NF community worldwide. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of CQI-NF system: We will continue to develop the CQI-NF system prototyped in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy and efficiency of segmentation by paralleling dynamic-threshold level set (DT level set) in multi-server platform, combining deep-learning in DT level set for the segmentation of NF tumors, and to translate the CQI-NF system from 3DQI/NF into a private cloud platform (such as TeraRecon's iNtuition CLOUD) for the provision of volumetric quantification of NF using a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model in the NF community. (2) Evaluation of CQI-NF system: We will conduct a retrospective clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of the CQI-NF system in the longitudinal monitoring of 200 NF patients collected at MGH Cancer Center and our clinical collaborators worldwide in the NF community. (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for CQI-NF to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of CQI-NF. The successful development and validation of the proposed CQI-NF system will have a high clinical impact in the NF community by providing a cloud-computing infrastructure for the volumetric imaging analysis of NF on MRI, which is not available in current clinical routine, thereby leading to a substantial advance in the longitudinal management of NF patients. Project Narrative The determination of whole-body tumor burden is indispensable for the management of neurofibromatosis (NF) patients, which includes life-long follow-up for the monitoring of tumor progression and assessment of treatment response. This STTR phase II project continues to develop the cloud quantitative imaging for NF (CQI-NF) software that was prototyped in Phase I based on the core technology developed at the MGH 3D Imaging Lab.

"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9759874,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2019,399937,-0.0356148556763926
"Development and Dissemination of Clinical CEST MRI Acquisition and Analysis Methods for Cancer Imaging Applications This research plan will continue our development of Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI acquisition and analysis methods for imaging patients with cancer. AcidoCEST MRI with an exogenous contrast agent is an innovative variation of this technique that measures extracellular pH in solid tumors. We have also developed an exceptionally innovative method that acquires endogenous CEST MR images with multiple powers, which can measure the chemical exchange rate of endogenous proteins that can assess relative differences in pH. We will improve our CEST MRI acquisition methods by accelerating the imaging speed, reducing and eliminating complications due to patient motion, eliminating complications caused by fat signal, and expanding to 3D imaging methods. We will also improve image analysis methods that are required for CEST contrast from endogenous proteins and exogenous contrast agents.  Our research has strong impact because acidoCEST MRI can track changes in tumor acidosis in response to chemotherapy and chemoradiation therapy in patients who have breast cancer and head & neck cancer. Endogenous CEST MRI can improve the diagnoses of brain tumor recurrence vs. pseudoprogression, and evaluations of lung cancer vs. lung infection. We will perform clinical studies with our endogenous and exogenous CEST MRI methods to image patients with brain, breast, lung, and head & neck cancers.  To amplify the impact of our research, we will develop versions of our CEST MRI acquisition methods for the many versions of the 13 Siemens hardware platforms and software operating systems at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. We will also develop user-friendly CEST analysis methods for many researchers at MD Anderson. We will leverage our unique research environment and expertise with intra-institutional dissemination to provide inter-institutional dissemination, by sharing share these acquisition and analysis tools with other CEST MRI researchers. We will collaborate with NIST to provide the first CEST MRI phantom that can standardize the development and implementation of intra- and inter-institutional CEST MRI methods.  Our team of outstanding investigators includes experts in CEST saturation methods, CEST MR image analysis, clinical contrast agents, rapid MRI acquisition methods, high field 7T MRI, clinical radiology, biostatistics, histopathology and oncology. Based on our expertise and years of productivity in clinical CEST MRI, we have developed an exceptional research approach. As the world's largest cancer center and a health destination, the MD Anderson Cancer Center has the patient population that provides very strong institutional support for our clinical studies. NARRATIVE We will develop new acquisition and analysis methods that assess tumor acidosis with CEST MRI, using exogenous CEST agents and endogenous sources of CEST contrast. We will apply our new methods to evaluate tumor acidosis in patients with breast, head & neck, lung, and brain cancers.

"Phase 1 cross over biodistribution study of [203Pb]VMT01 for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and [68Ga]VMT02 for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of stage 4 melanoma SIGNIFICANCE: Melanoma incidence is rising faster than any other cancer and metastatic melanoma is typically fatal. Responses to targeted and immunotherapies can be remarkable, but low response rates, acquired resistance, and adverse side effects limit long-term quality of life for these patients. The overall response rate to all therapies remains dismally near 50% and the 5-year survival is <25%. Preclinical studies have identified radiolabeled peptides that target the melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) as a potential therapeutic alternative. While this approach using -particle emitters has been largely ineffective preclinically, previous publications and our Phase I data have demonstrated efficacy of Viewpoint’s MC1R-targeted VMT01 -particle therapy in mice bearing melanoma tumors. Thus, VMT01 is designed to meet the significant unmet medical need to improve outcomes for these patients (initial indication of progressive stage 4 metastatic melanoma), with potential for expanded indications in combination with FDA-approved melanoma drugs (e.g., immunotherapies). In this revised Phase II SBIR project, Viewpoint will complete a Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial to determine the safety of its companion diagnostics. It is further expected that the company will have gained a preliminary understanding of the effectiveness of [68Ga]VMT02 imaging (PET) to identify MC1R positive tumors and the utility of [203Pb]VMT01 imaging (SPECT) for performing patient dosimetry for personalized [212Pb]VMT01 -therapy. PREDICATE PHASE I MILESTONES include: efficacy (therapy and imaging) in mice; pharm/tox of lead VMT01; automated radiopharmaceutical production with GMP kits; exclusive licenses to IP; clinical consortium with Mayo Clinic and 203Pb supply with Lantheus Medical Imaging; CRO for statistics/clinical data (Compleware, Inc.); and a radiopharmacy partner (Hotshots Nuclear Medicine) for manufacturing/distribution of [203Pb]VMT01. EQUITY INVESTMENTS: Viewpoint has secured $650,000 in equity investment to establish manufacturing of 212Pb generators for future clinical therapy trials. The company will complete the following Aims toward its goals. AIM 1. Secure FDA “safe to proceed” designation to conduct the Phase 1 imaging trial of [203Pb]VMT01 and [68Ga]VMT02 under IND. AIM 2. Complete a Phase 1 safety and biodistribution study of [203Pb]VMT01 and [68Ga]VMT02 imaging in human subjects and demonstrate their utility for identifying MC1R positive tumors and performing patient-specific dosimetry. OUTCOMES: We expect to demonstrate the clinical safety of [203Pb]VMT01 and [68Ga]VMT02. We further expect to develop preliminary understanding of the efficacy of [68Ga]VMT02 PET/CT to identify MC1R+ tumors and the utility of [203Pb]VMT01 SPECT/CT for patient-specific dosimetry for [212Pb]VMT01 -therapy. Thus, we will be prepared to initiate dosimetry-based trials of [212Pb]VMT01 -particle therapy for metastatic melanoma to be funded under Phase IIB SBIR studies and Phase III equity investments. This project aims to complete a Phase 1 trial of companion diagnostics that would be used for patient selection and dosimetry for an radionuclide therapy for metastatic melanoma.

"Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT Project Summary: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. Diagnosis and stratification of disease phenotypes are important in order to decipher the effects of novel therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individuals. Few computerized diagnostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with visual and surgical lung biopsy; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good predictive models with localized region exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use as a derivative dataset the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF and 266 patients with IPF suspected, but not IPF based on HRCT and the surgical biopsy who have participated in multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for high through-put quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier with features of anatomic distribution and reproducible imaging features expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score, testing on separate data from in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitial Lung Disease Program. Furthermore, the second aim is to develop a rate of progression at local region and to aggregate predictive models using Cox proportional regression models, which will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that diagnose and anticipate disease course in patients with IPF and subdividing patients into more homogeneous groups prior to the development of significant respiratory impairment. We anticipate that models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions to define more homogeneous cohorts for purposes of testing new targeted therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. Relevance to Public Health: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rate of progression is highly variables, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using new drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to diagnose and predict disease course robustly in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with IPF and non-IPF with reducing chance of lung biopsy and predict slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more time to treat patients and timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT,9765383,R21HL140465,"['Acute', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stable Disease', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'functional decline', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,113241,-0.03224780337242044
"A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials Project Summary/Abstract There has been a shift to greater use of neadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in the clinical management of cancer. Often used in breast cancer to provide systemic treatment for possible or apparent metastatic disease, NACT also reduces the primary tumor size and facilitates breast conservation. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is an effective diagnostic for monitoring tumor regression. There are many methodologies being developed for monitoring cancer in vivo, including contrast agent washout, volumetry, and more recently correlating apparent diffusion coefficients and proton relaxation times to tumor staging. Such imaging biomarkers are predictive of the pathological complete response (pCR) outcome prior to surgery. This enables physicians to provide “evidence based” treatment modifications to reduce deleterious side effects and improve patient outcomes. To obtain quantitative data from MR images, the variations that occur in imaging as a result of hardware and software differences between MRI manufacturers and day-to-day operations must be quantified. In MRI, the data depends on the protocols used to acquire the image, resulting in inconsistencies if even one parameter in the protocol changes. The goal of the proposed work is to produce and develop and disseminate a ground truth physical standard and quality control program for comparison of MRI scanners in the multisite I-SPY2 (ACRIN 6698) trials monitoring pre-operative chemotherapy treatments in the reduction of tumor size. The physical standard is an anthropomorphic breast phantom capable of fitting into all commercial breast coils. It contains novel human tissue mimics and geometric standards with values traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Analysis software capable of protocol compliance checks, rapid identification of the regions of interest, and comparison to ground truth values as measured by NIST will be developed to complement the physical standard. This will enable qualification of sites and quantification of error resulting from scanner performance alone. Given the wide breadth of parameter space that MRI protocols encompass, part of the proposed effort will include the development of protocols specific to image acquisition of tumor volumes and for measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient within the tumor volumes as compared to surrounding healthy tissue.

"The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform: An intuitive tool facilitating secure multi-institutional collaboration ABSTRACT: Accurate segmentation of solid tumors is challenging, due to their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location, as well as their appearance variation caused by the diversity of medical imaging. Manual annotation is tedious, prone to misinterpretation, human error, and observer bias. All these factors hinder further image analysis towards understanding tumor radio-phenotypes, predicting clinical outcomes, and monitoring progression patterns. Computational competitions have been seeking optimal advanced computational segmentation algorithms (ACSAs) for specific abnormalities, by pooling multi-institutional data together and benchmarking ACSAs from international groups. Along these lines, we have been successfully leading the organization of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, since 2012, towards a publicly-available pooled dataset of 542 multi-parametric MRI scans of glioma patients from 19 institutions. In the summarized analysis of all BraTS results, we have shown that although individual ACSAs do not outperform the gold standard agreement across expert clinicians, their fusion does outperform it, in terms of both accuracy and consistency across subjects. Towards the wider application of these ACSAs, in 2017 we created the BraTS algorithmic repository to make available Docker containers of individual ACSAs, created by BraTS participants. However, fusion of these ACSAs is still out of reach for clinical researchers, as there is no graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate it, and execution of such algorithms requires substantial computational background by the user. Furthermore, although competitions such as BraTS have shown promise, they cannot easily scale due to the requirement of pooling patient data from multiple institutions to a single location, that often faces legal, privacy, and data-ownership concerns. These concerns motivate distributed learning solutions, where the data are always retained within their institutions. We have been investigating such solutions to avoid the current paradigm of multi-institutional collaboration, i.e., data-sharing, and considering their potential multi-institutional adoption, with respect to privacy, scalability, and performance, we found federated learning (FL) to be most appropriate. In FL, each institution trains a model and shares it (without patient data) with an aggregation server, which then integrates institutional models in parallel and distributes back a consensus model. In this proposal, we focus on developing the open- source Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform, which with a user-friendly GUI will aim at i) bringing pre- trained models of various ACSAs and their fusion closer to clinical experts, and ii) allowing secure multi- institutional collaborations via FL to improve these pre-trained models without sharing patient data, thereby overcoming legal, privacy, and data-ownership challenges. Successful completion of this project will lead to an easy-to-use potentially-translatable tool enabling easy, fast, objective, repeatable and accurate tumor segmentation, without requiring a computational background by the user, and while facilitating further analysis of tumor radio-phenotypes towards accelerating discovery. NARRATIVE: Successful completion of this project will lead to a clinically translatable, easy-to-use software tool that offers a) pre-trained tumor segmentation models and their fusion, to perform better than experts, and b) a federated learning framework facilitating secure multi-institutional collaborations to improve these pre-trained models without the need to share patient data, thereby overcoming legal, privacy, and data-ownership challenges, towards accelerating research of cancer radio-phenotypes.",The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform: An intuitive tool facilitating secure multi-institutional collaboration,9826761,U01CA242871,"['Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Docking', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Observer Variation', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Radio', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'contrast enhanced', 'graphical user interface', 'human error', 'improved', 'interactive tool', 'light weight', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'repository', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U01,2019,378519,0.015813274755835893
"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders. This project will develop a robust noninvasive imaging technique using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that offers high spatial resolution, resistance to head motion and accurate quantification of cerebral blood flow in children and adolescents.

"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop 3-D imaging flow cytometry platforms for fluorescent or absorbing (stained) cells at high resolution and high throughput in a flow configuration. The developed systems will be built upon two novel snapshot 3-D techniques developed by the PI in combination with most rigorous 3-D optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies.

"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET. While the imaging developments are generally applicable to all PET tracers in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, since cancer is the primary clinical application of PET, we will focus our investigation and optimization in this project on three lung cancer imaging tracers at different clinical adoption stages as examples: 1) 18F-FDG as a routine clinical tracer, 2) 18F-FMISO for hypoxia studies as a tracer for human research, and 3) 18F-PD-L1 that specifically binds to human PD-L1 in tumors and other organs as a recent first-in-human tracer.

"A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain Project Summary  In this project, we propose to validate and characterize ﬁber orientation estimation from diffusion tensor imag- ing (DTI) through the optimization of a multi-modality, multi-scale imaging pipeline for whole mouse brains. DTI is a powerful tool used to noninvasively report 3D microstructural properties of nervous tissue on a macroscopic scale, and has played an important role in the understanding and diagnosis of a number of neurological disease processes. Modern acquisitions of DTI data can be processed to generate a 3D diffusion proﬁle known as an orientation diffusion function (ODF) at each voxel. The ODF is used to infer the orientation of local axon ﬁber pop- ulations. Previous efforts to validate these orientation estimates have primarily relied on serial optical histology as a ground truth dataset. Histology-based pipelines involve the labor intensive task of physically sectioning the tissue into thin slices, leading to physical destruction of the sample and anisotropic resolution. These limitations potentially confound the accuracy of 3D orientation estimation, complicate the process of spatially registering the ground-truth and DTI datasets, and limit quantitative comparisons to select regions of interest (ROI) across the brain sample.  In recent years, synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) has emerged as a powerful tool for high-resolution tissue imaging. With a mosaic projection-stitching method, a whole mouse brain can be imaged at an isotropic, 3D resolution of 1.2 microns after prior imaging with DTI. To enhance microCT contrast, the tis- sue specimens are ﬁxed and stained with the same kind of metal-based stains used in electron microscopy (EM) prior to embedding in resin. We will optimize this microCT-EM validation pipeline to address the limitations of pre- vious histology-based studies, and characterize DTI algorithm performance across a whole mouse brain using micron- to nano-scale neurological information.  The speciﬁc aims of the proposal are: (1) model phase contrast to optimize microCT data acquisition, (2) vali- date DTI ODF reconstruction methods using ground-truth microCT (3) characterize DTI performance using under- lying tissue microstructure information from EM. Upon completion, aim 1 will generate a novel theoretical model and acquisition strategy to exploit microCT phase contrast in strongly absorbing biological samples. Aim 2 will generate a ground-truth dataset of ODFs across a whole mouse brain, which will be used to calculate algorithm- speciﬁc spatial maps of DTI performance. In Aim 3, around 20 ROI will be selected for nano-scale imaging with EM, and DTI performance will be characterized by quantitative features of the underlying neural architecture. These results will provide an unprecedented microstructure-driven understanding of the DTI signal, allowing fu- ture studies to develop more advanced DTI models and acquisition strategies to better leverage ﬁber orientation and connectivity information in the treatment of neurological disease. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to use synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography and serial electron microscopy to validate diffusion MRI reconstruction methods. This unprecedented pipeline allows for imaging the same tissue across scales ranging from hundreds of microns to tens of nanometers. The high resolution modalities will provide insight into the true neurological microstructure driving the diffusion MRI signal, leading to better modeling and increased clinical and research utility.","A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain",9836456,F31NS113571,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mus', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurologic', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plant Resins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'absorption', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'electron tomography', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'nanometer', 'nanoscale', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'tractography', 'validation studies']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2019,39994,0.018132307311814526
"Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors Project Summary/Abstract One of the key advances in modern positron emission tomography (PET) systems for clinical imaging is the use of time-of-flight (TOF) information. In cancer imaging TOF provides superior lesion detection and more accurate quantification that is crucial in measuring response to therapy, as well as in neurological and cardiovascular imaging applications. An additional benefit of TOF is the ability to lower the radiation dose or scan time without sacrificing image quality, important for patient safety and comfort. The magnitude of these clinical benefits is determined by the TOF resolution of the PET detectors, therefore the prospect of achieving unprecedented image quality and clinical imaging capabilities with superior TOF resolution has fueled significant research in developing detector technology for TOF-PET systems. However, these developments have been largely unaccompanied by advances in signal processing methods needed to extract TOF information from the detector’s electrical signals, with most detectors making use of crude analog algorithms that discard most of the useful timing information contained in the signals. Now, with the availability of low-cost fast waveform digitizers, there is an exciting opportunity to implement sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to achieve superior TOF resolution. The main advantage of developing advanced signal processing algorithms is that it presents a cost-effective route to improved TOF resolution that is complementary to instrumentation innovations. In essence, the TOF gain comes for free; the detector signals already contain the information needed for better TOF resolution, it just needs to be used effectively. Here we propose to tailor deep learning techniques to estimate TOF from the detector signals. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a powerful approach to learn complex representations of input data that can be used for tasks such as classification and regression. CNNs are therefore very suitable for directly estimating TOF from the detector waveforms, since these waveforms are influenced by several complex and intertwined processes which are hard to accurately model. Furthermore, large amounts of ground truth training data are readily generated. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of CNN-based TOF estimation, and found up to 23% improvement in TOF resolution compared to standard signal processing methods. This proposal aims to optimize these methods to push the limits of achievable TOF resolution and develop methods for their practical implementation. First, we will develop CNN architectures and methods suitable for silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) that are now used in modern TOF-PET systems. We will also optimize the digitizing parameters to make optimal use of CNNs for TOF estimation. Second, we will implement CNN-TOF methods in a modern commercial PET detector, including using a global CNN to simultaneously estimate TOF and the crystal-of-interaction from the detector waveforms, demonstrating the practical feasibility of using this promising deep learning method in next generation PET systems. Narrative The use of time-of-flight information in positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful way to increase clinical imaging capabilities of PET, and is now used in most modern systems. Improving time-of-flight performance promises to provide substantial benefits for lesion detection in cancer imaging, kinetic modeling with dynamic imaging, and the use of lower radiation dose for patient safety. Here we introduce deep learning signal processing methods to significantly improve the performance of time-of-flight PET detectors without requiring new materials, which thereby represents a cost effective route towards maximizing the use of the rich imaging signal provided by time-of-flight.",Deep learning techniques for time-of-flight PET detectors,9651713,R03EB027268,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Dose', 'Electronics', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'analog', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical imaging', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'photomultiplier', 'physical process', 'response', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'time use', 'voltage']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2018,78500,0.03046571995645553
"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The goals of this project are • to improve non-contrast, radiation-free arterial spin label MRI methods  using deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence that has  shown tremendous progress for computer vision • to validate these methods against a CBF gold-standard, oxygen-15 water  PET, using simultaneous PET/MRI, using an adaptive “play-the-winner” strategy • to apply them to assess gender differences in CVR and test their  reproducibility, with the goal of establishing age and gender normative  ranges to better identify outliers.",Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning,9599417,R01EB025220,"['Acetazolamide', 'Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Bypass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Carotid Stenosis', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consensus', 'Cytolysis', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'ImProv', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Japanese Population', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Premenopause', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Spin Labels', 'Stress Tests', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Waste Products', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Xenon', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'cerebrovascular', 'cerebrovascular imaging', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'design', 'direct application', 'disability', 'evidence based guidelines', 'gender difference', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'men', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'response', 'stressor', 'stroke risk', 'systematic review', 'time use', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,653337,-0.0017418485188090132
"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9521289,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,471965,0.04404191759902534
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,9524253,R01CA218187,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,684119,-0.02183236915541039
"MRI near Total Joint replacements Project Abstract Overview: The parent project for this supplement aims to provide routine MRI of subjects with total joint replacements by reducing the severe image artifacts near metal, while offering highly efficient patient-specific scans that can detect bone loss, infection, and temperature changes near the implant in clinically feasible scan times. The supplement aims to incorporate deep learning techniques to better meet the parent grant goals. Relevance: Total joint replacements are one of the most successful orthopedic procedures, used annually to reduce pain from joint diseases in about one million patients in the United States (a number projected to double by 2030). However, about 10% of joint replacements fail in 5-10 years due to bone loss (osteolysis), infection, or other complications, often leading to revision surgery. Accurate, early, non-invasive assessment of complications remains limited, but would offer earlier and less invasive treatments, reduce unnecessary surgery, or allow better surgical planning. Approach: Prior to, and during the parent grant period, we have developed novel “multi-spectral imaging” (MSI) MRI techniques that allow visualization of pathology adjacent to metallic implants, and together with other groups have successfully applied them to imaging of patients with devices including joint replacements and spinal fixation hardware. However these methods remain slow, have limited spatial resolution, and are challenging to use routinely. The recent growth of the machine learning field including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and its application to medical imaging offers unique opportunities to substantially improve MRI near metal, and specifically the goals of the parent grant. We propose 3 small, independent aims in the supplement: (1) to bring fast, isotropic imaging near metal to clinical practice by using CNN-based methods to reduce reconstruction times to under 30 seconds, (2) to improve image quality away from metal by using a new reconstruction and CNN to avoid needing standard imaging in addition to MSI methods and (3) to reduce background-gradient induced artifacts near to metal using a CNN-based approach to enable better diagnosis of abnormalities adjacent to metal. Summary: We aim to supplement our parent grant with CNN-based approaches to speed up scanning and image reconstruction, and to improve image quality near to and way from metal. These techniques will allow routine, non-invasive evaluation for earlier and more accurate detection and treatment of complications in these patients, as well as numerous other applications of MRI near metal implants. Project Narrative There is a growing need for accurate diagnosis of complications surrounding joint arthroplasty, where MRI would provide excellent contrast if not for the fact that the presence of metal severely degrades images. Building on recent ideas in MRI and deep learning, we propose to develop practical methods for routine clinical imaging of patients with metal implants by increasing speed as well as offering image contrast that shows infection and other complications near the metal devices. Ultimately these methods will be tested and offered for widespread use to enable earlier and better treatment of complications resulting from arthroplasty, as well as for better understanding of the implications of different devices.",MRI near Total Joint replacements,9750463,R01EB017739,"['Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Infection', 'Joint repair', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Osteolysis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Stretching', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arthropathies', 'bone loss', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'field study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'pain reduction', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'spectrograph']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,156870,0.030429455381250674
"Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography (PET) is a high-sensitivity molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, with the ability to observe molecular-level activities inside a living body through the injection of specific radioactive tracers. In addition to the commonly used F-18-FDG, new tracers are being constantly developed and investigated to pinpoint specific pathways in various diseases. New PET scanners are also being proposed by exploiting time of flight (TOF) information, enabling depth of interaction capability, and extending the solid angle coverage. To realize the full potential of the new PET tracers and scanners, there is an increasing need for the development of advanced image reconstruction methods. This grant application proposes a new framework for regularized image reconstruction that synergistically integrates deep learning and regularized image reconstruction. The new framework is enabled by the recent advances in machine learning, which provide a tool to digest vast amount information embedded in existing medical images. The proposed method embeds a pre-trained deep neural network in an iterative image reconstruction framework and uses the deep neural network to regularize PET image directly. By training the deep neural network with a large amount of high-quality low-noise PET images, the proposed method can capture complex prior information from existing inter-subject and intra-subject data and thus is expected to substantially outperform the current state-of-the-art regularized image reconstruction method. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop the theoretical framework to synergistically integrate deep learning in regularized image reconstruction for PET and (2) to implement the proposed method and validate its effectiveness using existing animal data. Once the proposed method is validated using existing animal data, we will seek funding to acquire necessary human data for the implementation of the proposed method on clinical PET scanners. Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique widely used in clinic for detecting cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders. This project will develop an innovative image reconstruction method that has potential to improve PET image quality and reduce radiation dose. Its success will improve the accuracy of PET for cancer detection and other diseases.",Synergistic integration of deep learning and regularized image reconstruction for positron emission tomography,9586688,R21EB026668,"['Advanced Development', 'Anatomy', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Radioactive Tracers', 'Rattus', 'Role', 'Solid', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'animal data', 'base', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2018,221250,0.017703685585517104
"Machine learning-based radiation toxicity mitigation in pediatric brain cancer Project Summary Radiation therapy (RT) has a proven record of efficacy in treating many forms of pediatric brain tumors. However, it is associated with long-term side effects due to damage to healthy tissue. This is especially important in the developing brain, where long-term deficits can be seen in the areas of intelligence, attention, memory and psychomotor processing. To mediate these deficits, there has been a push away from whole brain irradiation to more targeted treatment by using dose painting intensity modulated radiation therapy (DP-IMRT). However, in order to use these techniques, more information about how dosing to organs-at-risk (OARs) affects outcomes, including volumetric changes in the brain. Voxel Healthcare LLC (formerly Advanced Medical Systems LLC) is the developer of ClickBrain – an automatic pediatric MR brain segmentation tool that uses cloud-based deep learning (Google TensorFlow) technology for radiology clinical decision support. In Aim 1a, we extend ClickBrain to ClickBrain RT – a system that will combine ClickBrain's pre-treatment brain structure segmentation outputs with radiation planning CTs and MRs to calculate dosing to OARs. ClickBrain RT will also segment longitudinal MRIs (1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years) to track outcomes via volumetric changes. We will use OAR dosing, demographics, tumor type and grade, chemotherapy information, OAR and tumor volumetric measurements to predict tumor and OAR volumetric outcomes. We will adapt our existing version of a multi-time point machine learning technique to do this prediction task. In Aim 1b, a user interface for this cloud computing-based proof-of-concept system will be built to allow the RT planner to import patient information and see changes in predicted longitudinal post-RT OAR and tumor volumes, based on adjusting OAR dosages for a particular patient. Our initial validation (Aim 2) will focus on an existing database of 51 germ cell tumor patients acquired as part of standard of care and previous studies at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. Germ cell tumors have relative uniform size and location and provide an ideal dataset to validate our proof-of-concept system. Our long-term goal for ClickBrain RT is to train the machine learning algorithm to provide optimized recommended OAR dosage ranges based on patient history and tumor information. Our software will allow radiation oncologists to optimize treatment and vastly improve long-term quality of life in pediatric brain tumor survivors. Narrative Mitigating radiation toxicity due to radiation therapy for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors is important to avoid long-term developmental side effects. Our ClickBrain RT software will use cloud computing-based deep learning technologies to automatically delineate key structures in the brain and to train a machine learning algorithm to predict volumetric changes due to treatment-related radiation dosing to these key structures. This will enable physicians to better avoid unnecessary radiation doses that may cause long-term deficits in children with brain tumors.",Machine learning-based radiation toxicity mitigation in pediatric brain cancer,9623177,R43CA233346,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Brain Neoplasm', 'Childhood Malignant Brain Tumor', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cochlea', 'Computer software', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Germ cell tumor', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Height', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Lobe', 'Location', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microtomy', 'Optic Chiasm', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation Toxicity', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiologic Technology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'dosage', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'morphometry', 'multitask', 'negative affect', 'oncology', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"VOXEL HEALTHCARE, LLC",R43,2018,224726,-0.0016930361446219548
"Left Ventricular Distribution Patterns of the Regionally varying Ischemic Myocardial Contractile Substrates Associated with Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation PROJECT SUMMARY - ABSTRACT  The loss of mitral leaflet coaptation surface area caused by restrictive chordal tethering to dysfunctional myocardial wall segments is the well-recognized mechanism of ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR). An accurate characterization of the left ventricular (LV) distribution pattern, magnitude, and reversibility of the contractile injury substrates that predispose to the occurrence of ischemic MR may improve the accuracy of therapeutic intervention. Only recently have high-resolution LV regional contractile metrics become clinically available to map myocardial ischemic substrates (hibernating, infarcted) across patient-specific LV geometry. Application of MRI-based multiparametric strain analysis in our pilot ischemic MR study group suggested that high-resolution 3D topographical mapping of LV contractile injury may reveal a more complex array of associated regional contractile injury than is discernible from echocardiography. This initial study identified a “sentinel” LV region (basilar and mid subregions of the posterior and posterolateral LV regions) in which the presence of severe contractile injury clearly predisposes to the development of ischemic MR.  We will enroll ischemic coronary artery disease patients with (≥3+ MR; n=90) and without (≤1+ MR; n=90) ischemic MR who are scheduled for standardized surgery (ACC/AHA Clinical Guidelines). Preoperative MRI- based multiparametric strain analysis will provide high-resolution 3D LV topographical maps of regional contractile injury to statistically correlate to occurrence of ischemic MR and to postoperative studies obtained at 3-months and yearly. An independent core laboratory will catalogue all echocardiography-based metrics of ischemic MR for inclusion in Support Vector Machine analyses, along with all other identified clinical variables.  MRI-based LV displacement datasets are obtained in <30 minutes using Navigator-gated Spiral Displacement ENcoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE). Patient-specific LV strain fields are calculated using the recently developed Radial Point Interpolation Method (RPIM). Regional contractile function is “normalized” by comparing multiple patient-specific strain metric values (at each of 11,520 LV grid points) to their respective average +/- SD values from our normal human strain database, with z- score (SD) calculation (total computer analysis <20 seconds). Support Vector Machine analyses will search all metric variables (multiparametric strain, echo-based metrics, and all clinical variables) for patterns that predict ischemic MR recurrence.  We will use high-resolution 3D topographical mapping of “normalized” LV contractile function to characterize the distribution, magnitude, and reversibility of the regional contractile injury substrates (hibernating; infarcted) associated with ischemic MR. We will then test the hypothesis that the novel application of machine learning Support Vector Machine analyses can identify hybrid combinations of both regional contractile injury patterns and clinical variables that accurately predict post-repair recurrence of ischemic MR. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Since the loss of mitral leaflet coaptation surface area caused by restrictive chordal tethering to dysfunctional myocardial wall segments is the well-recognized mechanism of ischemic mitral regurgitation, an accurate characterization of the left ventricular distribution pattern, magnitude, and reversibility of the contractile injury substrates (hibernating/infarcted) that predispose to the occurrence of ischemic mitral regurgitation may improve the accuracy of therapeutic intervention. Only recently have high-resolution LV regional contractile metrics become clinically available to map these myocardial ischemic substrates across patient-specific LV geometry. We will test the hypothesis that in patients with ischemic CAD, the ischemic status of a 4-subregion “sentinel” zone (basilar/mid subregions of posterior/posterolateral regions) is the primary determinant of the presence of significant ischemic MR and that three defining ischemic substrate (infarcted, hibernating) characteristics (location, magnitude, and reversibility) can be used in a hybrid model to predict recurrence of ischemic MR.",Left Ventricular Distribution Patterns of the Regionally varying Ischemic Myocardial Contractile Substrates Associated with Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation,9769299,R56HL136619,"['Angiography', 'Anterolateral', 'Area', 'Cardiac', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Geometry', 'Guidelines', 'Hibernation', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Postoperative Period', 'Radial', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Schedule', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Troponin', 'Ventricular', 'base', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'papillary muscle', 'prognostic', 'repaired', 'response']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R56,2018,389375,0.0027549249304648486
"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement.

"30th Annual MR Angiography Meeting Project Summary The objective of the 30th Annual Workshop on Magnetic Resonance Angiography is to provide a forum for scientists and scientist-clinicians, clinical staff and industry interested in MR angiography techniques. The Workshop is the annual meeting of the Society for Magnetic Resonance Angiography (SMRA). At this meeting, emerging techniques and exciting new applications to visualize the vascular system, measure and display blood flow and improve patient outcomes will be presented. MR angiography is an important clinical tool that is applied to millions of patients annually and accounts for an estimated 10% of all MR procedures. Recent advances in time-resolved imaging, non-contrast imaging, post-processing techniques, flow measurements, and flow visualization, as well other innovations, continue to make MRA a dynamic, cutting-edge area of interest for scientific investigation. A major goal of this SMRA Workshop is to provide scientists, clinicians, and students with the opportunity to build connections, pool their knowledge, and educate each other in order to accelerate the refinement of MRA technology and critically how to apply it in clinical practice. Topics for the MRA Workshop will include: vascular disease mechanisms, vessel wall and plaque imaging, quantification of blood flow dynamics, machine learning including deep learning plus `Big Data', vessel lumen imaging, MRA of the brain, heart, abdomen, and extremities; contrast agents, cardiac MR, assessment of cardiac structure & function, clinical study design, new MRA techniques, interventional MRI, MRI of implanted devices, technology assessment, and comparing MRI with other medical imaging modalities. The 3-day workshop will be preceded by an informative one-day educational program that will include both fundamental and advanced lectures from international experts in the field. These topics and educational objectives of the 30th Annual Workshop on Magnetic Resonance Angiography are directly related to the NHLBI mission to provide global leadership for research, training, and education to promote the prevention and treatment of heart and blood diseases. The scientific presentations will include new discoveries about the causes of disease and as such contribute to the translation of basic discoveries into clinical practice. In addition, the proposed educational activities as well as discussion among participants will foster training and mentoring of emerging scientists and physicians. In this context, the workshop will support a collaborative research infrastructure, including participants from academic institutions and industry.

"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease.

"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9659850,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,593526,0.000444859548151641
"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9587091,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,185264,-0.01567833379277858
"Predicting contrast enhancement in multiple sclerosis with real time texture analysis Description: Identification of active lesions is critical for the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Currently this identification is based on post-contrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, there are safety concerns with repeated administration of gadolinium –based contrast agents (GBCAs). Thus, there is critical need for identifying active lesions without the use of GBCA. In this application we propose to identify the active lesions without administering GBCA using texture analysis (TA) using multi- modal non-contrast MRI and support vector machine (SVM) learning. A unique feature of this proposal is that the results will be analyzed using MRI data acquired on a large cohort of MS patients (~1000) as a part of phase III, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial (CombiRx). In addition texture features will be identified that can predict lesions that convert into tissue destructive lesions, so called black holes. This has important clinical implications since there is correlative evidence that balk holes are associated with clinical disability. A novelty of this project lies in performing texture analysis in real time that allows the physician to make the decision about administering GBCA on the spot while the patient is still in the scanner. This greatly helps in eliminating and/or minimizing the number of times GBCA needs to be administered. For real time analysis, the necessary infrastructure that includes automatic processing pipeline and integration of the MRI scanner with high performance computational resources located at Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) in Austin. Finally to establish real time TA as a viable alternative to GBCA administration for identifying active lesions, the developed methods will be prospectively applied to MS patients undergoing MRI scans as a part of routine clinical management. Public health relevance: Gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) are routinely used for identifying active lesions in multiple sclerosis patients. However, there are safety concerns with repeated administration of GBCA. This proposal uses novel real time analysis for identifying lesions that are likely to enhance on pre- contrast MRI. Considering the large number of MS patients who are frequently scanned with GBCA, this proposal has a high degree of clinical relevance.",Predicting contrast enhancement in multiple sclerosis with real time texture analysis,9650821,R56NS105857,"['Advanced Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Evaluation', 'Gadolinium', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neuraxis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protons', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Spottings', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'attenuation', 'austin', 'base', 'black hole', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'contrast enhanced', 'density', 'disability', 'high end computer', 'imaging facilities', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'prospective', 'public health relevance']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R56,2018,535749,-0.05145039516108607
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9640372,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,347584,0.020772473631538193
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9444495,F30CA206291,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,49524,0.0468110667434005
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research.

"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Distinguishing Lipid Subtypes by Amplifying Contrast from J-Coupling Project Summary/Abstract With the global rise in obesity-related diseases and increasing recognition of the role of fat in diseases such as fatty liver, there is growing need for a noninvasive chemical assay of in vivo lipid depots. But the rich chemistry of these molecules is often ignored in MRI, which typically treats fat as a homogeneous proton species because differences in chemical shift and relaxation are difficult to distinguish in a clinical setting. Innovation: This proposal will be the first to use nonuniform echo spacing to generate J-coupling based contrast between chemically different fats. While fat spins often give monotonically decaying signal under a uniformly spaced spin echo train, J-coupling causes nonuniformly spaced spin echo trains to generate complex fingerprints, which distinguish and even quantify fats with otherwise similar MR properties. Significance: The immediate clinical impact will be to demonstrate a novel J-coupling based contrast mechanism in vivo which will contribute to a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish the 25% of the population with benign steatosis from the 2-3% with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The broader significance of this work is that this novel contrast mechanism could revolutionize the study and clinical management of many diseases associated with bioactive lipid subtypes. Approach: The aims are designed to test the hypothesis that nonuniform echo trains (1) can create contrast between different fats, which (2) will contribute to a multiparametric noninvasive protocol to distinguish benign steatosis and NASH. Aim 1 will identify the echo spacing best suited for distinguishing benign steatosis and NASH, first using density matrix simulations based on high resolution spectra of liver fat from animals with each disease, and then using experiments on whole rat livers. In Aim 2, the sequence developed in Aim 1 will be tested in humans with biopsy proven benign steatosis or NASH, along with a suite of standard methods of liver and fat characterization. This metric, and also metrics derived from conventional images, will be tested for the ability to separate these patient groups. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be used to find a metric that combines multiecho intensities with standard MR metrics. This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains as a new contrast mechanism and yield a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis and NASH. Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes. The results of this work will justify a larger scale study to properly validate the sensitivity to different fat species in humans. Project Narrative This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains both as a new J-coupling based contrast mechanism and as part of a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis (~25% of the population) from patients on the NASHfibrosiscirrhosis trajectory of metabolically induced liver disease (2- 3% of the population). Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes.

"New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging Project Summary To more fully exploit the basic science of mechanobiology as it pertains to breast cancer progression, the medical imaging field continues to search for fast, safe, and effective elasticity imaging methods. In this project we propose a fundamentally new approach to ultrasonic elasticity imaging in which the weak forces applied to patient tissues and the measured displacements that result are used to train a numerical model specifically for that patient. This constitutive model is developed using finite-element methods and neural networks assembled in a unique configuration called the AutoProgressive (AutoP) Method. AutoP “learns” complete stress and strain properties directly from sparse force and displacement measurements and without a mathematical model. Using quasi-static stimuli, AutoP exploits the fact that each force-displacement estimate contains information about mechanical properties at all locations in the contiguous tissue. From measurement information and conservation laws, AutoP generates an informational model without the need to make assumptions about tissue linearity, isotropy, or other material properties normally required when constructing images that display tissue mechanical properties. Once an accurate material-property model is formed by AutoP, we adopt a separate rheological model (e.g., Kelvin Voigt) to form viscoelastic parameters for image display. The AutoP method employs beamformed RF-echo acquisitions from which point displacements are estimated, applied compressional force sensed at the transducer surface, and tissue shape.  No other imaging method is capable of estimating all relevant stress fields, which gives AutoP unique capabilities. AutoP estimates the mechanical properties that one strives to obtain from an inverse problem approach, but AutoP is not a mathematical inverse technique and hence does not suffer from nonunique solutions. Without the need to assume material properties, AutoP can (in principle) model tissue properties in three dimensions and in time following large deformations in highly-nonlinear, anisotropic media. This R21 proposal focuses on establishing the feasibility of the AutoP methodology for subsequent clinical trials under future funding. At the completion of this two-year project, we will demonstrate a new tool for medical imaging capable of exploring the mechanical properties of tissues over a very broad range of deformations. We specifically target ultrasonic methods and quasi-static force stimuli in this project. However AutoP could eventually be coupled to other imaging modalities (e.g., MRE, OCE) or dynamic force-stimulus methods.  The scientific premise underlying AutoP is that we already record all of the information needed to generate a very broad range of elasticity images. The key to unlocking this information is to set aside mathematical models in favor of data-driven informational models built using the unique machine learning abilities of the AutoP method. If successful, AutoP will have a major influence on medical elasticity imaging methods. Project Narrative: A new type of machine-learning method is proposed for elasticity imaging of patient tissues that offers the potential to minimize many current limitations. If we are successful in this development, ultrasonic elasticity imaging would significantly improve in its ability to accurately represent mechanical properties of breast tissues, without any changes in current instrumentation and without increasing cost to the healthcare system or adding risk to patients.",New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging,9560761,R21EB023402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Isotropy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modulus', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Writing', 'aged', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'breast imaging', 'cost', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'imaging properties', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical properties', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel strategies', 'object shape', 'processing speed', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'viscoelasticity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2018,179876,0.0057169672738006825

We believe the GRC format placed in the context of a small-college venue promotes the type of innovative interdisciplinary thinking that leads to breakthroughs. An environment where leading senior scientists debate core issues is valuable to young investigators trying to build successful independent careers in medical imaging in industry and academia. All attendees are invited to present a poster describing their research in poster sessions that are a key element of the Gordon Conference format. The June 17-22, 2018 GRC conference theme is “Image Science: Creating Knowledge from Information,” which is focused on appropriate acquisition and efficient uses of the massive volume of imaging information now collected from patients. Speakers give 40 minutes presentations in a single-track format with 20 minute discussions following each presentation that are led by experts in the field. Topic range from “Imaging in Brain Science Discovery” to “Advanced Machine Learning” and “Computational Imaging.” At the center of each presentation is a discussion of the core challenges shared by image scientists and novel techniques for acquiring and displaying information in a manner that maximizes decision performance. Given the success of the previous meeting, we will hold the first-ever, student-run Gordon Research Seminars (GRS) on Image Science June 16, 17, 2018. Our aim is to build Image Science as an independent field of study through detailed interdisciplinary discussions and by fostering the success of a new generation of image scientists. Project Narrative: Solutions to very difficult problems often emerge from discussions among experts in different fields of study being challenged by the same core problems. The 2018 GRC on Imaging Science strives to build a community of problem solvers by creating an environment for detailed discussions among senior investigators that involves young investigators at a time when they are building careers. This is a proposal to fund young investigators to attend the conference.",2018 Image Science Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar,9461211,R13EB025662,"['Academia', 'Area', 'Astronomy', 'Big Data', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Discipline', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fees', 'Female', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Risk-Taking', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Senior Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'career', 'college', 'cost', 'design', 'disabled students', 'educational atmosphere', 'field study', 'frontier', 'graduate student', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging scientist', 'imaging system', 'information display', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'meetings', 'minority student', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'novel', 'posters', 'preference', 'remote sensing', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'training opportunity', 'virtual', 'willingness']",NIBIB,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,10000,0.01600841890292518
"2018 International Molecular and Functional Pulmonary Imaging Workshop SUMMARY This application requests funding to support the 2018 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging, a three- day meeting scheduled for December 6-8, 2018, which will be the sixth of its kind hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. The requested funds will primarily be used to cover travel and housing expenses for undergraduate, graduate and junior faculty speakers. Some may also be used to support live webcasting and publication of the workshop proceedings. As in the past, it is our intention to broadcast each session of the meeting online in real-time, enabling interested parties who cannot physically attend to access them free of charge. Pulmonary diseases constitute a significant and rising cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and imaging is becoming an increasingly important source of innovative techniques for both diagnosing and treating these pathologies. The field of pulmonary imaging currently encompasses a wider range of techniques for the functional, structural and molecular assessment of lung disorders than ever before, which are being developed and refined by investigators across a diverse set of fields such as biology, physics, chemistry, medicine and engineering, computer science and machine learning. Given the rapidly-developing nature of the pulmonary imaging field, it is of the utmost importance that a regular forum exists for scientists and clinicians to communicate and debate their ideas with one another. In the absence of other meetings with a similar focus, our previous workshops have provided such a forum, bringing together the diverse components of the field into the kind of rigorous, focused exchange needed to advance the field. The specific aims of the proposed workshop are as follows: (1) keep the pulmonary imaging community informed about the latest developments in structural, functional and molecular lung imaging; (2) examine the use of pulmonary imaging to assess therapeutic response, including strategies for overcoming the challenges inherent in this objective; (3) explore the integration of machine learning with pulmonary imaging techniques to more accurately phenotype disease and predict injury progression; (4) broadcast the entire proceedings live over the web, allowing non-attendees to freely access the proceedings, and enabling the online audience to participate in workshop discussions in real-time. Based on feedback from participants that previous meetings tended to be overly dense and predominantly didactic in nature, we have also implemented a significant format change for proposed 2018 meeting. With the exception of a few keynote presentations, we plan to limit the percentage of formal lecture in each invited speaker’s talk to one-third of their allotted time, with the rest dedicated to a period of discussion that will be driven by a panel of moderators as well as audience questions. For each presentation, the moderators will prepare a list of questions focusing on three main points: 1) the translatability of the research being presented, 2) the scientific gap which this research aims to address, and 3) the necessity of identifying lung disorders that are suitable for longitudinal studies, as well as which imaging parameters are best suited to the longitudinal study of lung disease. In addition to this change in format, the 2018 workshop will continue efforts to strike a more even balance between functional, structural and molecular imaging approaches to pulmonary disease. Finally, we will also continue to foreground the important issue of using imaging techniques to assess treatment response, which was first introduced at the 2017 pulmonary imaging workshop. NARRATIVE This application requests funding to support the 2018 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging at the University of Pennsylvania. The proposed meeting will provide a valuable opportunity for researchers engaged in the development of functional, structural, and molecular imaging techniques for assessing lung diseases—such as COPD, ARDS, IPF and lung cancer—to meet and discuss their work with one another. The entirety of the workshop will be broadcast live online, giving interested individuals who are not able to attend in person the ability to both view and participate in its proceedings.",2018 International Molecular and Functional Pulmonary Imaging Workshop,9613494,R13HL144010,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Heart', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intention', 'International', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Protons', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Pulmonology', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lectures', 'lung imaging', 'meetings', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'patient response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'treatment response', 'undergraduate student']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R13,2018,29805,-0.0387139203792387
"A TOF, DOI, MRI compatible PET detector to support sub-millimeter neuroPET imaging Abstract The overall goal of this research is to develop next generation positron emission tomography (PET) detector technology to support non-invasive, quantitative brain imaging at spatial and temporal resolutions currently not achievable with human neuro-PET systems. The developed PET detector technology will also be compatible with operation in an MRI system. The proposed research is targeted to the NIH Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative. Human brain imaging with PET/MRI will be an essential tool in neuroscience studies to ""Develop innovative technologies to understand the human brain and treat its disorders; create and support integrated brain research networks."" The key advancement that we introduce is a PET detector with <100 psec time-of-flight (TOF) PET coincidence resolution, <2 mm continuous depth of interaction (DOI) positioning and intrinsic detector spatial resolution to support <1 mm PET image resolution throughout the system imaging field of view (FOV). Detector modules have been designed that individually achieve these performance metrics; however, no detector module has been designed that supports all of them. To make disruptive advancements in neuro-imaging using PET, one must push the image spatial resolution (i.e., currently 2-3 mm image resolution) as well as coincidence timing resolution and also be MRI compatible. The impact of this project is that we will advance the state of the art in all of these critical performance areas. We will achieve these goals by first understanding the role that different PET detector performance parameters have on task-based figures of merit for neuroPET imaging. We will investigate how both TOF and image resolution impact figure of merit performance for estimation, detection and characterization imaging tasks. Monte Carlo simulation will be used along with both object-based (i.e., mathematical) and anthropomorphic digital phantoms. Next we will optimize SiPM device selection, electronics and detector geometry for <100 psec TOF coincidence timing, 1 mm intrinsic spatial resolution and <2 mm DOI positioning resolution. We will build and characterize a prototype PET detector module utilizing a novel dual- sided slat crystal detector design. To advance coincidence timing performance we will investigate the use of machine learning to estimate the arrival time of detected events. Finally, we will optimize the detector design for MRI compatibility. We will fully test and characterize performance of our prototype detector on the benchtop and in a MRI scanner while running clinical MRI pulse sequences. At the end of this developmental project we will be in position to build a state of the art, MRI compatible, TOF, DOI PET imaging system. Narrative The overall goal of this work is to develop detector imaging technology that will enable new research into the development, function and aging of the human brain. This technology will allow functional imaging of the brain at higher spatial resolution and higher coincidence timing resolution than previously achieved and also facilitate simultaneous multi-modality imaging (i.e., PET/MRI) at these new levels of performance.","A TOF, DOI, MRI compatible PET detector to support sub-millimeter neuroPET imaging",9616697,R01EB026964,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Side', 'Silicon', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging detector', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'operation', 'prototype', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,29442,0.05001446068403312
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue. Patient care and clinical decision-making will improve dramatically as a complete picture of histological features underlying brain tumor imaging emerges from this proposal.",Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology,9502939,R01CA218144,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain Glioblastoma', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computational algorithm', 'Contrast Media', 'Cytology', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Gadolinium', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Inter-tumoral heterogeneity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Expectancy', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Oncologist', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radio', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress Tests', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Wisconsin', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical decision-making', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R01,2018,352275,0.055847624321371525
"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9567622,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,659674,0.005521664212073711
"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,9570304,U01HL142518,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Rupture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Thoracic aorta', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tunica Adventitia', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Video Microscopy', 'Work', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intracranial artery', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mucoid', 'multi-scale modeling', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,528639,0.013735169229932792
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE MODELING FOR BRAIN TUMOR ANALYSIS AND TRACKING MRI images have been used for a wide variety of medical applications for a long time because they are safe and highly sensitive at detecting of tissue abnormalities that indicate cancer. MRI is generated by measuring the response of tissue components to a magnetic field. Also, based on the published statistics, brain tumor is one of the most common causes of death and early detection and monitoring is crucial for treatment. Literature and market review suggests that although extensive research exists on brain tumor detection using MRI images, MRI–based systems designed for brain tumor detection that have ultimate clinical value and use are lacking. Accordingly, we propose a new software technology that effectively detect, segment, classify and monitor brain tumor in MRI images. There have been extensive efforts on brain tumor detection in MR images because early detection has been always crucial for success of treatment. For ongoing work in our parent RO1 grant we are developing new machine learning and image analysis methods that for automatic detection and segmentation of brain tumor in MRI images, which is expected to help patients to have a much better chance of successful treatment.

"Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment Supplement Title: Deep learning-based methods for PET image reconstruction and segmentation to enhance radionuclide therapy dosimetry Abstract There is much recent interest in quantitative imaging of yttrium-90 (Y-90) for dosimetry because of the promise of novel Y-90 labelled radionuclide therapies. Deep learning methods are well suited for addressing the challenges of Y-90 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, where compared with diagnostic FDG PET, true coincidence count-rates are very low while random coincidences are high. The potential of deep learning-based algorithms to outperform conventional algorithms in medical imaging is well recognized, however research in applying these methods to nuclear medicine imaging modalities such as PET is very limited. The few studies applying deep learning to PET imaging have been mostly limited to post-reconstruction image processing/analysis for denoising and feature extraction, and not in the image formation/reconstruction process. Additionally, deep learning research in PET thus far have focused on improving diagnostic imaging, not quantitative imaging, which together with accurate lesion/organ segmentation are pre-requisite for accurate dosimetry. In this supplement, we propose to develop and evaluate deep learning-based image reconstruction and lesion/organ segmentation for low count PET applications such as Y-90 PET. Our approach starts with the raw projection data and utilizes a deep recurrent network in the image formation process. Because the two tasks are mutually dependent, our formalism takes the novel approach of joint reconstruction-segmentation with multi-modality (PET/CT) data. Specifically, we will 1) develop and evaluate Y-90 PET image reconstruction with a deep recurrent network for the regularizer, 2) develop and evaluate deep-learning based joint PET segmentation-reconstruction using multi- modal 90Y PET/CT data. To train/validate/test the proposed methods, we will use clinically realistic phantom measurements and simulations as well as leverage on existing patient data from the parent grant where thus far, PET data and radiologist defined morphologic liver/lesion contours for over 50 cases and 150 lesions are available. We will compare the new Y-90 PET reconstruction with the formulation we recently developed under the parent grant (using conventional untrained regularizers) that showed promising results but suffered from resolution- noise tradeoff. The expected outcome of this work is a well validated deep learning reconstruction- segmentation framework for challenging PET imaging applications where conventional methods are suboptimal. The proposed research is expected to result in new and accurate tools for quantitative image reconstruction and lesion/organ segmentation that have the potential to contribute significantly toward improving dosimetry in internal radionuclide therapy such as Yttrium- 90 radioembolization in liver malignancies. This study is relevant to public health because a dosimetry-guided personalized approach to radionuclide therapy is highly likely to substantially improve patient outcomes compared to current standard practice. !",Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment,9750430,R01EB022075,"['90Y', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Formulation', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radioembolization', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'dosimetry', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parent grant', 'personalized approach', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,102093,0.020513770107359677
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors Abstract Solid tumors are comprise the large majority of cancers (>90%). Standard of diagnosis and care often involved serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors. The long-term goal of this project is to provide computation tools for understanding the histopathologic variation of solid tumors and aid the development of image guided therapies for individualizing solid tumor treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging and that they can contribute towards the development of adaptive radiation therapy (ART). Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the development of fast and accurate computational tools for using MR image guided radiation therapy in clinical settings. Project Narrative The proposal aims to advance our current understanding of the association of malignant solid tumors at the cellular level. We plan to develop fast computational tools for real time image guided radiation, personalized to individual variations in cancer patients. Overall, this will help improve cancer diagnosis and treatment by better differentiation between healthy and aggressive cancer tissue, and by improved precision for targeted therapy.",Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors,9603869,R21CA231892,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image guided therapy', 'image-guided radiation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'individual variation', 'individualized medicine', 'member', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel architecture', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive tools', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2018,167475,0.024970975086506544
"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence. Therefore, it will pave the way for more refined and targeted treatments of peritumoral brain tissue, which is where most tumor recurrence occurs.",Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin,9503788,R01NS042645,"['Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infiltration', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population trends', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'brain tissue', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'molecular subtypes', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,528526,0.05322707496731564
"In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech Project Summary Tongue cancer and the treatments used to cure the disease such as glossectomy can have debilitating effects on speech and swallowing, yet not much is known about the relationship between tongue movements in speech and reconstruction choices after cancer resection. The tongue’s vital role in speaking and swallowing is executed by a uniquely complex array of muscles which deform locally into functional units. Tongue movements are governed by synergistic activation of these functional units using orthogonally oriented muscle fibers not a rigid skeletal structure. Functional units, which are regions of 3D coherent motion, are the structures that link low-level muscle activity to high-level surface tongue geometry. This link, the organization of functional units, can provide considerable insight into normal motor control and adapted tongue motion, as in patients who have had surgery for tongue cancer. However, there is poor understanding of the details of how muscle morphology contributes to function due to tongue muscle interdigitation and complex local activation. A key to understanding the relationship between the structure and function of the tongue is to identify functional units of motion in localized tongue regions and map them to muscle anatomy. A large step in this direction can be gained by developing a tool to cluster 3D coherent motion patterns from tagged MRI, and register them to muscle anatomy from high-resolution MRI. Speech motor control is a critical area of importance where platform tools for machine learning techniques are lacking. The goal of this project is to create a framework to relate the functional units to tongue muscle anatomy. This framework will enhance tongue motion analysis in medical research and clinical applications, where MRI is frequently used. To address this goal, we have already developed technologies to analyze high-resolution and tagged-MRI. The first is a detailed 3D muscle atlas based on 3D high-resolution MRI, which depicts the locations of both extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, and will be registered to each speaker to identify and track their muscles in the 3D tagged data sets. The second is software to derive 3D displacement and strain fields from tagged MR images. These displacements, strains, and derived quantities will be used to extract spatio-temporal feature vectors that define coherent regions, which will be verified with simulation. The vectors will then be input into a novel computational method using a NMF and clustering, the goal of which is to establish the functional units of speech. In addition, biomechanical simulations will be used to co-validate our findings. The concept of functional units is at the core of the proposed work, as it can provide insights into tongue muscle coordination in patients after glossectomy surgery. The research plan comprises two specific aims: (1) develop a computational method to establish functional units from MRI and (2) determine the relationship between alterations in anatomy and alterations in functional unit motion after tongue cancer treatment. Linking the functional units to the anatomy will allow the design of more focused treatments and therapies for tongue motion-related disorders. Project Narrative Functions of the tongue—speaking, eating, and breathing—are executed by using a complex muscular array to create global motions (synergies) by deforming local functional units which are intermediate structures that link muscle activity to surface tongue geometry. This project will develop new computational tools that will enable researchers and clinicians to determine the functional units of specific motions and relate them to the muscle anatomy. Such a breakthrough will dramatically improve our knowledge of the mechanisms of muscle coordination, thereby permitting improvement of diagnosis and treatment of tongue motion-related disorders.",In Vivo Mapping of Uncharted Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech,9452335,R21DC016047,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Bone structure', 'Breathing', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Elements', 'Excision', 'Geometry', 'Gestures', 'Glossectomy', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Fibers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Treatment-Related Cancer', 'Unit of Measure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'digital', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malignant tongue neoplasm', 'motor control', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'reconstruction', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2018,249441,-0.05282548995538256
"2018 In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar PROJECT SUMMARY  The field of magnetic resonance (MR) is in the midst of a revolution. Disruptive external forces, such as the advent of powerful new Artificial Intelligence methods, coupled with a recent creative ferment in method development within the field, is changing the way we think about the acquisition, the reconstruction, and the interpretation of MR data. Meanwhile, MR has long been an indispensable tool not only for basic discovery but also for medical diagnostics, but the value proposition of clinical MR imaging is also changing, against the backdrop of a shifting healthcare landscape.  There is a palpable need to explore the full scope of these changes, in a forum that enables deep dives and focused discussion, without losing the necessary breath of perspective. While large meetings such as the annual scientific meeting of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) have the necessary breath, the sheer size and pace of such meetings work against the requisite focus. On the other hand, short focused workshops are better suited to the evaluation of progress in well-defined subfields.  The goal of this grant application is to support a high-impact conference with a time-tested format which is ideally suited to assess recent changes in the field of in vivo MR. The tenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance will be held July 15 to 20, 2018, at Proctor Academy, in Andover, NH. Our GRC will also be associated with the first-ever trainee-organized and trainee-focused Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance, which will take place on the weekend before the GRC (July 14-15, 2018). The trainee seminar meshes well with our goal of preparing young scientists for a changing field and a changing world. We request funding to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows attending these meetings, which will focus explicitly on the shifting role of MR in a rapidly changing world.  The GRC, subtitled “Challenging assumptions about MR technology and applications in a changing world,” will be led by Chair Daniel K. Sodickson, MD, PhD, and Vice Chair Jeff F. Dunn, PhD, and will build upon a rich history of In Vivo MR GRCs. The GRS, subtitled “The Changing World of Magnetic Resonance: Old Physics, New Techniques,” will be led by Chair Scott Beeman, PhD, and Vice Chair Carson Hoffman, BSc, and will further enhance the experience of trainees with tailored opportunities for mentorship, networking, and scientific exchange.  Specific aims of our 2018 GRC and GRS on In Vivo MR are as follows:  1. Explore disruptive forces and marshal disruptive innovation in the field of in vivo MR  2. Foster connections between MR and surrounding disciplines  3. Prepare young scientists to make a difference in a rapidly changing world PROJECT NARRATIVE Support is requested for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the tenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance, scheduled for July 15-20, 2018, and the inaugural trainee- focused Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) to precede the conference on July 14-15, 2018. The GRC will be focused on “Challenging assumptions about MR technology and applications in a changing world,” with the goal of taking the measure of disruptive forces such as Artificial Intelligence, and marshaling disruptive innovations in the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of MR data. The companion GRS will have a related focus on “The changing world of magnetic resonance: old physics, new techniques,” and will provide trainees (who will attend the GRC as well) with opportunities for presentation of their work to peers and thought leaders, discussion of emerging areas of MR, and focused networking and mentorship.",2018 In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar,9608839,R13EB026933,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Anniversary', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Books', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Palpable', 'Physics', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'c new', 'commune', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'meetings', 'method development', 'peer', 'posters', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIBIB,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,5000,0.005891190760643438
"MDCT Quantification of hepatic tumor viability for assessment of cancer therapy Project Summary / Abstract Tumor imaging quantification is critical for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is the clinical imaging modality commonly used for patients diagnosed with hepatic malignancy because of its relatively low cost and wide availability. Conventional tumor quantification using either linear or volumetric measurement has demonstrated significant limitations in the evaluation of malignant liver tumors such as for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when being treated with targeted antiangiogenic therapies or locoregional therapies because changes in overall tumor size do not necessarily reflect tumor response to therapy. This leads to an unmet clinical demand to develop a functional tumor quantification biomarker for effective and accurate assessment of treatment response for liver cancer patients. The goal of this STTR project is to expand development of our functional tumor quantitative imaging biomarker (QIB), named hepatic tumor viability (HTV), for automated quantification of tumor viability of HCC using contrast-enhanced multi-phase hepatic MDCT images. The proposed HTV tool will be built upon existing technologies for quantitative imaging analysis of liver and liver tumors developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using the MDCT datasets of 400 patients with advanced HCC treated with antiangiogenic therapies and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of HTV biomarker: We will continue to enhance the HTV biomarker developed in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy of HCC tumor segmentation using machine-learning classifiers, and to expand the four-phase MDCT imaging protocol developed in Phase I to include that of three-phase MDCT by omitting pre-contrast imaging for flexible adoption in clinical practice, (2) Evaluation of HTV biomarker: We will integrate the HTV biomarker into our 3DQI platform to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and clinical performance of the proposed HTV biomarker in the assessment of treatment response by assessing 400 advanced HCC cases treated with antiangiogenic and TACE therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center, and (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for 3DQI/Liver to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission. This aim is important for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of advanced QIBs developed on the 3DQI/Liver platform for tumor monitoring and response assessment of varied hepatic diseases on both CT and MR images. The successful development and validation of the proposed HTV biomarker will have a high clinical impact by providing a more effective and accurate tumor quantification tool compared to conventional size-based methods for reliable assessment of tumor progression and evaluation of treatment response for patients with HCC. Project Narrative Tumor imaging quantification is indispensable for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is often the modality used because of its relatively low cost and wide availability.

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9564081,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2018,929069,0.04375482679544129
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9515521,R01HL115828,"['4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data archive', 'data sharing', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'sex', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,704597,0.02284912762585804
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9666652,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,192564,0.007655652363801158
"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9525301,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Privatization', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,593292,0.015208289015528108
"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9440279,R01CA197000,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Burden', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Image', 'In complete remission', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Property', 'Registries', 'Residual Cancers', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'computerized tools', 'experimental arm', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'secondary endpoint', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,449175,0.049247591432158004
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9525436,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'efficacy testing', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'preclinical efficacy', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2018,541146,-0.0073591010852733256
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9523248,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'forest', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,634276,-0.006103597702349865
"Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer The goal of this research is to clinically translate software tools we developed through the Quantitative Imaging Network and validate their ability to assess the response of cancer in clinical trials. Current RECIST response criteria are inadequate to detect tumor changes in targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapies, two of the most promising avenues for drug discovery. We hypothesize that innovative volumetric and radiomics signatures of response and progression, identified using our quantitative CT imaging tools, can be integrated into clinical trial workflow to meet the urgent need for alternatives to RECIST criteria. Two large multi-site trials present a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in one disease treated with multiple therapeutic options driven by tissue biomarkers. S0819 is a completed Phase III trial with 1300+ patients and Lung- MAP (S1400) is an ongoing first-of-its-kind Phase II/III model projected to enroll up to 5,000 patients using a multi-drug, targeted screening approach to match patients with sub-studies testing investigational treatments based on their unique tumor profiles. Aim 1 tests whether change in tumor volume over time, measured by our advanced volumetric segmentation algorithms, outperforms unidimensional RECIST 1.1 response criteria. Aim 2 correlates genomic mutations identified in S0819 and Lung-MAP with radiomics signatures constructed by our machine learning models, with the goal of developing a non-invasive, easily repeatable virtual biopsy through CT imaging. Aim 3 validates the prediction of clinical outcomes using early biomarkers of response and progression based on quantitative CT-based radiomic features, hypothesized to outperform both RECIST and volumetrics alone across therapeutic options including chemotherapies, targeted molecular agents, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our work has substantial health significance because validation of volume and radiomic changes as early biomarkers of response or progression will guide clinical trials for drug discovery and help match patients to personalized treatment. Response criteria developed through this study will be widely applicable to clinical practice because CT is the most common cancer imaging modality and the quantitative image analysis tools can easily be incorporated into existing popular imaging platforms and clinical workflow, reducing the time required by radiologists. Data from this project, including anonymized imaging data (CT for all patients and PET for a large subset), clinical meta- data, and lesion mark-ups by independent radiologists, will be shared for use by other researchers through the TCGA Cancer Imaging Archive, continuing an extensive history of data sharing by this team. This work will improve drug discovery for promising new classes of therapies by creating innovative response criteria based on volumetric and radiomics signatures developed with prior support by the QIN and now validated in two large multi-site clinical trials studying multiple therapeutic options in the most important histologic types of lung cancer and most commonly used imaging modality, CT. Results are expected to be applied to other tumor types and help match patients to the treatment that works best for them.","Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer",9482506,U01CA225431,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carboplatin', 'Cetuximab', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunotherapy', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paclitaxel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'drug discovery', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'genomic signature', 'image archival system', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'mutant', 'mutational status', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic value', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2018,644727,-0.04645130340442586
"Quantifiable Thermal Therapy Using Magnetic Resonance Thermometry Imaging Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, and is characterized with dismal odds due to advanced disease at late stage diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate ranges from 7% for patients with non-resectable disease (~80% of patients), to ~23% for patients with resectable tumors (< 20%of patients). PDAC, like most solid tumors, is highly hypoxic, resulting from both poor oxygen delivery due to leaky and chaotic vasculature and increased oxygen consumption due to high metabolic activity. This makes drug delivery to the tumor microenvironment more difficult and often ineffective. In the past 40 years, only marginal improvements in complete response (CR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QoL) have occurred despite the development of a number of promising chemotherapy, or chemoradiation regimens. New and improved therapeutic options are urgently needed to improve the treatment of this disease. Mild hyperthermia (HT) in the range of 39-42°C has shown to improve blood flow to tumors, enhancing the delivery of therapeutics to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Numerous randomized clinical trials have shown to provide CR, PFS, OR and QoL benefits but implementation in clinical practice has been lagging due to the inability to provide safe, quantifiable and controlled therapeutic thermal dose through accurate temperature monitoring. NTO has designed and built the VectronTTx device which can effectively deliver heat non-invasively in deep tissue without causing skin burns or excessive fat heating (the most common adverse effect encountered with current technologies) without the need for a cooling mechanism such as a water bolus that is a frequent cause for interrupted treatments due to patient discomfort. The heating elements of the device are integrated into an applicator with magnetic resonance (MR) transmit and receive channels to allow for real-time MR thermometry imaging (MRTI) measurements. In this Phase I proposal, we will develop novel MRTI methodologies that significantly improve the state-of-the-art by accurately measuring temperature over HT treatment time scales (30-60 minutes) in an abdominal environment compensating for interfering processes including field drift and motion-induced field variations. We will also develop a treatment- modeling architecture that combines virtual models, patient-specific features, and an artificial intelligence (AI)- based architecture to create extrapolated patient-specific treatment plans. Upon successful completion of Phase I and validation of the developed real-time MRTI monitoring techniques, we will develop methods in Phase II for accurate measurements of temperature in fat by incorporating interleaved or hybrid fat-based techniques into the field-corrected MRTI sequences. In phase II, we will also develop and implement the infrastructure to perform personalized treatment planning. This treatment planning will be based on conventional image transformations, conventional EM-solving, and AI learning of thermal sink and tissue properties. Numerous clinical trials have shown that mild hyperthermia in conjunction with chemotherapy or radiation therapy is a promising strategy to treat cancer. However, adoption in the clinic will require the ability to measure temperature in the heated regions both for safety and to verify tumor heating. NeoTherma Oncology (NTO) has developed a device that can heat tumors non-invasively within a Magnetic Resonance scanner (MR), which will allow the MR to be used to map temperatures inside the body. In this proposal, NTO and the University of Utah will develop MR methods that will provide accurate and precise measurement of temperature in near real-time, allowing evaluation of this device for clinical use.",Quantifiable Thermal Therapy Using Magnetic Resonance Thermometry Imaging,9623256,R43CA233401,"['Abdomen', 'Ablation', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Burn injury', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heating', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperthermia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'In complete remission', 'Industrialization', 'International', 'Interruption', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resectable', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Thermometry', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'crowdsourcing', 'data archive', 'design', 'dosage', 'experience', 'hyperthermia treatment', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'real time monitoring', 'respiratory', 'standard of care', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor hypoxia', 'tumor microenvironment', 'virtual']",NCI,"NEOTHERMA ONCOLOGY, INC.",R43,2018,299014,0.008047374145252851
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9524416,R01EB016695,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,598063,-0.007416126399798103
"Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging Project Summary In this project we want to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric  metabolic maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution. The key to this new technology is the novel combination of three state-of-the-art imaging concepts: (A) new hardware that enables the simultaneous  measurement of multinuclear magnetic resonance (MR) signals at different frequencies; (B) the flexibility and robustness of Plug-and-Play (PnP) MR Fingerprinting (MRF); and (C) a data fusion process driven by a cross-modality model based on statistical learning. For brevity, we will call this fused simultaneous multinuclear PnP-MRF technique MNF (Multi-Nuclear Fusion). The idea behind MNF is to rapidly capture two different kinds of quantitative  information throughout the whole brain in one single scan: (1) structural information from proton (1H) MRF such as T1, T2, and proton density (PD) (tissue-scale morphology); and (2) metabolic information related to ion  homeostasis from sodium (23Na) MRF, such as intracellular sodium concentration, and intracellular, extracellular and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume fractions (cellular-scale function). Because PnP-MRF can quantify multiple  tissue properties free of experimental bias, it enables us to employ statistical learning to discover a subject-specific cross-modality model that integrates all voxelwise inter-relationships between the multi-parametric 1H PnP-MRF (acquired at high resolution, 0.75-1 mm) and 23Na PnP-MRF (acquired at low resolution, 3-5 mm) maps. These subject-specific relations can subsequently be used to sharpen the 23Na metabolic maps to match the resolution of the 1H structural maps. The high-resolution 23Na maps will enable the assessment of metabolic processes in vivo and bridge the gap in resolution that has held back our ability to study metabolism in the living human brain, which is crucial for our understanding of the brain itself and the afflictions that affect it. This proof-of-concept implementation will be developed at 7 T, but it is expected to be adaptable to clinical 3 T MR scanners. The specific aims are: (1) Data acquisition, (1.a) multi-channel 1H/23Na RF array, (1.b) simultaneous multinuclear 3D MRF sequence; (2) Data processing, (2.a) PnP-MRF reconstruction for both 1H data (fingerprint matching to generate structural maps) and 23Na data (tissue 4-compartment model and simulation of spin 3/2 dynamics to generate metabolic maps), (2.b) cross-modality model using statistical learning, and data fusion algorithm to generate high-resolution metabolic maps; (3) Method validation, (3.a) accuracy and precision, (3.b) repeatability and reproducibility.(3) Exploratory aim: Test MNF on patients with chronic steno-occlusive disease, with  recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA)/minor stroke, presenting regional brain ischemia, at 3 time points (baseline, 8-month and 16-month follow-ups), and comparison with healthy controls. Project Narrative We propose to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric metabolic 3D maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution, based on the fusion of simultaneously acquired proton and sodium data with plug-and-play magnetic resonance fingerprinting. The fusion algorithm between high- resolution proton structural maps and low-resolution sodium metabolic maps will be based on a cross-modality model optimized with statistical learning methods, and will generate for the first time high-resolution metabolic maps related to ion homeostasis in the brain in vivo. These new fused high-resolution structural and metabolic maps will provide new insights into neuro-architecture, neuro-biochemistry and their interconnection, which are crucial for our understanding of the human brain and its disorders.",Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging,9574362,R01EB026456,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Biochemistry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Fluid', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracellular Fluid', 'Ions', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'hemodynamics', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'molecular imaging', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'prototype', 'radiofrequency', 'reconstruction', 'simulation']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,685473,-0.0020214062620473954
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9517057,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'success', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2018,169609,0.012780511474514249
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,9595406,R01EB009690,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body Image', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,703347,0.020935329441825325
"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9548457,R01AR068456,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Bone structure', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'fracture risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2018,273031,0.01821495207873368
"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9571234,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2018,550445,-0.0356148556763926
"Cloud quantitative imaging for whole-body tumor burden in neurofibromatoses Project Summary / Abstract The neurofibromatoses (NFs), including NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis, are a group of autosomal-dominant neurogenetic disorders characterized by a predisposition in virtually 100% of patients to develop multiple nerve sheath tumors. The determination of tumor burden on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indispensable for the longitudinal management of NF patients, which includes life-long follow-up for the monitoring of tumor progression and the assessment of treatment response. However, volumetric quantification of NF tumors is not a clinical routine because of the technical challenges in the accurate and reproducible segmentation of highly-irregular and infiltrating NF tumors, in particular plexiform neurofibromas on MRI. The goal of this STTR project is to develop cloud quantitative imaging (CQI) for NF software, denoted as CQI-NF, which will provide the technical and clinical service for volumetric quantification of NF tumors on whole-body and regional MRI via ""virtualization"" (cloud computing) technology. The product developed in this STTR will provide access to this technology for the NF clinical community nationwide and worldwide without the excessive cost to maintain on-site advanced volumetric imaging analysis software and hardware. This project will be built upon existing technologies for volumetric imaging analysis developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using 200 longitudinal whole-body and regional MRI cases collected from the NF community worldwide. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of CQI-NF system: We will continue to develop the CQI-NF system prototyped in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy and efficiency of segmentation by paralleling dynamic-threshold level set (DT level set) in multi-server platform, combining deep-learning in DT level set for the segmentation of NF tumors, and to translate the CQI-NF system from 3DQI/NF into a private cloud platform (such as TeraRecon's iNtuition CLOUD) for the provision of volumetric quantification of NF using a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model in the NF community. (2) Evaluation of CQI-NF system: We will conduct a retrospective clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of the CQI-NF system in the longitudinal monitoring of 200 NF patients collected at MGH Cancer Center and our clinical collaborators worldwide in the NF community. (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for CQI-NF to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of CQI-NF. The successful development and validation of the proposed CQI-NF system will have a high clinical impact in the NF community by providing a cloud-computing infrastructure for the volumetric imaging analysis of NF on MRI, which is not available in current clinical routine, thereby leading to a substantial advance in the longitudinal management of NF patients.

"Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT Project Summary: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. Diagnosis and stratification of disease phenotypes are important in order to decipher the effects of novel therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individuals. Few computerized diagnostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with visual and surgical lung biopsy; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good predictive models with localized region exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use as a derivative dataset the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF and 266 patients with IPF suspected, but not IPF based on HRCT and the surgical biopsy who have participated in multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for high through-put quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier with features of anatomic distribution and reproducible imaging features expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score, testing on separate data from in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitial Lung Disease Program. Furthermore, the second aim is to develop a rate of progression at local region and to aggregate predictive models using Cox proportional regression models, which will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that diagnose and anticipate disease course in patients with IPF and subdividing patients into more homogeneous groups prior to the development of significant respiratory impairment. We anticipate that models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions to define more homogeneous cohorts for purposes of testing new targeted therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. Relevance to Public Health: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rate of progression is highly variables, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using new drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to diagnose and predict disease course robustly in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with IPF and non-IPF with reducing chance of lung biopsy and predict slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more time to treat patients and timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Automated Diagnosis and Progression Rate of IPF Using HRCT,9592308,R21HL140465,"['Acute', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stable Disease', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'functional decline', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2018,113241,-0.03224780337242044
"New Approach to Quantitative Beta Amyloid Imaging Using PET Summary This project seeks to prove the commercial feasibility of a new approach to analyzing dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data that would improve sensitivity, quantitative accuracy, and accessibility of imaging the biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent progress in understanding the nature of neurodegenerative diseases — especially evidence that the onset of cognitive symptoms of AD can be mitigated —amplify the critical need of improved quantitative evaluation of AD biomarkers. Dynamic PET may be the most accurate modality capable of achieving this goal. However, current strategies of analyzing dynamic PET images either require complex acquisition protocols with invasive arterial blood sampling procedures or rely on accuracy-degrading approximations such as compartment modeling. We have developed Intelligent Dynamics-Driven Quantitative Diagnostics (IDDQD), a novel processing approach based on factor analysis of dynamic structures with partial clustering used to initiate the process. We have shown that an early version of IDDQD can extract blood and tissue tracer dynamics and the corresponding spatial distributions from 11C-PIB PET scans. SolvingDynamics Inc plans to offer a Research-as-a-Service data processing workflow that will apply IDDQD to dynamic brain PET datasets acquired by the customers, producing accurate quantitative tracer dynamics time-activity curves (TACs) and the distribution of the targeted tissues, including the AD biomarkers beta-amyloid and tau. Our proprietary algorithm does not require the tracer dynamics model to achieve steady state, so a shorter scan can be used to generate results of similar or better accuracy than those produced by current approaches, such as reference tissue- based methods. In this proposal, SolvingDynamics seeks to prove the feasibility of our proposed approach by comparing the diagnostics obtained using IDDQD analysis of dynamic PET data and those obtained from independent measurements. A subcontract group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been conducting dynamic 11C-PIB PET studies for several years and has accumulated over 70 cases with PET data matched to both cognitive-memory tests and to post-mortem pathology studies. SolvingDynamics will retrospectively apply its analysis technique to these datasets and compare its computed tissue distributions to standardized uptake volume ratio (SUVR) and distribution volume ratio (DVR) data. A subset of 20 dynamic 11C-PIB PET datasets ranging in length from 15 to 90 minutes will also be analyzed in order to validate the feasibility of reducing the imaging time. In addition, similar studies aimed at reducing imaging time with IDDQD will be performed for 20 PET scans acquired using 18F-AV1451 tracer to image tau. PROJECT NARRATIVE Positron emission tomography image analysis methodology to be validated in this project aims to improve sensitivity and specificity of tissue analysis in dynamic positron emission tomography, improving diagnosis of Alzheimer's diseases and other neurodegenerative disorders.

"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,9449456,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'clinical imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2018,64155,0.0018607228404499156
"A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials Project Summary/Abstract There has been a shift to greater use of neadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in the clinical management of cancer. Often used in breast cancer to provide systemic treatment for possible or apparent metastatic disease, NACT also reduces the primary tumor size and facilitates breast conservation. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is an effective diagnostic for monitoring tumor regression. There are many methodologies being developed for monitoring cancer in vivo, including contrast agent washout, volumetry, and more recently correlating apparent diffusion coefficients and proton relaxation times to tumor staging. Such imaging biomarkers are predictive of the pathological complete response (pCR) outcome prior to surgery. This enables physicians to provide “evidence based” treatment modifications to reduce deleterious side effects and improve patient outcomes. To obtain quantitative data from MR images, the variations that occur in imaging as a result of hardware and software differences between MRI manufacturers and day-to-day operations must be quantified. In MRI, the data depends on the protocols used to acquire the image, resulting in inconsistencies if even one parameter in the protocol changes. The goal of the proposed work is to produce and develop and disseminate a ground truth physical standard and quality control program for comparison of MRI scanners in the multisite I-SPY2 (ACRIN 6698) trials monitoring pre-operative chemotherapy treatments in the reduction of tumor size. The physical standard is an anthropomorphic breast phantom capable of fitting into all commercial breast coils. It contains novel human tissue mimics and geometric standards with values traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Analysis software capable of protocol compliance checks, rapid identification of the regions of interest, and comparison to ground truth values as measured by NIST will be developed to complement the physical standard. This will enable qualification of sites and quantification of error resulting from scanner performance alone. Given the wide breadth of parameter space that MRI protocols encompass, part of the proposed effort will include the development of protocols specific to image acquisition of tumor volumes and for measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient within the tumor volumes as compared to surrounding healthy tissue. Project Narrative: Quantitative imaging complements precision medicine initiatives by providing a noninvasive method of monitoring gene specific in vivo treatment of diseases ranging from cancer to neurological disorders. To realize quantitative imaging, variations in imaging hardware, software, and procedures must be mitigated. This project will develop a quality assurance and quality control procedure for multisite clinical trials involved in monitoring therapeutic efficacy using MR breast imaging.",A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials,9678297,R44CA235820,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Breast', 'Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Breast conservation', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Volume', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cloud based', 'computer aided detection', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'human tissue', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'nervous system disorder', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'operation', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'quality assurance', 'quantitative imaging', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,"CALIBERMRI, INC.",R44,2018,224422,-0.026506743660064662
"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET. While the imaging developments are generally applicable to all PET tracers in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, since cancer is the primary clinical application of PET, we will focus our investigation and optimization in this project on three lung cancer imaging tracers at different clinical adoption stages as examples: 1) 18F-FDG as a routine clinical tracer, 2) 18F-FMISO for hypoxia studies as a tracer for human research, and 3) 18F-PD-L1 that specifically binds to human PD-L1 in tumors and other organs as a recent first-in-human tracer.

"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET. While the imaging developments are generally applicable to all PET tracers in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, since cancer is the primary clinical application of PET, we will focus our investigation and optimization in this project on three lung cancer imaging tracers at different clinical adoption stages as examples: 1) 18F-FDG as a routine clinical tracer, 2) 18F-FMISO for hypoxia studies as a tracer for human research, and 3) 18F-PD-L1 that specifically binds to human PD-L1 in tumors and other organs as a recent first-in-human tracer. For each tracer, we will investigate 1) static PET, 2) gated and respiratory motion corrected PET, and 3) dynamic PET. Project narrative Patient radiation dose is a major concern in PET imaging.

"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,9547416,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,597688,0.033809128808384374
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research.

"New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging Project Summary To more fully exploit the basic science of mechanobiology as it pertains to breast cancer progression, the medical imaging field continues to search for fast, safe, and effective elasticity imaging methods. In this project we propose a fundamentally new approach to ultrasonic elasticity imaging in which the weak forces applied to patient tissues and the measured displacements that result are used to train a numerical model specifically for that patient. This constitutive model is developed using finite-element methods and neural networks assembled in a unique configuration called the AutoProgressive (AutoP) Method. AutoP “learns” complete stress and strain properties directly from sparse force and displacement measurements and without a mathematical model. Using quasi-static stimuli, AutoP exploits the fact that each force-displacement estimate contains information about mechanical properties at all locations in the contiguous tissue. From measurement information and conservation laws, AutoP generates an informational model without the need to make assumptions about tissue linearity, isotropy, or other material properties normally required when constructing images that display tissue mechanical properties. Once an accurate material-property model is formed by AutoP, we adopt a separate rheological model (e.g., Kelvin Voigt) to form viscoelastic parameters for image display. The AutoP method employs beamformed RF-echo acquisitions from which point displacements are estimated, applied compressional force sensed at the transducer surface, and tissue shape.  No other imaging method is capable of estimating all relevant stress fields, which gives AutoP unique capabilities. AutoP estimates the mechanical properties that one strives to obtain from an inverse problem approach, but AutoP is not a mathematical inverse technique and hence does not suffer from nonunique solutions. Without the need to assume material properties, AutoP can (in principle) model tissue properties in three dimensions and in time following large deformations in highly-nonlinear, anisotropic media. This R21 proposal focuses on establishing the feasibility of the AutoP methodology for subsequent clinical trials under future funding. At the completion of this two-year project, we will demonstrate a new tool for medical imaging capable of exploring the mechanical properties of tissues over a very broad range of deformations. We specifically target ultrasonic methods and quasi-static force stimuli in this project. However AutoP could eventually be coupled to other imaging modalities (e.g., MRE, OCE) or dynamic force-stimulus methods.  The scientific premise underlying AutoP is that we already record all of the information needed to generate a very broad range of elasticity images. The key to unlocking this information is to set aside mathematical models in favor of data-driven informational models built using the unique machine learning abilities of the AutoP method. If successful, AutoP will have a major influence on medical elasticity imaging methods. Project Narrative: A new type of machine-learning method is proposed for elasticity imaging of patient tissues that offers the potential to minimize many current limitations. If we are successful in this development, ultrasonic elasticity imaging would significantly improve in its ability to accurately represent mechanical properties of breast tissues, without any changes in current instrumentation and without increasing cost to the healthcare system or adding risk to patients.",New Approach to US Elasticity Imaging,9385425,R21EB023402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Isotropy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modulus', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonics', 'Writing', 'aged', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cost', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'imaging properties', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical properties', 'model building', 'model development', 'novel strategies', 'object shape', 'processing speed', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'viscoelasticity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2017,220062,0.0057169672738006825
"Interpreting limits to nanoparticle delivery in high-stroma low-perfusion tumors 4.4.7 Project Summary/Abstract  The central theme in this work is that critical spatial patterns exist in highly resistant cancer stroma and vascular density that inherently inhibit larger nanoparticle penetration into cancer, and that these phenotypes can be imaged in vivo. We will use in vivo diagnostic imaging, combined with ex vivo analysis to test this in pancreatic cancer, which has as well known drug penetration limitation. Specifically, we will quantify nanoparticle penetration in pancreas cancer, which has high stroma content and low vascular density. The analysis and prediction of efficacy will be quantitatively developed by methodological correlation of in-vivo and ex vivo images using Fourier spatial frequency analysis.  We will determine the characteristic spatial patterns of these tumor microstructures that present as barriers to nanoparticle transport, as assayed through in vivo/ex vivo studies. We have seen that these characteristic spectral features appear in high-field magnetic resonance imaging (HF-MRI) scans and micro-Computed Tomography (uCT) scans of tumors imaged within the ongoing nanoparticle project at DHMC. The scope of this project is to conduct a secondary analysis on the images that are being produced within these projects, with two specific aims. 1) We will directly correlate nanoparticle penetration and distribution to the Fourier spatial frequencies found in in vivo images by Fourier spatial frequency analysis in which we have demonstrated expertise. The in vivo images will be analyzed by correlating them with histological sections of nanoparticle distribution post-treatment. Tumors will be classified on two levels as either a high or low permeability to a specific nanoparticle formulation (to quantify the amount of agent delivered), and as having high or low isotropy (to quantify the dispersion of the agent). 2) We will then apply this characteristic morphology analysis to pre-treatment, pre-operative HF-MRI, uCT images, and analyze their value as a potential diagnostic classifier. We will use a Support Vector Machine Analysis to predict the permeability and isotropy of unknown tumors, and validate our results against experimental outcomes. An iterative strategy will optimize the predictive power of the method, and be used to distinguish between characteristic spectra that are good and bad classifiers.  The research will be produced using the unique software systems that we have designed during preliminary studies, and will be deployed on an analysis platform that can be integrated with the hospital- based DICOM and virtual pathology environment to allow clinical investigators to plan adjuvant therapies to promote nanoparticle efficacy. Several hundred high-quality scans are now available for analysis, which will be processed and reported on within the first year of funding. By year two, the established system is projected to be able to analyze images within a few minutes post-scan. These analysis methods will give us the key background needed to advance our fundamental understanding of nanoparticle in-vivo delivery, and test ways to interrupt transport barriers in interventional future work. 4.4.8 Project Narrative The PI will apply a novel image analysis method to identify spatial patterns in images taken from in vivo experiments that indicate the presence of physical barriers to nanoparticle and liposomal transport in solid cancer tumor.

"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue.

"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9382777,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,711253,0.005521664212073711
"Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic cardiomyopathy affects approximately 3 million people in the United States. This form of heart failure is the result of myocardial infarcton or severe coronary heart disease that reduces the viability and function of the heart. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with poor long-term survival when patients with viable myocardium are not revascularized. By imaging myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism and seeking flow-metabolism mismatches, positron emission tomography (PET) method has been established as the gold standard of assessing myocardial viability for selecting patients who can benefit most from surgical revascularization. Current PET method employs two separate static scans with two different radiotracers for generation of the flow-metabolism image pair. While the image of glucose metabolism is acquired using the most widely used radiotracer 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), myocardial blood flow imaging with the radiotracer 13N-ammonia or rubidium-82 suffers from limited clinical availability. In addition, the imaging protoco of two separate imaging sessions is time consuming and resource intensive. As a result, myocardial viability via PET is currently under-utilized in clinic despite its high accuracy and th fast-growing installation of PET/CT scanners in the past decade. In this project, we propose to develop a novel PET method for myocardial viability assessment that only uses a single injection of FDG without the need of a flow- specific radiotracer. We hypothesize that myocardial blood flow can be derived from the quantitative kinetic parameters of dynamic FDG PET. We will develop a new multi-variable prediction model using statistical machine learning to predict myocardial blood flow from dynamic FDG PET data. We will also develop a shortened dynamic FDG PET protocol to improve practicality. This innovation will provide the flow-metabolism image pair for myocardial viability assessment in a clinically favorable time, cost and with reduced radiation dose. Success of this research will make PET assessment of myocardial viability more widely available in clinic with easier access, lower radiation dose, cheaper imaging cost and shorter clinical visit time as compared with conventional two-session protocols, thus improving our clinical practice of treating ischemic cardiomyopathy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a gold standard method for detecting viable myocardium to select which patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy to benefit most from surgical revascularization. Its use in clinic, however, is under-utilized because of the limited clinical availability of the radiotracers needed. This research aims to develop a novel PET imaging method for assessment of myocardial viability that can be easily accessed in clinic with reduced lower radiation dose and imaging cost without compromising imaging performance.",Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET,9251317,R21HL131385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ammonia', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cyclotrons', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Investments', 'Kinetics', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rubidium', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tracer', 'United States', 'Visit', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose transport', 'heart function', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'ischemic cardiomyopathy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'public health relevance', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2017,195625,-0.0035489522694253702
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information.

"MRI brain morphometry for computer-aided detection of neurological disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The technology that is routinely available to neuroradiologists is years or decades behind that which is used in imaging research throughout the world. Current clinical decision-making in neuroradiology is based on information that is insufficient for detecting the subtle changes that presage clinically significant conditions such a a growing tumor, enlarging ventricle, or shrinking hippocampus.  Tools that are regularly used in research are not accessible in the clinic due to a number of factors: slow execution speed, sensitivity to scanner manufacturer, field strength and pulse sequence, and lack of FDA clearance. In this project we seek to remove these barriers by further developing FreeSurfer, the world's premier automated brain morphometry package, to (1) integrate novel deep-learning and Random Forest- based patch-matching image synthesis technology into FreeSurfer to make it robust to variations in scanner platform and acquisition parameters, (2) use modern parallel-processing to reduce execution time to a clinically-feasible length, and (3) obtain FDA clearance on the tools allowing them to be routinely used in direct patient care.  The resulting product would dramatically improve the information that neuroradiologists have access to for patient diagnosis, staging, and the assessment of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for disorders including AD, tumor, hydrocephalus, and epilepsy, to name a few.

"Exploring the Role of Mitochondrial Fission in Pancreatic Tumorigenesis Project Summary A wealth of data over the past few years, from our lab and others, has demonstrated that the mitochondrial morphology of tumor cells is distinct from normal cells. Furthermore, a number of studies have shown that genetic or pharmacological manipulation of the machinery that regulates mitochondrial morphology can impact a variety of tumorigenic processes. Indeed, in work performed for the parent grant of this proposal, we have shown that genetic inhibition of the mitochondrial fission GTPase Drp1 can block pancreatic tumor growth and increase survival in a genetically engineered mouse model. This work has led to the deeper question of how changes in mitochondrial shape, which ultimately result from a combination of both genetic and environmental influences, contribute to the physiological processes that drive tumor growth. This question has been difficult to ask using traditional genetic and pharmacological approaches due to the complexity of the signaling pathways that converge on the mitochondria and the inherent heterogeneity present within the tumor and its surrounding stroma. To that end, we have developed a new software package designed to catalogue the morphological features of mitochondria within cells in culture or in fixed tissue. By using this software to analyze the tumor cells developed in our mouse models of pancreatic cancer, we propose to determine the relationship between specific mitochondrial features and key physiological attributes of these tumors. To do this, we have developed a machine learning technique, validated against a panel of tumor derived pancreatic cell lines with genetically-induced mitochondrial heterogeneity, capable of identifying relationships between mitochondrial features, or combinations of mitochondrial features, and other attributes of those cells. This approach will allow us to leverage the wealth of phenotypic data we have collected from our tumors with the data we are now able to collect on the mitochondrial heterogeneity, either between or within those tumors, in order to identify the role that mitochondrial heterogeneity plays in tumor growth, regardless of whether that heterogeneity arises from manipulation of the mitochondrial dynamics machinery or whether it arises from the myriad influences within the tumor environment. Successful completion of these aims will provide critical insights into the role that mitochondrial heterogeneity plays in pancreatic tumor growth and also pave the way for future analysis of mitochondrial heterogeneity in other tumor types. Project Narrative Our work exploring the role of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission in pancreatic tumor growth, using two relevant mouse models, has revealed that genetic inhibition of Drp1 can inhibit tumor growth and extend survival. In addition, these models provide a wealth of data to more deeply explore the relationship between mitochondrial heterogeneity and tumor physiology. We have developed robust computational methodology with which to explore this relationship. This exciting novel approach will provide critical insight into pancreatic tumorigenesis and potentially uncover novel therapeutic approaches.",Exploring the Role of Mitochondrial Fission in Pancreatic Tumorigenesis,9384887,R01CA200755,"['Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Models', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease Progression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Inter-tumoral heterogeneity', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Normal Cell', 'Oncogenic', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pancreatic cell line', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'pancreatic tumorigenesis', 'parent grant', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumorigenic', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2017,191853,-0.003726772347354358
"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence.

"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9312109,F30CA206291,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2017,49044,0.0468110667434005
"Area B:  Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to Measure Tumor Glutamine and Glucose Metabolic Rates in a Single Imaging Session Precision oncology places an increased demand on cancer diagnostics to characterize tumors at the time of diagnosis. Tissue diagnostics for precision oncology increasingly rely on multi-valent assays to characterize cancer biology and identify therapeutic targets. The power of molecular imaging for cancer diagnosis has been well demonstrated by [18F]fluorodexoyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT), widely used in clinical oncology. PET tracers targeted to facets of tumor biology now enable multi-valent molecular imaging to identify therapeutic targets. Early studies show that combined tracer studies, commonly FDG plus a target- specific tracer, are highly predictive of tumor response to targeted therapy. However, emissions from different PET tracers are indistinguishable to a PET scanner, requiring separate imaging sessions on separate days for multiple 18F-based tracers (~ 2 hour half-life) in the same patient. This limits the clinical practicality of multi-tracer PET, and fails to exploit the full power of multi-tracer PET to quantify tumor in vivo biology and biologic heterogeneity for highly variable process such as cancer metabolism. We will overcome this limitation by taking advantage of recent developments in volumetric PET scanners, fast reconstruction, and 4D image analysis methods from our laboratories to develop Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate multi-valent, quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session to guide precision oncology and translational cancer biology research. As such, our proposed technology development project addresses a need, described under Priority Area B for “new capabilities for advancing precise clinical diagnosis of cancer patients”. Using methods developed in our laboratories, we now propose to integrate and enhance these methodologies to develop and validate Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session. We will develop and test this approach for simultaneous glucose and glutamine metabolism imaging, with the goal of guiding metabolism-targeted therapy such as inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The project will focus on the technology developments (largely computational) that enable multi-tracer imaging. Ongoing and separately funded work on clinical studies will acquire data from two separate imaging PET sessions using current technology and will provide data for method development. We will first optimize tracer dose timing, image reconstruction, and image time binning for dual tracer MTV-PET (Aim 1), followed by implementation and technical validation of image analysis using a mixture analysis approach (Aim 2). This will set the stage for technical validation of MTV-PET (Aim 3) and an exploratory aim (Aim 4) testing image analytics based on machine learning. Successful completion of our technology development will yield a new method for multi-tracer PET that would change the landscape for cancer imaging diagnostic biomarker and precision oncology research, consistent with goals of RFA-CA-17-023 Priority Area B. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposed technology development in response to RFA-CA-17-023 (Integration and Validation of Emerging Technologies to Accelerate Cancer Research) addresses a need for more precise diagnosis for precision oncology, under Priority Area B: “New capabilities for advancing precise clinical diagnosis of cancer patients”. We will advantage of recent developments in volumetric positron emission tomography (PET) scanners, fast reconstruction, and 4D image analysis to develop methods for multi-tracer PET with the goal of generating quantitative, multi-parametric whole-body images of specific aspects of cancer biology, including cancer metabolism as the focus of our proposed technology development projects. Successful completion of our proposed technology development will yield a clinically practical method for multi-tracer PET that would provide multi-valent, whole body molecular parametric images that would change the landscape for cancer imaging diagnostic biomarkers and precision oncology research, targeted to RFA-CA-17-023 Priority Area B.",Area B:  Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to Measure Tumor Glutamine and Glucose Metabolic Rates in a Single Imaging Session,9483034,R33CA225310,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Funding', 'Glucose', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lactate Dehydrogenase', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'genomic biomarker', 'glucose metabolism', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic rate', 'method development', 'molecular imaging', 'novel', 'parametric imaging', 'personalized diagnostics', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'precision oncology', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'technology development', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor metabolism', 'whole body imaging']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R33,2017,1448329,0.015537936798266278
"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9389124,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injectable', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2017,716510,0.04375482679544129
"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9264495,R01CA197000,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Burden', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Image', 'In complete remission', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Property', 'Registries', 'Residual Cancers', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'computerized tools', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,449175,0.049247591432158004
"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9324146,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Privatization', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,487132,0.015208289015528108
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9333447,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2017,544581,-0.0073591010852733256
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9314557,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'forest', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,644766,-0.006103597702349865
"Development of automated web-based spectroscopic MRI clinical interface Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Infiltration of glioma cells into surrounding normal brain make curative surgical resection of GBM impossible, and almost all will eventually recur. Thus, extraordinary significance is placed on radiation therapy (RT) strategies, which have been shown to be effective, but require strong imaging evidence to guide RT planning. Currently employed clinical imaging modalities include T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI, which only identifies leaky neovasculature associated with high grade tumor, and T2-weighted MRI, which is not specific for tumor infiltration. Through advances in neurosurgery, it is now possible to achieve complete or near-complete resection of the CE tumor component in many cases; thus, the region that is treated with the highest RT dose is limited to the empty resection cavity plus a small margin. Due to the generally larger size of the T2 area and unknown status of disease, it is treated to a lesser “microscopic disease” dose. Many times, however, this microscopic disease dose is inadequate to control the tumor. Spectroscopic MR imaging (sMRI) provides a highly sensitive and specific means of identifying these regions, although sMRI has not yet seen use in RT planning due to a lack of clinical decision support software for the analysis, display, and management of sMRI data. Three key hurdles to be overcome are: 1) lack of an automatic, fast and reliable method for spectral quality control; 2) the necessity of quantification of metabolite levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism; and 3) a clinician- friendly display of the sMRI spectra encoded as a high-resolution, continuous, 3D image set for direct registration and incorporation into the RT planning process. Currently, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and shepherding data between several tools, resulting in a complex workflow that takes hours and is impractical for routine use in a fast-paced clinical RT environment. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to radiation oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in RT planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning. Specifically, we will develop algorithmic filters for identifying (and eliminating) spectral artifacts, algorithms for personalized localization of tumor infiltration, and methods and interfaces for the volumetric display of sMRI data needed for RT planning and review. Success in the proposed work will produce an automated “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into routine clinical applications. This tool will also be highly valuable in the MRS-based diagnosis and evaluation of numerous other neuropathologies, including other primary (and metastatic) brain tumors, stroke, multiple sclerosis (and other demyelinating diseases), inborn errors of metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases. Project Narrative There is widespread agreement that MR spectroscopy can provide valuable information without the need for exogenous contrast agents, however the software tools needed to incorporate whole brain 3D spectroscopic MRI (sMRI) into clinical practice are lacking. We plan to develop a web-based sMRI clinical interface for the analysis, visualization and integration of sMRI data into patient management. This “scanner-to-clinician” platform is designed to provide quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis in order to integrate sMRI into the routine radiation therapy planning process. In addition, this user-friendly tool will be highly valuable in the sMRI-based diagnosis and evaluation of numerous other neuropathologies aside from cancer, including other primary (and metastatic) brain tumors, stroke, multiple sclerosis (and other demyelinating diseases), inborn errors of metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Development of automated web-based spectroscopic MRI clinical interface,9332618,R21NS100244,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'High-LET Radiation', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Surgically-Created Resection Cavity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Water', 'Work', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'expectation', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'neovasculature', 'neuropathology', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,233258,0.03617230335880755
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9300962,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2017,169609,0.012780511474514249
"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9274155,R01AR068456,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Bone structure', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'fracture risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2017,269514,0.01821495207873368
"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences.

"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9388399,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2017,446226,-0.0356148556763926
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,9244841,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'clinical imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2017,63883,0.0018607228404499156
"Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and highest-grade astrocytoma with uniformly dismal prognosis. In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration. Therefore, it will present a broad impact on future translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated analysis of spatial configurations of tissue pathologic features and underlying molecular biomarkers accounting for cancer progression is an important way to understand tumor expansion mechanisms. To advance in this research field, I propose to develop automated image analysis tools, database-based spatial integration methods, and mathematical models for tumor microenvironment representation to support quantitative investigations on Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor invasion mechanisms with definitive pathology imaging and multiplexed molecular biomarker data from whole-slide images of GBM specimens.",Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol,9315122,K25CA181503,"['Accounting', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytoma', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Glioblastoma', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'Location', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Necrosis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Dots', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Variant', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'computer science', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'genomic biomarker', 'high throughput analysis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'spatial integration', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K25,2017,119048,0.016154183692066032
"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging.

"Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microscope techniques to image inside brain tissue are generally limited by poor depth penetration. Micro-endoscopy, wherein a probe is physically inserted into the tissue, can overcome this limitation in depth penetration, but at the expense of invasiveness and tissue damage due to the size of the probe. Our goal here is to palliate these problems by developing an ultra-miniature microendoscope probe based on a single, lensless optical fiber.  The direct transmission of an image through an optical ﬁber is diﬃcult because spatial information becomes scrambled upon propagation. We have recently demonstrated an image transmission strategy where spatial information is ﬁrst converted to spectral information. Our strategy is based on a principle of spread-spectrum encoding, borrowed from wireless communications, wherein object pixels are converted into distinct spectral codes that span the full bandwidth of the object spectrum. Image recovery is performed by numerical inversion of the detected spectrum at the ﬁber output. We have provided a simple demonstration of spread-spectrum encoding using macroscopic Fabry-Perot etalons. Our technique enables the 2D imaging of luminous (i.e. fluorescent or bioluminescent) objects with high throughput independent of pixel number. Moreover, it is insensitive to ﬁber bending, contains no moving parts, and opens the attractive possibility of extreme miniaturization down to the size of a single optical fiber.  Our goal here is to develop, characterize, and establish the versatility of a new class of ultra-miniature fiber probes that can provide functional 2D brain imaging at arbitrary depths and with minimal tissue damage. Our strategy will involve probe development, machine-learning algorithm development, and the actual demonstration of microendoscopic imaging in freely moving behaving animals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently demonstrated a strategy to image through a single, lensless optical fiber. We propose to develop this into an ultraminiaturized microendoscope for functional brain imaging with minimal surgical damage in freely moving behaving animals.",Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals,9137657,R21EY026310,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Fiber', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Microscope', 'Miniaturization', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Penetration', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'imprint', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lens', 'microscopic imaging', 'miniaturize', 'minimally invasive', 'optical fiber', 'optical imaging', 'photonics', 'portability', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'targeted imaging', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NEI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2016,246750,0.01378466316994802
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits. However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery.

"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,9119020,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Polynomial Models', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2016,222652,0.045666973184301324
"Interpreting limits to nanoparticle delivery in high-stroma low-perfusion tumors 4.4.7 Project Summary/Abstract  The central theme in this work is that critical spatial patterns exist in highly resistant cancer stroma and vascular density that inherently inhibit larger nanoparticle penetration into cancer, and that these phenotypes can be imaged in vivo. We will use in vivo diagnostic imaging, combined with ex vivo analysis to test this in pancreatic cancer, which has as well known drug penetration limitation. Specifically, we will quantify nanoparticle penetration in pancreas cancer, which has high stroma content and low vascular density. The analysis and prediction of efficacy will be quantitatively developed by methodological correlation of in-vivo and ex vivo images using Fourier spatial frequency analysis.  We will determine the characteristic spatial patterns of these tumor microstructures that present as barriers to nanoparticle transport, as assayed through in vivo/ex vivo studies. We have seen that these characteristic spectral features appear in high-field magnetic resonance imaging (HF-MRI) scans and micro-Computed Tomography (uCT) scans of tumors imaged within the ongoing nanoparticle project at DHMC. The scope of this project is to conduct a secondary analysis on the images that are being produced within these projects, with two specific aims. 1) We will directly correlate nanoparticle penetration and distribution to the Fourier spatial frequencies found in in vivo images by Fourier spatial frequency analysis in which we have demonstrated expertise. The in vivo images will be analyzed by correlating them with histological sections of nanoparticle distribution post-treatment. Tumors will be classified on two levels as either a high or low permeability to a specific nanoparticle formulation (to quantify the amount of agent delivered), and as having high or low isotropy (to quantify the dispersion of the agent). 2) We will then apply this characteristic morphology analysis to pre-treatment, pre-operative HF-MRI, uCT images, and analyze their value as a potential diagnostic classifier. We will use a Support Vector Machine Analysis to predict the permeability and isotropy of unknown tumors, and validate our results against experimental outcomes. An iterative strategy will optimize the predictive power of the method, and be used to distinguish between characteristic spectra that are good and bad classifiers.  The research will be produced using the unique software systems that we have designed during preliminary studies, and will be deployed on an analysis platform that can be integrated with the hospital- based DICOM and virtual pathology environment to allow clinical investigators to plan adjuvant therapies to promote nanoparticle efficacy. Several hundred high-quality scans are now available for analysis, which will be processed and reported on within the first year of funding. By year two, the established system is projected to be able to analyze images within a few minutes post-scan. These analysis methods will give us the key background needed to advance our fundamental understanding of nanoparticle in-vivo delivery, and test ways to interrupt transport barriers in interventional future work. 4.4.8 Project Narrative The PI will apply a novel image analysis method to identify spatial patterns in images taken from in vivo experiments that indicate the presence of physical barriers to nanoparticle and liposomal transport in solid cancer tumor.

"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning.

"Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic cardiomyopathy affects approximately 3 million people in the United States. This form of heart failure is the result of myocardial infarcton or severe coronary heart disease that reduces the viability and function of the heart. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with poor long-term survival when patients with viable myocardium are not revascularized. By imaging myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism and seeking flow-metabolism mismatches, positron emission tomography (PET) method has been established as the gold standard of assessing myocardial viability for selecting patients who can benefit most from surgical revascularization. Current PET method employs two separate static scans with two different radiotracers for generation of the flow-metabolism image pair. While the image of glucose metabolism is acquired using the most widely used radiotracer 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), myocardial blood flow imaging with the radiotracer 13N-ammonia or rubidium-82 suffers from limited clinical availability. In addition, the imaging protoco of two separate imaging sessions is time consuming and resource intensive. As a result, myocardial viability via PET is currently under-utilized in clinic despite its high accuracy and th fast-growing installation of PET/CT scanners in the past decade. In this project, we propose to develop a novel PET method for myocardial viability assessment that only uses a single injection of FDG without the need of a flow- specific radiotracer. We hypothesize that myocardial blood flow can be derived from the quantitative kinetic parameters of dynamic FDG PET. We will develop a new multi-variable prediction model using statistical machine learning to predict myocardial blood flow from dynamic FDG PET data. We will also develop a shortened dynamic FDG PET protocol to improve practicality. This innovation will provide the flow-metabolism image pair for myocardial viability assessment in a clinically favorable time, cost and with reduced radiation dose. Success of this research will make PET assessment of myocardial viability more widely available in clinic with easier access, lower radiation dose, cheaper imaging cost and shorter clinical visit time as compared with conventional two-session protocols, thus improving our clinical practice of treating ischemic cardiomyopathy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a gold standard method for detecting viable myocardium to select which patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy to benefit most from surgical revascularization. Its use in clinic, however, is under-utilized because of the limited clinical availability of the radiotracers needed. This research aims to develop a novel PET imaging method for assessment of myocardial viability that can be easily accessed in clinic with reduced lower radiation dose and imaging cost without compromising imaging performance.              ",Simultaneous imaging of myocardial blood flow and glucose metabolism using dynamic 18F-FDG PET,9020059,R21HL131385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ammonia', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cyclotrons', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Investments', 'Kinetics', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rubidium', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'United States', 'Visit', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose transport', 'heart function', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'ischemic cardiomyopathy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2016,234875,-0.0035489522694253702
"MRI brain morphometry for computer-aided detection of neurological disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The technology that is routinely available to neuroradiologists is years or decades behind that which is used in imaging research throughout the world. Current clinical decision-making in neuroradiology is based on information that is insufficient for detecting the subtle changes that presage clinically significant conditions such a a growing tumor, enlarging ventricle, or shrinking hippocampus.  Tools that are regularly used in research are not accessible in the clinic due to a number of factors: slow execution speed, sensitivity to scanner manufacturer, field strength and pulse sequence, and lack of FDA clearance. In this project we seek to remove these barriers by further developing FreeSurfer, the world's premier automated brain morphometry package, to (1) integrate novel deep-learning and Random Forest- based patch-matching image synthesis technology into FreeSurfer to make it robust to variations in scanner platform and acquisition parameters, (2) use modern parallel-processing to reduce execution time to a clinically-feasible length, and (3) obtain FDA clearance on the tools allowing them to be routinely used in direct patient care.  The resulting product would dramatically improve the information that neuroradiologists have access to for patient diagnosis, staging, and the assessment of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for disorders including AD, tumor, hydrocephalus, and epilepsy, to name a few. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology that is currently routinely available to neuroradiologists is years or decades behind that which is used in imaging research throughout the world. In this proposal we seek to bridge the gap between research and the clinic, by developing a clinical utility based on FreeSurfer, the world's leading software package for automated brain morphometry. The result will be a tool that dramatically increases the accuracy, sensitivity and robustness of clinicians' abilities to diagnose, stage and assess treatment efficacy in a wide array of neurologic conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, tumor and hydrocephalus, to name a few.",MRI brain morphometry for computer-aided detection of neurological disorders,9321735,R44NS089090,"['Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Patch Tests', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Sales', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Subject Headings', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically significant', 'computer aided detection', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'direct patient care', 'forest', 'improved', 'meetings', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,"CORTICOMETRICS, LLC",R44,2016,761416,0.006944056653801643
"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence.

"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9191930,F30CA206291,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'contrast enhanced', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'histological image', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2016,43576,0.0468110667434005
"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",9132190,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Survival', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,626891,0.015208289015528108
"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.        ",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9106459,R01CA197000,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Burden', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Image', 'In complete remission', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Property', 'Registries', 'Residual Cancers', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'computerized tools', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,498724,0.049247591432158004
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.            ",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9150339,R01NS095411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,547736,-0.0073591010852733256
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9186255,R01CA206180,"['Accounting', 'Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cone', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'forest', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,669786,-0.006103597702349865
"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals. The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.",Objective decision support environment for clinical trials,9143689,U01CA160045,"['Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Differentiation Therapy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Property', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical decision-making', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'predicting response', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2016,522865,0.027319782382621963
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9132242,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2016,169609,0.012780511474514249
"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9106828,R01AR068456,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,31678,0.01821495207873368
"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences.

"Computerized morphologic-molecular predictor of progression in DCIS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although molecular genetic approaches have become popular for tumor characterization, hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) morphology is still remarkably useful. In reality, tumor morphology reflects the sum of all molecular pathways in tumor cells, thereby providing incredible utility for predicting tumor biology, clinical behavior, nd treatment response. While the visual reading of such slides by pathologists can predict behavior, sophisticated histomorphometric analysis with computer-aided quantitation has the potential to ""unlock"" more revealing sub-visual attributes about tumors just from morphology. Some of these sub-visual features may encode for disease aggressiveness in histological (biopsy or resection) images of cancer. Additionally these sub-visual or ""histologic biomarkers"" can be correlated with disease recurrence independent of other clinical and pathologic features; and can be extracted via computerized image analysis. Recent analyses have shown that one of the major reasons for the ""over-diagnosis"" of breast cancer is the increased diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The current rate of DCIS diagnosis is 56 per 100,000 women (NEJM 2012). The standard of care for DCIS management is surgery followed by local radiation with the addition of endocrine therapy for lesions expressing estrogen receptor. This regimen brings the recurrence rates down from 25% (in untreated patients) to around 10%. Identification of which patients may benefit from treatment has been difficult because of the low incidence of adverse events necessitating long term followup. Molecular studies recently been performed by the Badve group (in collaboration with Genomic Health, Inc) on the E-5194 clinical trial, led to the development and commercialization of a molecular assay, the DCIS Score, which predicts the likelihood of development of ipsilateral DCIS and/or invasive cancer. However, the DCIS Score does not comprehensively account for disease heterogeneity since the assay was developed in a cohort considered low risk by clinicopathological characteristics; the performance of the assay in the ""real-world"" situation is not known. The focus of this project is t optimize and evaluate a multistain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which DCISs are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE). msCHIP employs digitized H&E and immunohistochemistry stained (Ki67, CD10 measuring cellular proliferation, vascularity) tissue sections, from which a series of features describing spatial distribution, morphology, texture and arrangement of tumor and stromal cell nuclei, and proliferative index will be extracted via advanced computer vision tools. Thus ""histologic biomarkers"" for more and less aggressive DCISs will be identified. The successful validation of msCHIP on a large cohort of 300 cases could pave the way for rapid adoption of msCHIP as an oncological decision support tool, providing critical information for more informed treatment decisions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to develop and evaluate a multi-stain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE). The successful validation of msCHIP could pave the way for its adoption as a decision support tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be ""de-escalated"" or specifically targeted in order to maintain favorable survival rates while minimizing the substantial (and long term) treatment-related morbidity and expense from surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.",Computerized morphologic-molecular predictor of progression in DCIS,9037632,R21CA195152,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellularity', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Ipsilateral', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Survival Rate', 'Texture', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disease heterogeneity', 'follow-up', 'genetic approach', 'histological image', 'hormone therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'indexing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,201504,-0.06344742905586993
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,9044803,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2016,63620,0.0018607228404499156
"Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. These designations of natural history assume great importance at a time when insights from preclinical studies are beginning to translate into therapies targeted at specific key pathways of fibrosis. Stratification of disease phenotypes is important in order to decipher the effects of newly approved therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individual patients.  Various prognostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with overall survival; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good early predictive models exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF from multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier on scans annotated manually by an expert radiologist, analyzing in separate aims static image features present on baseline scans and transitional (difference) morphologic features on sequential scans that herald progressive disease. Features of anatomic distribution will be explored and reproducible imaging features will be expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score. Aggregate prognostic models using Cox proportional regression models will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Finally, we will externally validate our models in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitia Lung Disease Program.  Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that anticipate disease course in patients with IPF. We anticipate that these models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions for the choice in treatment as well as future research to define more homogeneous cohorts for testing new safe and effective therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rates of progression are highly variable, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using newer drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to predict disease course in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.",Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns,9122467,R21HL123477,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hamman-Rich syndrome', 'Health', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stable Disease', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data archive', 'digital imaging', 'disease classification', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'effective therapy', 'functional decline', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2016,107290,0.0023322452091358095
"Analyzing Large-Scale Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease Analyzing Large-Scale Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract: Advances in imaging technology offer great opportunities to study Alzheimer's disease (AD) in many ways that are not previously possible. This leads to various large-scale imaging studies, i.e., ADNI, for discovering AD-related imaging biomarkers. In these imaging studies, image registration plays a key role in reducing the confounding inter-subject variability and also enhancing the statistical power of identifying abnormalities related to AD. However, automated processing of large-scale imaging data, i.e., involving anything from hundreds to thousands of 3D brain images, is not trivial and requires dedicated computational tools. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel deep multi-layer groupwise registration methods for effective, efficient and simultaneous registration of all brain images with possibly large anatomical and appearance differences. Also, to accommodate for new images acquired from the on-going large-scale imaging study, an efficient incremental groupwise registration method will be further developed to avoid time- and resource-consuming re-registration of all new and existing images from scratch. Our key idea is to break down the complex groupwise registration problem into hierarchical sets of small- scale registration tasks that can be solved easily, thus making the large-scale registration more manageable and fast. Specifically, 1) for fast initialization of large-scale groupwise registration of brain images, we will develop in Aim 1 a hierarchical learning-based landmark detection algorithm, based on random forest regression, to detect salient anatomical landmarks and then jointly align all images with detected landmarks. Since all images are distributed in a complex manifold and also the registration of similar images is much faster and more accurate, we propose to first build a graph to link each image only with similar images, and then formulate groupwise registration as dynamic graph shrinkage. This avoids direct registration of each image to the group-mean image as done in the conventional methods, thus improving both speed and accuracy. 2) To significantly speed up and also improve this single-layer graph-based groupwise registration, we will further develop in Aim 2 a deep multi-layer groupwise registration by simultaneous layer-by-layer graph construction and layer-wise registration. 3) Finally, to significantly increase both the speed and accuracy of registration for new images acquired from on-going large-scale imaging study, we will develop in Aim 3 a novel incremental groupwise registration method to reuse previous registration results of existing images for guiding registration of new images. Specifically, each new image can be quickly registered to the common space of existing images by finding its most similar existing image(s). Accordingly, all new and existing images will become similar in the common space and then can be quickly updated for their overall groupwise registration. All computational tools developed will be made freely available to the research community, for accelerating the imaging study of Alzheimer's disease. Narrative Description of Project Modern imaging techniques offer great opportunities to study Alzheimer's disease (AD) in many ways that are not previously possible. This leads to increasing number of large-scale imaging studies, including ADNI. However, the overwhelmingly big data poses new challenges to researchers in automated data processing. Thus, modern computational tools are expected to be able to handle the vast amount of data within a manageable time frame. In light of this, we aim to solve this large-scale spatial registration problem – a critical step directly related to accuracy and precision of imaging biomarkers to be discovered for AD. In particular, we will develop novel deep multi-layer groupwise registration methods for effective, efficient and simultaneous registration of all brain images with possibly large anatomical and appearance differences. Also, to accommodate for new images acquired from the on-going study, an efficient incremental groupwise registration will be further developed to avoid time- and resource-consuming re-registration of all new and existing images from scratch. The development of these advanced computational tools will eventually benefit for discovery of new imaging biomarkers for AD.",Analyzing Large-Scale Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease,9240850,RF1AG053867,"['Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Appearance', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Mainstreaming', 'Methods', 'Play', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'empowered', 'forest', 'image guided', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'rapid technique']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,RF1,2016,2485857,-0.06760215155713999
"Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and highest-grade astrocytoma with uniformly dismal prognosis. In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration. Therefore, it will present a broad impact on future translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated analysis of spatial configurations of tissue pathologic features and underlying molecular biomarkers accounting for cancer progression is an important way to understand tumor expansion mechanisms. To advance in this research field, I propose to develop automated image analysis tools, database-based spatial integration methods, and mathematical models for tumor microenvironment representation to support quantitative investigations on Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor invasion mechanisms with definitive pathology imaging and multiplexed molecular biomarker data from whole-slide images of GBM specimens.",Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol,9128413,K25CA181503,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytoma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'Location', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Necrosis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Dots', 'Radial', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Variant', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'computer science', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'genomic biomarker', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein expression', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'spatial integration', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K25,2016,117968,0.016154183692066032
"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,9119513,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multi-atlas segmentation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,597688,0.033809128808384374
"Motion Compensated Brain PET Imaging for Neuroscience Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced imaging technologies such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) have led to remarkable improvement in our knowledge of brain metabolism, function, and biochemistry. And yet, our understanding of most neurological disorders is at best rudimentary. Etiology of such common diseases as drug and alcohol addiction, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's remains elusive. Malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma continue being fatal. Changes happening in the brain in such common syndromes as hospital-acquired delirium, and post-operative cognitive decline, are not understood. Most studies involving advanced brain imaging remain small due to logistical challenges, cost constraints, and difficulty of scanning neurological patients in standard radiology equipment. Acceleration of brain research is required to elucidate the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Brain Biosciences was established to make neurological imaging comfortable, inexpensive, and widely available both in the clinic and in the research laboratory. One of the common problems encountered in imaging research is unintentional patient motion. Head movement during Positron Emission Tomography (PET) degrades PET image quality, leads to image artifacts, and introduces quantitative errors. Motion is particularly common in confused patients with neurological diseases, drug addiction, and movement disorders. This problem becomes especially relevant as research involving lengthy dynamic scans, and high-resolution brain imaging becomes common. While sedation is often used to minimize the patient motion, sedative drugs change brain biochemistry, interfere with radiopharmaceutical uptake, and may cause side effects. Physical restraints are often distressing, and may increase patient agitation. In this direct Phase II SBIR proposal we seek to develop, clinically validate, and receive FDA clearance for FREEMotion(tm), a video-based head tracking system, enabling motion- compensated brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of neurological patients without sedation or physical head restraint. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application proposes to develop and validate a novel head tracking system capable of compensating for patient motion during high-resolution brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. This device will lower improve the quality, comfort, and quantification of brain PET in patients with neurological and psychiatric diseases, as well as drug abuse.

"Ultra-miniaturized single fiber probe for functional brain imaging in freely moving animals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microscope techniques to image inside brain tissue are generally limited by poor depth penetration. Micro-endoscopy, wherein a probe is physically inserted into the tissue, can overcome this limitation in depth penetration, but at the expense of invasiveness and tissue damage due to the size of the probe. Our goal here is to palliate these problems by developing an ultra-miniature microendoscope probe based on a single, lensless optical fiber.  The direct transmission of an image through an optical ﬁber is diﬃcult because spatial information becomes scrambled upon propagation. We have recently demonstrated an image transmission strategy where spatial information is ﬁrst converted to spectral information. Our strategy is based on a principle of spread-spectrum encoding, borrowed from wireless communications, wherein object pixels are converted into distinct spectral codes that span the full bandwidth of the object spectrum. Image recovery is performed by numerical inversion of the detected spectrum at the ﬁber output. We have provided a simple demonstration of spread-spectrum encoding using macroscopic Fabry-Perot etalons. Our technique enables the 2D imaging of luminous (i.e. fluorescent or bioluminescent) objects with high throughput independent of pixel number. Moreover, it is insensitive to ﬁber bending, contains no moving parts, and opens the attractive possibility of extreme miniaturization down to the size of a single optical fiber.  Our goal here is to develop, characterize, and establish the versatility of a new class of ultra-miniature fiber probes that can provide functional 2D brain imaging at arbitrary depths and with minimal tissue damage. Our strategy will involve probe development, machine-learning algorithm development, and the actual demonstration of microendoscopic imaging in freely moving behaving animals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently demonstrated a strategy to image through a single, lensless optical fiber.

"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.            ",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,8953102,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2015,180330,0.045666973184301324
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits.

"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence. Therefore, it will pave the way for more refined and targeted treatments of peritumoral brain tissue, which is where most tumor recurrence occurs.",Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin,8915752,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infiltration', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'brain tissue', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'radiosensitizing', 'social', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'trend', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,541169,0.05322707496731564
"MRI brain morphometry for computer-aided detection of neurological disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The technology that is routinely available to neuroradiologists is years or decades behind that which is used in imaging research throughout the world. Current clinical decision-making in neuroradiology is based on information that is insufficient for detecting the subtle changes that presage clinically significant conditions such a a growing tumor, enlarging ventricle, or shrinking hippocampus.  Tools that are regularly used in research are not accessible in the clinic due to a number of factors: slow execution speed, sensitivity to scanner manufacturer, field strength and pulse sequence, and lack of FDA clearance. In this project we seek to remove these barriers by further developing FreeSurfer, the world's premier automated brain morphometry package, to (1) integrate novel deep-learning and Random Forest- based patch-matching image synthesis technology into FreeSurfer to make it robust to variations in scanner platform and acquisition parameters, (2) use modern parallel-processing to reduce execution time to a clinically-feasible length, and (3) obtain FDA clearance on the tools allowing them to be routinely used in direct patient care.  The resulting product would dramatically improve the information that neuroradiologists have access to for patient diagnosis, staging, and the assessment of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for disorders including AD, tumor, hydrocephalus, and epilepsy, to name a few.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology that is currently routinely available to neuroradiologists is years or decades behind that which is used in imaging research throughout the world.

"Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) is a consortium of centers developing quantitative image features, which are proving to be valuable biomarkers of the underlying cancer biology and that can be used for assessing response to treatment and predicting clinical outcome. It is now important to discover the best quantitative imaging features for detection of response to therapeutics, to identify subtypes of cancer, and to correlate with cancer genomics. However, progress is thwarted by the lack of shared software algorithms, architectures, and resources required to compute, compare, evaluate, and disseminate these quantitative imaging features within the QIN and the broader community. We propose to develop the Quantitative Imaging Feature Pipeline (QIFP), a cloud-based, open source platform that will give researchers free access to these capabilities and hasten the introduction of quantitative image biomarkers into single- and multi-center clinical trials. The QIFP will facilitate assessment of the incremental value of new vs. existing image feature sets. It will also allow researchers to add their own algorithms to compute novel quantitative image features in their own studies and to disseminate them to the greater research community. To accomplish this: (1) We will create an expandable library of quantitative imaging feature algorithms capable of comprehensive characterization of the imaging phenotype of cancer. It will support a broad set of imaging modalities and algorithms implemented in a variety of languages, including algorithms that provide volumetric and time-varying assessment of lesion size, shape, edge sharpness, and pixel statistics. (2) We will build a cloud-based software architecture for creating, executing, and comparing quantitative image feature-generating pipelines, including algorithms in the library and/or those supplied by QIN or other researchers as plug-ins. QIFP will also have (a) a machine learning engine that lets users specify a dependent variable (e.g., progression-free survival) that the quantitative image features can used to predict, and (b) an evaluation engine that compares the utility of particular features for predicting the dependent variable. (3) We will assess the QIFP in four ways: (a) by its ability to recapitulate the role of known biomarkers in a related clinical trial, (b) by comparing linear measurement, metabolic tumor burden and novel combinations of the features in our library for predicting one-year progression-free survival, (c) by merging imaging features with known host-, drug- and tumor-based follicular lymphoma biomarkers in order to develop the most robust and integrative predictive model for patient outcomes, and (d) by using the QIFP to combine and to evaluate image feature algorithms developed by another QIN team and our own NCI- funded team in the study of radiogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer. The QIFP will fill a substantial gap in the science currently being carried out in the QIN and in the community by providing the tools and infrastructure to assess the value of novel quantitative imaging features of cancer, and will thereby accelerate incorporating new imaging biomarkers into single and multi-center clinical trials and into oncology practice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop and evaluate a software platform that has major relevance for human health. Many investigators are pursuing image-based surrogates for response to therapy that could be used in clinical trials to predict their success/failure earlier and that are more accurate than existing surrogates. Our developments will facilitate sharing, assessing, and comparing combinations of image feature-generating software algorithms for predicting treatment response, survival, and tissue genomics, which will, in turn, greatly accelerate the development and acceptance of new and more relevant imaging surrogates for assessing cancer treatments.                ","Computing, Optimizing, and Evaluating Quantitative Cancer Imaging Biomarkers",8960049,U01CA187947,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Java', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Pythons', 'RNA Sequences', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Survival', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'cloud based', 'disorder subtype', 'image archival system', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vector', 'web based interface']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,652612,0.015208289015528108
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.            ",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9037783,R01NS095411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,572285,-0.0073591010852733256
"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals. The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.",Objective decision support environment for clinical trials,8926887,U01CA160045,"['Algorithms', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Differentiation Therapy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Property', 'Qualifying', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical decision-making', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'male', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2015,522865,0.027319782382621963
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.                ",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,8968015,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2015,169609,0.012780511474514249
"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences.

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics. n/a",Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy,8895855,U01CA140204,"['Albumins', 'Anatomy', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast Cancer therapy', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methionine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Systemic disease', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,658727,0.010372345673355132
"Histologic image-based aggressiveness prediction in p16+ oropharyngeal carcinoma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): By 2020 the number of patients with p16+ (HPV-related) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is predicted to surpass that for cervical SCC. Epidemiologists have termed this a head and neck cancer ""epidemic."" At the same time, there is an emerging view that we may be ""over-treating"" patients with p16+ (HPV-related) OSCC because it is typically more biologically indolent, with tumors having less gross chromosomal abnormalities, ~1/2 the gene mutation rate, and favorable responses to treatment. For these reasons, many speculate that therapies could be ""de-escalated"" to maintain favorable patient survival while minimizing treatment-related morbidity. However, a significant minority of patients with p16+ OSCC have aggressive disease that will recur, predominantly in the form of distant metastasis, resulting in death. There are currently few clinical-and no molecular-markers to discriminate more from less aggressive p16+ OSCC.  The focus of this project is to optimize and evaluate a quantitative histomorphometric (QH)-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to identify which p16+ OSCC are likely to be clinically aggressive and which OSCC patients have cancers that are very unlikely to recur. QuHbIC only requires digitized images of standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections, from which a series of features describing spatial distribution, morphology, texture and arrangement of tumor and stromal cell nuclei will be extracted via advanced computer vision and pattern recognition tools. Thus ""histologic biomarkers"" for more and less aggressive p16+ OSCC will be identified. Although molecular genetic approaches have become popular for tumor characterization, H&E morphology is still remarkably useful. In reality, tumor morphology reflects the sum of all molecular pathways in tumor cells, thereby providing incredible utility for predicting tumor biology, clinical behavior, and treatment response. While the visual reading of such slides by pathologists can predict behavior, sophisticated histomorphometric analysis with computer-aided quantitation has the potential to ""unlock"" more revealing information about tumors just from their morphology. The hypotheses underlying this project are that (a) markers for disease aggressiveness are encoded in visual attributes in histological (biopsy or resection) images of cancer, and some of these ""histologic biomarkers"" (e.g. nuclear anaplasia and/or multi-nucleation) can be correlated with disease recurrence independent of other clinical and pathologic features; and (b) these ""histologic biomarkers"" can be extracted via computerized image analysis.  QuHbIC will be trained and refined via a large cohort of digitized H&E slides with long term clinical follow up data from Washington University in St. Louis (Wash U). Independent evaluation of the classifier will be performed on scanned H&E slides available from both Wash U and Johns Hopkins University. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for rapid integration of QuHbIC into the clinical workflow as a decision support tool, providing critical information to assist oncologists in making more informed treatment decisions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to develop and evaluate a quantitative histomorphometric (QH)- based image classifier (QuHbIC) to identify which p16+ (HPV-related) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients (OSCC) are likely to have aggressive cancers and, perhaps even more importantly, for identifying which patients have cancers that are very unlikely to recur. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as a decision support tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be ""de-escalated"" or specifically targeted in order to maintain favorable survival rates while minimizing the substantial (and long term) treatment-related morbidity and expense from surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.",Histologic image-based aggressiveness prediction in p16+ oropharyngeal carcinoma,8923176,R21CA179327,"['Adoption', 'Anaplasia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Indolent', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nuclear', 'Oncologist', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Survival Rate', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'follow-up', 'genetic approach', 'imaging Segmentation', 'lymph nodes', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,203048,-0.008372090437310492
"Computerized morphologic-molecular predictor of progression in DCIS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although molecular genetic approaches have become popular for tumor characterization, hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) morphology is still remarkably useful. In reality, tumor morphology reflects the sum of all molecular pathways in tumor cells, thereby providing incredible utility for predicting tumor biology, clinical behavior, nd treatment response. While the visual reading of such slides by pathologists can predict behavior, sophisticated histomorphometric analysis with computer-aided quantitation has the potential to ""unlock"" more revealing sub-visual attributes about tumors just from morphology. Some of these sub-visual features may encode for disease aggressiveness in histological (biopsy or resection) images of cancer. Additionally these sub-visual or ""histologic biomarkers"" can be correlated with disease recurrence independent of other clinical and pathologic features; and can be extracted via computerized image analysis. Recent analyses have shown that one of the major reasons for the ""over-diagnosis"" of breast cancer is the increased diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The current rate of DCIS diagnosis is 56 per 100,000 women (NEJM 2012). The standard of care for DCIS management is surgery followed by local radiation with the addition of endocrine therapy for lesions expressing estrogen receptor. This regimen brings the recurrence rates down from 25% (in untreated patients) to around 10%. Identification of which patients may benefit from treatment has been difficult because of the low incidence of adverse events necessitating long term followup. Molecular studies recently been performed by the Badve group (in collaboration with Genomic Health, Inc) on the E-5194 clinical trial, led to the development and commercialization of a molecular assay, the DCIS Score, which predicts the likelihood of development of ipsilateral DCIS and/or invasive cancer. However, the DCIS Score does not comprehensively account for disease heterogeneity since the assay was developed in a cohort considered low risk by clinicopathological characteristics; the performance of the assay in the ""real-world"" situation is not known. The focus of this project is t optimize and evaluate a multistain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which DCISs are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE). msCHIP employs digitized H&E and immunohistochemistry stained (Ki67, CD10 measuring cellular proliferation, vascularity) tissue sections, from which a series of features describing spatial distribution, morphology, texture and arrangement of tumor and stromal cell nuclei, and proliferative index will be extracted via advanced computer vision tools. Thus ""histologic biomarkers"" for more and less aggressive DCISs will be identified. The successful validation of msCHIP on a large cohort of 300 cases could pave the way for rapid adoption of msCHIP as an oncological decision support tool, providing critical information for more informed treatment decisions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to develop and evaluate a multi-stain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE).

"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue identification and quantification plays a significant role in the study of aging and age-related diseases. For example, the accumulation of fat in the human body and its regional distribution with aging is associated with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in muscle composition are strongly linked to decline of muscle strength, decreased mobility caused by aging, or musculoskeletal disorders. Especially interesting is analysis of longitudinal changes of morphometric descriptors that is significant for studying the aging process and for the diagnosis and prevention of age-related diseases.  Medical imaging has emerged as a major tool for estimation of body composition mainly due to being non- invasive and producing multi-dimensional information. Nowadays MRI and CT acquisition is a central component of clinical trials. An abundance of imaging data is collected, but this wealth of information has not been utilized to full extent. Therefore research on image analysis techniques for tissue quantification that are reproducible and can be used on large-scale clinical trials is of particular importance.  The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse body composition data from modern MRI and CT imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative body composition phenotypes on clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who are healthy versus those who are not. The goal of our work is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the abdomen and lower extremities and to study the relationship between body morphological changes and age-related pathologies.  We will build upon recent advances in medical image computing to segment muscle, regional adipose tissue, and bone in clinical CT and MRI scans. We will also develop image registration procedures to achieve intra- and inter-subject correspondence and make efficient use of information provided by multi-modal and multi-temporal imaging data collected in clinical trials (aim 1). After these methods have been developed, we will address the hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging can increase the prognostic accuracy of age-related pathologies (aim2).          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related diseases such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia have become a worldwide epidemic and affect the quality of life of millions. To give a global perspective, roughly 343.8 million people in the world have type-2 diabetes today, and 175 million don't know they have diabetes at all. Metabolic diseases are strongly linked to longitudinal changes in body composition, morphology and function. This project will contribute novel and non-invasive medical image analysis techniques for studying the human body composition and its changes with increasing age to achieve timely prognosis of these pathologies.                 ",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR STUDIES OF AGING PHENOTYPES AND AGE-RELATED DISEASES,8854343,SC3GM113754,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delaware', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Techniques', 'Thigh structure', 'Tissues', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age related', 'biophysical model', 'bone', 'effective therapy', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'morphometry', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'sarcopenia', 'statistics', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,DELAWARE STATE UNIVERSITY,SC3,2015,63363,0.0018607228404499156
"Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology occurring in older adults. IPF is ultimately fatal with a median survival of 2 to 5 years, and exhibits a highly heterogeneous natural history. Broad categories of disease progression have been defined, but are not predictable at the time of diagnosis. These designations of natural history assume great importance at a time when insights from preclinical studies are beginning to translate into therapies targeted at specific key pathways of fibrosis. Stratification of disease phenotypes is important in order to decipher the effects of newly approved therapies among individuals with biologically dissimilar natural histories and to better tailor therapy to individual patients.  Various prognostic tools have been developed for IPF that correlate with overall survival; most use clinical and functional variables independent of imaging findings. Prognostic determinants based on imaging features rely largely on subjective visual assessment of disease. In contrast, no good early predictive models exist that anticipate the natural history of disease in advance of significant functional decline. Given the indispensable role of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in the diagnosis and surveillance of IPF, we propose to mine the rich information in HRCT data sets to develop robust, quantitative features that can anticipate disease progression in advance of debilitating respiratory compromise. We propose to use the anonymized clinical data and source images on 234 patients with IPF from multicenter trials, and whose data are archived at the UCLA Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers Laboratory. Using an image processing pipeline developed in our laboratory for quantitative image analysis, we will train a classifier on scans annotated manually by an expert radiologist, analyzing in separate aims static image features present on baseline scans and transitional (difference) morphologic features on sequential scans that herald progressive disease. Features of anatomic distribution will be explored and reproducible imaging features will be expressed with a quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score. Aggregate prognostic models using Cox proportional regression models will be derived using only clinical covariates and combined clinical and imaging covariates, correlating these models with progression free survival. Finally, we will externally validate our models in an independent institutional registry of clinical and image data on patients with IPF seen in the UCLA Interstitia Lung Disease Program.  Our objectives are centered on the goals of using preexisting datasets to develop clinically meaningful models that anticipate disease course in patients with IPF. We anticipate that these models can be used clinically at the individual patient level to enable more informed and timely management decisions for the choice in treatment as well as future research to define more homogeneous cohorts for testing new safe and effective therapies and to better elucidate the effects of therapies in patients with biologically heterogeneous disease progression.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of older adults that now has a few treatment options: The natural history of IPF and its rates of progression are highly variable, which hampers timely decisions about referral for lung transplantation or treatments using newer drug therapies. This research takes advantage of clinical and imaging datasets previously collected for research or clinical purposes, and will define image features using computer analysis of computed tomography (CT) images to predict disease course in advance of respiratory deterioration. The success of this research will enable us to distinguish between patients with slowly versus rapidly progressive disease, leading to more timely management decisions, and may help us to understand which patients might benefit from novel promising therapies or treatments and which may not.            ",Prediction of IPF Progression Using Imaging Patterns,8956609,R21HL123477,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hamman-Rich syndrome', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Natural History', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Progressive Disease', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Stable Disease', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'digital imaging', 'disease classification', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'effective therapy', 'functional decline', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'novel', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'respiratory', 'success', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2015,107290,0.0023322452091358095
"Quantitative Image Analysis Techniques for Optic Nerve Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disorders of the optic nerve (ON) account for a significant percentage of the 20 most impactful ophthalmological conditions. Collectively, diseases of the ON are the number one cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and present serious public health concerns in the U.S. Consider, for example, that glaucoma impacts more than three million Americans and costs the U.S. economy almost $3 billion per year. Optic neuritis (i.e., inflammatory demyelination of the ON) is the initial symptom in ~25% of all multipl sclerosis (MS) cases (which impacts over 400 thousand Americans and introduces societal health care costs of nearly $30 billion per year). Nearly two thirds of MS patients will experience episodes of optic neuritis in their lifetimes, and 40-60% of patients have visual defects localized to the ON. These disorders irreversibly damage the ON. Even so, damage to axons in the ON is progressive, defined by a window of opportunity for treatment between loss of function and actual degeneration. The potential for recovery exists because there are treatments that can help prevent progression if administered during this window of opportunity. Yet, we do not have effective means to assess who is in the window and who will benefit from treatment. We propose to translate computational imaging methods from the neuroimaging community to provide robust, quantitative tools for assessing the optic nerve (ON) on clinical and research imaging sequences. These efforts will improve prognostic accuracy, lead to better understanding of patient responses, and enhance targeted interventions. The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse ON data from modern MRI and CT clinical sequences. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative ON phenotypes on longitudinal clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who respond to treatment versus those who do not.  The overall goal of this research is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the ON and its relationships with pathological disorders. We will build upon recent advances in robust medical image computing to segment the ON in clinical CT and MRI acquisitions, develop registration procedures to establish intra- and inter-subject correspondence, and bring together information from the multi-modal battery of imaging studies that are typically used in clinical care (aim 1). With these new methods, we will address the exploratory hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging data can increase prognostic accuracy (aim 2). We note that aim 2 is particularly exploratory and in line with the high- risk/high-reward aspect of this mechanism; many studies have shown that baseline imaging does not conclusively predict long term outcome or treatment response. We hypothesize that this may be because early findings are related to edema and inflammation rather than cellular damage per se. Once this exploratory phase is complete, we will pursue promising prognostic biomarkers using more detailed condition staging criteria and including more than two longitudinal time points in the analysis. Ultimately, these efforts will improve assessment ON disease and, in turn, patient care.

"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary. Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience.

In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration. Therefore, it will present a broad impact on future translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated analysis of spatial configurations of tissue pathologic features and underlying molecular biomarkers accounting for cancer progression is an important way to understand tumor expansion mechanisms. To advance in this research field, I propose to develop automated image analysis tools, database-based spatial integration methods, and mathematical models for tumor microenvironment representation to support quantitative investigations on Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor invasion mechanisms with definitive pathology imaging and multiplexed molecular biomarker data from whole-slide images of GBM specimens.",Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol,8887315,K25CA181503,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytoma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'Location', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Necrosis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Dots', 'Radial', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Variant', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'molecular imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein expression', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'spatial integration', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K25,2015,117968,0.016154183692066032
"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images. By offering more accurate image-derived measurements, the project promises to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, reduce the costs of biomedical re- search studies and pharmaceutical trials, and accelerate scientific discovery.",Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation,8887334,R01EB017255,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'International', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myocardium', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aortic valve', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,591379,0.033809128808384374
"Motion Compensated Brain PET Imaging for Neuroscience Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced imaging technologies such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) have led to remarkable improvement in our knowledge of brain metabolism, function, and biochemistry. And yet, our understanding of most neurological disorders is at best rudimentary. Etiology of such common diseases as drug and alcohol addiction, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's dementia and Parkinson's remains elusive. Malignant brain tumors such as glioblastoma continue being fatal. Changes happening in the brain in such common syndromes as hospital-acquired delirium, and post-operative cognitive decline, are not understood. Most studies involving advanced brain imaging remain small due to logistical challenges, cost constraints, and difficulty of scanning neurological patients in standard radiology equipment. Acceleration of brain research is required to elucidate the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Brain Biosciences was established to make neurological imaging comfortable, inexpensive, and widely available both in the clinic and in the research laboratory. One of the common problems encountered in imaging research is unintentional patient motion. Head movement during Positron Emission Tomography (PET) degrades PET image quality, leads to image artifacts, and introduces quantitative errors. Motion is particularly common in confused patients with neurological diseases, drug addiction, and movement disorders. This problem becomes especially relevant as research involving lengthy dynamic scans, and high-resolution brain imaging becomes common. While sedation is often used to minimize the patient motion, sedative drugs change brain biochemistry, interfere with radiopharmaceutical uptake, and may cause side effects. Physical restraints are often distressing, and may increase patient agitation. In this direct Phase II SBIR proposal we seek to develop, clinically validate, and receive FDA clearance for FREEMotion(tm), a video-based head tracking system, enabling motion- compensated brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of neurological patients without sedation or physical head restraint.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application proposes to develop and validate a novel head tracking system capable of compensating for patient motion during high-resolution brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. This device will lower improve the quality, comfort, and quantification of brain PET in patients with neurological and psychiatric diseases, as well as drug abuse. The proposed device will have applications both in the clinic and neuroscience research.            ",Motion Compensated Brain PET Imaging for Neuroscience Research,9049061,R44DA040382,"['Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Agitation', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biochemistry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Calibration', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Delirium', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Electromagnetics', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluable Disease', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Freedom', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glioblastoma', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maryland', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Restraint', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Qualifying', 'Quality Control', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sedation procedure', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Design', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Vendor', 'base', 'brain metabolism', 'brain research', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'restraint', 'sedative', 'uptake']",NIDA,BRAIN BIO,R44,2015,911987,0.008930784892097227
"MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop an image-based diagnostic system for Glioblastoma (GBM) that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. This should facilitate the delivery of individualized care for patients with GBM. Current therapy selection is formulaic and uniform for all patients and does not account for broad genetic diversity that contributes to treatment resistance and dismal prognosis. Specifically, each patient's GBM is uniquely heterogeneous and comprised of multiple distinct subclonal populations with differing susceptibilities to therapy This diversity causes tumors to respond non-uniformly to targeted therapy and allows resistant clones to repopulate as recurrent disease. Additionally, conventional MRI routinely guides surgical resection of enhancing tumor core, but leaves behind tumor populations within adjacent non-enhancing parenchyma, or brain around tumor (BAT). The BAT represents the primary target of adjuvant therapy because it harbors the residual tumor populations that nearly universally recur. Curating the genomic diversity within BAT should inform treatment selection, but this region is almost never biopsied because it is poorly evaluated on conventional MRI. Currently, there is no systematic method that addresses intratumoral heterogeneity to characterize the regional genomic diversity within BAT. To address this critical need, this exploratory proposal will develop and test a novel mapping system that integrates multi-parametric MRI with image-guided tissue analysis and machine learning (ML) algorithms to delineate regional genomic variations in GBM. This system uses conventional MRI to identify major tumoral subcomponents: enhancing core, BAT, and central necrosis. Within these subcomponents, advanced MRI (perfusion, diffusion, texture) will further characterize regional tumor properties (i.e., angiogenesis, permeability, invasion, and proliferation) that represent phenotypic expression of underlying genomic status. These MRI traits will guide stereotactic biopsies from distinct tumoral subregions to generate matched pairs of MRI and genomic data. An ML algorithm will incorporate these data to estimate regional genomic diversity throughout each tumor, including BAT areas that have not been surgically sampled. We have unified a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from institutions that have substantial and long-standing collaborations. Our group offers expertise in multiple fields of study that are necessary to accomplish the research aims, including: 1) image processing and analytics; 2) image-guided stereotactic surgery and coregistration; 3) development of machine learning (ML) methodology; and 4) comprehensive genomic interrogation and cell biology of tumor within BAT. If successful, the work proposed here should significantly impact how GBM patients are diagnosed and treated. This potentially improves clinical outcomes by enabling a paradigm shift from ""one treatment fits all"" to a mutations-based approach that selects combinatorial therapies targeting individual tumor populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing an image-based mapping system that characterizes regionally diverse populations within individual tumors, the proposed exploratory work will facilitate the development of improved targeted combinatorial therapies as the basis for future work in an R01 application.             ",MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma,8620732,R21NS082609,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Necrosis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Injuries', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Biology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'War', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'comparative genomic hybridization', 'field study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R21,2014,219825,0.03349198754617886
"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence. Therefore, it will pave the way for more refined and targeted treatments of peritumoral brain tissue, which is where most tumor recurrence occurs.             ",Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin,8695890,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infiltration', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'brain tissue', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'statistics', 'trend', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2014,560015,0.05322707496731564
"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials     DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals.           The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.  .

"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional     DESCRIPTION: Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences.

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics.          n/a",Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy,8712174,U01CA140204,"['Albumins', 'Anatomy', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methionine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Systemic disease', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,641994,0.010372345673355132
"Histologic image-based aggressiveness prediction in p16+ oropharyngeal carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): By 2020 the number of patients with p16+ (HPV-related) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is predicted to surpass that for cervical SCC. Epidemiologists have termed this a head and neck cancer ""epidemic."" At the same time, there is an emerging view that we may be ""over-treating"" patients with p16+ (HPV-related) OSCC because it is typically more biologically indolent, with tumors having less gross chromosomal abnormalities, ~1/2 the gene mutation rate, and favorable responses to treatment. For these reasons, many speculate that therapies could be ""de-escalated"" to maintain favorable patient survival while minimizing treatment-related morbidity. However, a significant minority of patients with p16+ OSCC have aggressive disease that will recur, predominantly in the form of distant metastasis, resulting in death. There are currently few clinical-and no molecular-markers to discriminate more from less aggressive p16+ OSCC.  The focus of this project is to optimize and evaluate a quantitative histomorphometric (QH)-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to identify which p16+ OSCC are likely to be clinically aggressive and which OSCC patients have cancers that are very unlikely to recur. QuHbIC only requires digitized images of standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections, from which a series of features describing spatial distribution, morphology, texture and arrangement of tumor and stromal cell nuclei will be extracted via advanced computer vision and pattern recognition tools. Thus ""histologic biomarkers"" for more and less aggressive p16+ OSCC will be identified. Although molecular genetic approaches have become popular for tumor characterization, H&E morphology is still remarkably useful. In reality, tumor morphology reflects the sum of all molecular pathways in tumor cells, thereby providing incredible utility for predicting tumor biology, clinical behavior, and treatment response. While the visual reading of such slides by pathologists can predict behavior, sophisticated histomorphometric analysis with computer-aided quantitation has the potential to ""unlock"" more revealing information about tumors just from their morphology. The hypotheses underlying this project are that (a) markers for disease aggressiveness are encoded in visual attributes in histological (biopsy or resection) images of cancer, and some of these ""histologic biomarkers"" (e.g. nuclear anaplasia and/or multi-nucleation) can be correlated with disease recurrence independent of other clinical and pathologic features; and (b) these ""histologic biomarkers"" can be extracted via computerized image analysis.  QuHbIC will be trained and refined via a large cohort of digitized H&E slides with long term clinical follow up data from Washington University in St. Louis (Wash U). Independent evaluation of the classifier will be performed on scanned H&E slides available from both Wash U and Johns Hopkins University. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for rapid integration of QuHbIC into the clinical workflow as a decision support tool, providing critical information to assist oncologists in making more informed treatment decisions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to develop and evaluate a quantitative histomorphometric (QH)- based image classifier (QuHbIC) to identify which p16+ (HPV-related) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients (OSCC) are likely to have aggressive cancers and, perhaps even more importantly, for identifying which patients have cancers that are very unlikely to recur. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as a decision support tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be ""de-escalated"" or specifically targeted in order to maintain favorable survival rates while minimizing the substantial (and long term) treatment-related morbidity and expense from surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.            ",Histologic image-based aggressiveness prediction in p16+ oropharyngeal carcinoma,8756202,R21CA179327,"['Adoption', 'Anaplasia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Indolent', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nuclear', 'Oncologist', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Survival Rate', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'follow-up', 'imaging Segmentation', 'lymph nodes', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,185934,-0.008372090437310492
"Quantitative Image Analysis Techniques for Optic Nerve Disease  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Disorders of the optic nerve (ON) account for a significant percentage of the 20 most impactful ophthalmological conditions. Collectively, diseases of the ON are the number one cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and present serious public health concerns in the U.S. Consider, for example, that glaucoma impacts more than three million Ameri- cans and costs the U.S. economy almost $3 billion per year. Optic neuritis (i.e., inflammatory demyelination of the ON) is the initial symptom in ~25% of all multiple sclerosis (MS) cases (which impacts over 400 thousand Americans and intro- duces societal health care costs of nearly $30 billion per year). Nearly two thirds of MS patients will experience episodes of optic neuritis in their lifetimes, and 40-60% of patients have visual defects localized to the ON. These disorders irre- versibly damage the ON. Even so, damage to axons in the ON is progressive, defined by a window of opportunity for treatment between loss of function and actual degeneration. The potential for recovery exists because there are treatments that can help prevent progression if administered during this window of opportunity. Yet, we do not have effective means to assess who is in the window and who will benefit from treatment.  We propose to translate computational imaging methods from the neuroimaging community to provide ro- bust, quantitative tools for assessing the optic nerve (ON) on clinical and research imaging sequences. These efforts will improve prognostic accuracy, lead to better understanding of patient responses, and enhance targeted interven- tions. The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse ON data from modern MRI and CT clinical sequences. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative ON phenotypes on longitudinal clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who respond to treatment versus those who do not.  The overall goal of this research is to provide a foundation for image analysis of the ON and its relationships with pathological disorders. We will build upon recent advances in robust medical image computing to segment the ON in clinical CT and MRI acquisitions, develop registration procedures to establish intra- and inter-subject correspondence, and bring together information from the multi-modal battery of imaging studies that are typically used in clinical care (aim 1). With these new methods, we will address the exploratory hypothesis that quantitative use of clinical imaging data can increase prognostic accuracy (aim 2). We note that aim 2 is particularly exploratory and in line with the high- risk/high-reward aspect of this mechanism; many studies have shown that baseline imaging does not conclusively pre- dict long term outcome or treatment response. We hypothesize that this may be because early findings are related to edema and inflammation rather than cellular damage per se. Once this exploratory phase is complete, we will pursue promising prognostic biomarkers using more detailed condition staging criteria and including more than two longitudinal time points in the analysis. Ultimately, these efforts will improve assessment ON disease and, in turn, patient care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to translate medical imaging computing procedures from the neuroimaging community to provide robust, quantitative tools for assessing the optic nerve (ON) on clinical and research imaging sequences. The technical hypothesis of this work is that quantitative image processing can robustly and accurately segment, register, and fuse ON data from modern MRI and CT clinical sequences. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that qualitative ON phenotypes on longitudinal clinical imaging will differentiate individuals who respond to treatment versus those who do not more effectively than traditional pre-interventional measures.                ",Quantitative Image Analysis Techniques for Optic Nerve Disease,8620598,R21EY024036,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Demyelinations', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Gap Junctions', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurologic', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Injuries', 'Optic Neuritis', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Sclerosis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Swelling', 'Symptoms', 'Tars', 'Techniques', 'Thyroid Diseases', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tweens', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'direct application', 'experience', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'nerve decompression', 'neuroimaging', 'optic nerve disorder', 'outcome forecast', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'thyroid associated ophthalmopathies', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vector']",NEI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,225089,0.015355810554651175
"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.         Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.

"Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and highest-grade astrocytoma with uniformly dismal prognosis. In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration. Therefore, it will present a broad impact on future translational research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated analysis of spatial configurations of tissue pathologic features and underlying molecular biomarkers accounting for cancer progression is an important way to understand tumor expansion mechanisms. To advance in this research field, I propose to develop automated image analysis tools, database-based spatial integration methods, and mathematical models for tumor microenvironment representation to support quantitative investigations on Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor invasion mechanisms with definitive pathology imaging and multiplexed molecular biomarker data from whole-slide images of GBM specimens.            ",Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol,8618183,K25CA181503,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytoma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'Location', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Necrosis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Dots', 'Radial', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Variant', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'molecular imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'relational database', 'spatial integration', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K25,2014,116888,0.016154183692066032
"Adaptive Large-Scale Framework for Automatic Biomedical Image Segmentation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-atlas label fusion (MALF) is a powerful new technology that can automatically detect and label anatomical structures in biomedical images. It is arguably the most successful general-purpose automatic image segmentation technique ever developed. Automatic segmentation is in high demand in clinical and research applications of medical imaging, since segmentation forms a crucial step towards extracting quantitative information from imaging data, and since manual and semi-automatic approaches are ill suited for today's increasingly large and complex imaging datasets. Despite a number of papers that demonstrated outstanding performance of MALF methods across a range of biomedical imaging applications, the broader biomedical imaging research community has been slow to adopt this technique. This can be explained by multiple factors, including the technique's high computational demands, lack of a turnkey software implementation, as well as scarcity of validation in clinical imaging datasets and in the presence of extensive pathology. The present application seeks to remove these barriers and to enable a broad range of clinicians and biomedical researchers to take advantage of MALF technology. It builds on our strong track record of innovation in the MALF field, including a novel redundancy-correcting MALF technique that led in segmentation grand challenges in the past two years. Aim 1 seeks to improve the computational performance of MALF by replacing dense deformable image registration, by far the most time consuming component of MALF, with faster and less constrained sparse registration strategies. We hypothesize that this will not only reduce the computational cost of MALF, but will also make it more robust to anatomical variability, in particular enabling its use for tumor and lesion segmentation. Aim 2 proposes algorithmic extensions to MALF that support automatic segmentation of dynamic and multi-modality imaging datasets, which have been largely overlooked in the MALF literature. Aim 3 will develop a turnkey open-source implementation of MALF methodology. Taking advantage of cloud computing technology, this software will allow users with minimal image processing expertise to take full advantage of MALF segmentation on their desktop. Aim 3 will also provide a set of publicly available atlases and the means for users to build new custom atlas sets from their own data. Aim 4 will perform extensive evaluation of the new methods and software in challenging real-world clinical imaging data, including brain and cardiac imaging. As part of this evaluation, we will quantify how well our MALF approach and competing techniques generalize to novel imaging datasets with heterogeneity in acquisition parameters and clinical phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will make it possible for a wide community of researchers who collect and analyze medical imaging data to take advantage of a new class of computer algorithms that very accurately label and measure anatomical structures and pathological formations in medical images.

"MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop an image-based diagnostic system for Glioblastoma (GBM) that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. This should facilitate the delivery of individualized care for patients with GBM. Current therapy selection is formulaic and uniform for all patients and does not account for broad genetic diversity that contributes to treatment resistance and dismal prognosis. Specifically, each patient's GBM is uniquely heterogeneous and comprised of multiple distinct subclonal populations with differing susceptibilities to therapy This diversity causes tumors to respond non-uniformly to targeted therapy and allows resistant clones to repopulate as recurrent disease. Additionally, conventional MRI routinely guides surgical resection of enhancing tumor core, but leaves behind tumor populations within adjacent non-enhancing parenchyma, or brain around tumor (BAT). The BAT represents the primary target of adjuvant therapy because it harbors the residual tumor populations that nearly universally recur. Curating the genomic diversity within BAT should inform treatment selection, but this region is almost never biopsied because it is poorly evaluated on conventional MRI. Currently, there is no systematic method that addresses intratumoral heterogeneity to characterize the regional genomic diversity within BAT. To address this critical need, this exploratory proposal will develop and test a novel mapping system that integrates multi-parametric MRI with image-guided tissue analysis and machine learning (ML) algorithms to delineate regional genomic variations in GBM. This system uses conventional MRI to identify major tumoral subcomponents: enhancing core, BAT, and central necrosis. Within these subcomponents, advanced MRI (perfusion, diffusion, texture) will further characterize regional tumor properties (i.e., angiogenesis, permeability, invasion, and proliferation) that represent phenotypic expression of underlying genomic status. These MRI traits will guide stereotactic biopsies from distinct tumoral subregions to generate matched pairs of MRI and genomic data. An ML algorithm will incorporate these data to estimate regional genomic diversity throughout each tumor, including BAT areas that have not been surgically sampled. We have unified a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from institutions that have substantial and long-standing collaborations. Our group offers expertise in multiple fields of study that are necessary to accomplish the research aims, including: 1) image processing and analytics; 2) image-guided stereotactic surgery and coregistration; 3) development of machine learning (ML) methodology; and 4) comprehensive genomic interrogation and cell biology of tumor within BAT. If successful, the work proposed here should significantly impact how GBM patients are diagnosed and treated. This potentially improves clinical outcomes by enabling a paradigm shift from ""one treatment fits all"" to a mutations-based approach that selects combinatorial therapies targeting individual tumor populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing an image-based mapping system that characterizes regionally diverse populations within individual tumors, the proposed exploratory work will facilitate the development of improved targeted combinatorial therapies as the basis for future work in an R01 application.             ",MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma,8490147,R21NS082609,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Necrosis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Injuries', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Biology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'War', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'comparative genomic hybridization', 'field study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R21,2013,305251,0.03349198754617886
"Developing a Platform for Prediction of Metastasis Using Multiplexed QD-imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexed biomarker analysis is more powerful in reflecting the biological behaviors of a tumor than single biomarker analysis, but its standardization and quantification is still a challenge. Furthermore, most computer software does not provide methods for imaging and analyzing subcellular localization of biomarkers and correlating them with biological and clinical information. The objective of this project is to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantification of multiplexed immunostaining plus bioinformatics for the prediction of lymph node metastases (LNM) from the primary tumor (PT) of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). LNM of SCCHN is a precisely defined biological phenomenon which is an ideal model to be utilized to develop this multiplexed biomarker platform (MBP). Based on our preliminary studies, we aim to test the hypothesis that that the MBP can be developed to identify the subcellular distribution and expression of multiple metastasis-related biomarkers simultaneously in PTs. Accurate quantification of these biomarkers will facilitate the prediction of metastasis from PTs. Three emerging technologies, quantum dot (QD)-based immunohistofluorescence (IHF), multispectral imaging, and machine learning will be used to test this hypothesis. Using these approaches, a platform that combines quantifying multiplexed immunostaining with biostatistics will be developed and tested for its sensitivity, specificity, and prediction power for use in the clinic. Therefore, this project fits appropriately to the scope of the NCI program announcement ""Developmental Research in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction"" (PA-09-159).  Three aims are proposed in the study. (1) To develop a multiplexed biomarker system and method based on a bulk tissue model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissues. This Aim will establish and validate an analysis methodology for multiplexed quantification of membrane and cytoplasmic staining using a new function in InForm software where subcellular localization of certain biomarkers will be specifically analyzed. Prediction of LNM based on this bulk tissue model will be achieved. (2) To develop a per-cell quantification method based on a sub-population model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissue.  The per-cell analysis results will quantified as the percentage of high risk cells from the multiplexed biomarker analyses in the same PTs. The high risk population will be correlated with LNM. The sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the sub-population model will be compared with that of the bulk tissue model. (3) To develop and validate a nomogram with software combining clinical characterizations of metastasis as a working platform for the prediction of LNM. While the primary endpoint of Aim 1 and 2 is to correlate the three biomarkers with metastasis, other clinical factors such as differentiation status, tumor stage, and site, etc. may also correlate with LNM. The most predictive biomarker set combined with relevant clinical factors will constitute a platform with computer software that will be validated in an additional 100 SCCHN samples for prediction of LNM.        Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application. This project aims to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantifying multiplexed biomarkers plus their correlation with lymph node metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. This platform can be used for an assessment of LNM which is paramount for appropriate treatment planning.

"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials     DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way.

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.

"Statistical methods for large and complex databases of ultra-high-dimensional  Abstract Medical imaging is a cornerstone of basic science and clinical practice. To discover new mechanisms and markers of disease and their crucial implications for clinical practice, large multi-center imaging studies are acquiring terabytes of complex multi-modality imaging data cross-sectionally and longitudinally over decades. The statistical analysis of data from such studies is challenging due to the complex structure of the imaging data acquired and the ultra-high dimensionality. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of anatomy, pathology, and imaging protocols causes instability and failure of many current state-of-the-art image analysis methods. This grant proposes statistical frameworks for studying populations through biomedical imaging, scalable and robust methods for the identification and accurate quantification of pathology, and analytic tools for the cross-sectional and longitudinal examination of etiology and disease progression. These techniques will be applied to address key goals of the motivating large and multi- center studies of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and across the globe. The project will create methods for uncovering and quantifying brain lesion pathology, incidence, and trajectory. Methods developed under this grant will be targeted towards these neuroimaging goals, but will form the basis for statistical image analysis methods applicable broadly in the biomedical sciences.

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics.          n/a",Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy,8532654,U01CA140204,"['Albumins', 'Anatomy', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methionine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Systemic disease', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2013,625194,0.010372345673355132
"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.

"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.         Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.

In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.  .            ",Objective decision support environment for clinical trials,8369358,U01CA160045,"['Algorithms', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Differentiation Therapy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Property', 'Qualifying', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical decision-making', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'male', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2012,578313,0.02323298998995252
"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia.",Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging,8292033,R01AG011378,"['6-hydroxybenzothiazole', 'Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inositol', 'Label', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'population based', 'primary outcome', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2012,934653,0.006783698833489231
"Developing a Platform for Prediction of Metastasis Using Multiplexed QD-imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexed biomarker analysis is more powerful in reflecting the biological behaviors of a tumor than single biomarker analysis, but its standardization and quantification is still a challenge. Furthermore, most computer software does not provide methods for imaging and analyzing subcellular localization of biomarkers and correlating them with biological and clinical information. The objective of this project is to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantification of multiplexed immunostaining plus bioinformatics for the prediction of lymph node metastases (LNM) from the primary tumor (PT) of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). LNM of SCCHN is a precisely defined biological phenomenon which is an ideal model to be utilized to develop this multiplexed biomarker platform (MBP). Based on our preliminary studies, we aim to test the hypothesis that that the MBP can be developed to identify the subcellular distribution and expression of multiple metastasis-related biomarkers simultaneously in PTs. Accurate quantification of these biomarkers will facilitate the prediction of metastasis from PTs. Three emerging technologies, quantum dot (QD)-based immunohistofluorescence (IHF), multispectral imaging, and machine learning will be used to test this hypothesis. Using these approaches, a platform that combines quantifying multiplexed immunostaining with biostatistics will be developed and tested for its sensitivity, specificity, and prediction power for use in the clinic. Therefore, this project fits appropriately to the scope of the NCI program announcement ""Developmental Research in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction"" (PA-09-159).  Three aims are proposed in the study. (1) To develop a multiplexed biomarker system and method based on a bulk tissue model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissues. This Aim will establish and validate an analysis methodology for multiplexed quantification of membrane and cytoplasmic staining using a new function in InForm software where subcellular localization of certain biomarkers will be specifically analyzed. Prediction of LNM based on this bulk tissue model will be achieved. (2) To develop a per-cell quantification method based on a sub-population model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissue.  The per-cell analysis results will quantified as the percentage of high risk cells from the multiplexed biomarker analyses in the same PTs. The high risk population will be correlated with LNM. The sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the sub-population model will be compared with that of the bulk tissue model. (3) To develop and validate a nomogram with software combining clinical characterizations of metastasis as a working platform for the prediction of LNM. While the primary endpoint of Aim 1 and 2 is to correlate the three biomarkers with metastasis, other clinical factors such as differentiation status, tumor stage, and site, etc. may also correlate with LNM. The most predictive biomarker set combined with relevant clinical factors will constitute a platform with computer software that will be validated in an additional 100 SCCHN samples for prediction of LNM.        Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application. This project aims to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantifying multiplexed biomarkers plus their correlation with lymph node metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. This platform can be used for an assessment of LNM which is paramount for appropriate treatment planning.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment. Pilot studies on the feasibility of this approach to larger clinical studies will be performed on a database of brain MR images obtained from glioma patients via a rich and extensive acquisition protocol, including perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscopy, and conventional imaging.           n/a",Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?,8230636,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Conformal Radiotherapy', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Edema', 'Excision', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Wolves', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'gray matter', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'programs', 'soft tissue', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2012,337641,0.047672878871348336
"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management.

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics.          n/a",Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy,8334502,U01CA140204,"['Albumins', 'Anatomy', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methionine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Systemic disease', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2012,668129,0.010372345673355132
"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.

"Molecular Characterization of Parotid Gland Tumors  7. Project Summary/Abstract  Salivary gland tumors constitute 1-6% of head and neck tumors numbering 3600 new cases per year in the US. Though rare, there are 37 histopathological malignant subtypes and 13 benign subtypes of salivary gland tumors, making it one of the most challenging tumors to diagnose. While surgery is the main modality of treatment, advance unresectable primary, recurrent and metastatic tumors are generally fatal. The rarity of the tumors and multiple histopathological subtypes generated major clinical challenges for the early detection, diagnosis, therapeutic interventions and prognosis of patients with salivary gland tumors.  This application addresses the missing gaps in salivary gland tumor research by advancing the basic and translational sciences. Our approach is to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of salivary gland tumors using the most advanced omics technologies coupled with advanced data and bioinformatics analysis to develop tissue-based biomarkers for salivary gland malignancy detection as well as the potential use of salivary biomarkers to screen/risk assess symptomatic patients for salivary gland malignancies. In additional a systems network analysis approach (Weighted-Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis, WGCNA) will be use to examine the derived omics databases to identify pivotal molecular pathways and gene targets for salivary gland malignancy development. Collective these approaches will lead to translational and mechanistic insights for salivary tumor development that can be further translated for clinical applications as well as mechanistic evaluations using rodent models for salivary gland carcinogenesis.  Six Specific Aims are in place to test the hypothesis in this application. Aim 1 is to procure fresh frozen malignant and benign parotid gland tissues from the UCLA Head & Neck Oncology Clinic. Aim 2 is to perform comprehensive profiling of parotid gland tumors' transcriptome; microRNA and epigenome using most advanced RNA sequencing and methylomics arrays. Aim 3 will perform statistical and bioinformatics analysis for the omics databases to select candidate biomarkers that can detect parotid gland malignancies. These candidate biomarkers will be pre-validated in Aim 4 in an independent cohort of parotid gland malignant and benign tumors. Aim 5 is to explore the hypothesis that tissue-based dysregulated biomarkers in malignant parotid glands are concordantly dysregulated in saliva of these patients. Finally Aim 6 is a systems network based analysis of the omics databases to identify critical biological pathways and gene targets that are pivotal in the development of parotid gland malignancies. These pathway and targets outcome can be evaluated in future mechanistic studies in salivary gland malignancy development by rodent models or cell lines.  Our multidisciplinary research team has the expertise and track record to carry out the proposed molecular characterization of parotid gland tumors as well as expertise to carryout the mechanistic and translational next steps to fully materialize the goals of this RFA.  8. Relevance to Public Health Statement  Salivary gland tumors are rare. However, they are aggressive and fatal. Due to its rarity (1-6% of head and neck cancers) and the fact that there are 24 variants of salivary gland cancers and 13 variants of benign subtypes, clinical diagnosis of salivary gland tumor is one of the worst, hampering treatment decisions and prognostics outcomes of patients. This application takes the novel and impactful approach to generate the most comprehensive molecular profile of salivary gland tumors to develop molecular signatures of salivary gland malignancies, saliva based biomarkers for early detection of salivary gland cancers and informatics outcomes that will identify critical biological pathways and gene targets that are involved in the mechanistic development of salivary gland malignancies. The outcomes of this application are molecular signatures of parotid gland cancer to assist clinical diagnosis; salivary biomarkers to assist early detection of salivary gland cancers and identified biological pathways and gene targets for mechanistic evaluation in rodent models for salivary gland tumor carcinogenesis.",Molecular Characterization of Parotid Gland Tumors,8534892,R56DE023241,"['Abbreviations', 'Acinar Cell Carcinoma', 'Address', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma', 'Adenolymphoma', 'Basic Science', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Head and neck structure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of salivary gland', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Otolaryngology', 'Outcome', 'Parotid Cancer', 'Parotid Gland', 'Parotid Neoplasms', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Public Health', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent Model', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms', 'Salivary Glands', 'Screening procedure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'abstracting', 'adenoma', 'antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity', 'base', 'biobank', 'bisulfite', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'insight', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R56,2012,211387,-0.01537571768396735
"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.         Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment. Pilot studies on the feasibility of this approach to larger clinical studies will be performed on a database of brain MR images obtained from glioma patients via a rich and extensive acquisition protocol, including perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscopy, and conventional imaging.           n/a",Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?,8020024,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Conformal Radiotherapy', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Edema', 'Excision', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Wolves', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'gray matter', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'programs', 'soft tissue', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2011,337641,0.047672878871348336
"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia. n/a",Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging,8117482,R01AG011378,"['6-hydroxybenzothiazole', 'Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inositol', 'Label', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'population based', 'primary outcome', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2011,968365,0.006326025551883371
"Developing a Platform for Prediction of Metastasis Using Multiplexed QD-imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiplexed biomarker analysis is more powerful in reflecting the biological behaviors of a tumor than single biomarker analysis, but its standardization and quantification is still a challenge. Furthermore, most computer software does not provide methods for imaging and analyzing subcellular localization of biomarkers and correlating them with biological and clinical information. The objective of this project is to develop a platform which combines imaging and quantification of multiplexed immunostaining plus bioinformatics for the prediction of lymph node metastases (LNM) from the primary tumor (PT) of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). LNM of SCCHN is a precisely defined biological phenomenon which is an ideal model to be utilized to develop this multiplexed biomarker platform (MBP). Based on our preliminary studies, we aim to test the hypothesis that that the MBP can be developed to identify the subcellular distribution and expression of multiple metastasis-related biomarkers simultaneously in PTs. Accurate quantification of these biomarkers will facilitate the prediction of metastasis from PTs. Three emerging technologies, quantum dot (QD)-based immunohistofluorescence (IHF), multispectral imaging, and machine learning will be used to test this hypothesis. Using these approaches, a platform that combines quantifying multiplexed immunostaining with biostatistics will be developed and tested for its sensitivity, specificity, and prediction power for use in the clinic. Therefore, this project fits appropriately to the scope of the NCI program announcement ""Developmental Research in Cancer Prognosis and Prediction"" (PA-09-159).  Three aims are proposed in the study. (1) To develop a multiplexed biomarker system and method based on a bulk tissue model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissues. This Aim will establish and validate an analysis methodology for multiplexed quantification of membrane and cytoplasmic staining using a new function in InForm software where subcellular localization of certain biomarkers will be specifically analyzed. Prediction of LNM based on this bulk tissue model will be achieved. (2) To develop a per-cell quantification method based on a sub-population model for prediction of LNM in SCCHN PT tissue.  The per-cell analysis results will quantified as the percentage of high risk cells from the multiplexed biomarker analyses in the same PTs. The high risk population will be correlated with LNM. The sensitivity and specificity of the prediction by the sub-population model will be compared with that of the bulk tissue model. (3) To develop and validate a nomogram with software combining clinical characterizations of metastasis as a working platform for the prediction of LNM. While the primary endpoint of Aim 1 and 2 is to correlate the three biomarkers with metastasis, other clinical factors such as differentiation status, tumor stage, and site, etc. may also correlate with LNM. The most predictive biomarker set combined with relevant clinical factors will constitute a platform with computer software that will be validated in an additional 100 SCCHN samples for prediction of LNM.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Imaging and quantifying expression and subcellular localization of multiplexed biomarkers is currently a challenge in cancer research and clinical application.

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management.

"Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancers are heterogeneous in biology among patients, tumors in the same patient, and within tumors. As a result, they respond differently to therapy per patient, per tumor and within tumors. Different radiotracers and imaging modalities provide information about different aspects of biology and the physio-metabolic environments of the cancer. As a result, a single modality or radiotracer may not provide sufficient information to predict or assess response to therapy. We hypothesize that improved prediction and assessment of response can thus be obtained by combining quantitative image-derived parameters obtained from multiple imaging modalities or radiotracers. We propose to develop, optimize, and validate approaches for combining multiple image-derived parameters obtained from quantitative imaging procedures in order to optimally predict and assess treatment response. In particular, we propose to combine quantitative metrics from PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and MRI. We will first individually optimize the protocols, acquisition parameters, and imaging methods in order to get the most accurate and reliable parameters to combine. Optimally combining the parameters from different modalities requires knowledge of the reproducibility (precision) of the individual quantitative imaging parameters. We will thus use literature search, phantom studies, realistic simulations, and repeated patient studies to characterize the accuracy and precision of the individual quantitative imaging methods. We will then develop methods to combine the metrics to predict or assess treatment response per patient, per tumor and intra-tumor. We will apply and evaluate these methods in three clinical trials: dynamic and static FDG and FIT PET/CT to assess lung cancer response to cytotoxic chemotherapy; PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI in breast cancer response; and SPECT/CT, PET/CT and DCE- and DW-MRI to predict response of brain tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy. In these trials imaging parameters and their signatures will be linked to histology or survival outcomes to provide validation of the combined imaging parameter metrics.          n/a",Multi-Modality Quantitiative Imaging for Evaluation of Response to Cancer Therapy,8188738,U01CA140204,"['Albumins', 'Anatomy', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Animal Model', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methionine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Systemic disease', 'Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate', 'Therapeutic', 'Tracer', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'text searching', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2011,671728,0.010372345673355132
"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.              Synopsis  Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.

"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience.

"A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A decade ago when microarray was first invented, it was hailed as ""an array of hope"" in Nature Genetics and has received a considerable amount of attention in biomedicine. Subsequently it has been called ""an array of problems"" in Nature Review. An inherent problem with microarray gene expression is that structural information is missing, which limits its ability in biological discovery. To overcome the poor reproducibility and accuracy of microarray imaging, there needs to be a shift in fundamental paradigms to those able to incorporate complementary and multiscale structural imaging information into microarray imaging. Fortunately, the latest progress in high resolution biomolecular imaging probe development coupled with advanced image analysis makes integrative and systematic studies of cellular systems possible. A cell can be labeled using multiscale and multimodality imaging, providing both structural and functional information. With multiscale imaging spreadsheets now available, there is an overwhelming need within the life sciences community to manage this information effectively, to analyze it comprehensively, and to apply the resulting knowledge in the understanding of the genetic system of a cell. However, the management and mining of this large-scale imaging information is limited by today's computational approaches and knowledge-sharing infrastructure. These problems represent a major impediment to progress in the emerging area of bio-molecular image informatics. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a unique genomic image management and mining system that can allow geneticists to search, correlate and integrate this multiscale and multi-modality imaging information in an easily operable fashion and further enable new biological discovery. In particular, this system will fill a void left in the current image database systems such as Open Microscope Environment (OME), e.g., the lack of analytic tools for integrative data analysis. To realize this goal, we are bringing together a strong interdisciplinary team consisting of imaging engineers, geneticists and industrial imaging scientists. Building on our diverse and complementary expertise, we are able to provide innovative and interdisciplinary approaches that combine the latest progress in image processing, imaging database design and machine learning with the development of high resolution and high throughput molecular imaging probes in genomics. More specifically, we will accomplish the following specific aims. First, we will develop a suite of algorithms for content extraction and information retrieval from high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images. This visual system will effectively manage imaging phenotype information, facilitating knowledge discovery such as identifying visually similar subtypes. Second, we will correlate quantitative traits extracted from FISH imaging with genomic structural rearrangements and gene expression patterns. Finally, we will develop a data integration approach to fuse disparate information from multi-modality imaging databases for improved characterization of biological systems.               Public Health Relevance Statement The anticipated outcome of the project will include a publicly accessible imaging database analysis system to facilitate multiscale genomic image information integration and knowledge mining. The proposed approach challenges the current paradigm by the integration of high resolution structural imaging with functional information, which promises to overcome the poor accuracy and reproducibility problems plagued with microarray imaging. Given the ubiquitous use of microarray imaging in biomedicine, the project is thus expected to be of great impact on the biomedical community.",A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets,7845601,R21LM010042,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Blast Cell', 'Cells', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Comb animal structure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Coupled', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Hybridization Array', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Karyotype', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Microscope', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Prevention', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'complex biological systems', 'data integration', 'database design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder prevention', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'image processing', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'knowledge of results', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'mutant', 'public health relevance', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'trait', 'visual map']",NLM,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2010,186306,0.05589124540332347
"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment. Pilot studies on the feasibility of this approach to larger clinical studies will be performed on a database of brain MR images obtained from glioma patients via a rich and extensive acquisition protocol, including perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscopy, and conventional imaging.           n/a",Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?,7760605,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Conformal Radiotherapy', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Edema', 'Excision', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Wolves', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'programs', 'soft tissue', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2010,341087,0.047672878871348336
"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia. n/a",Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging,7894558,R01AG011378,"['6-hydroxybenzothiazole', 'Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inositol', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'population based', 'primary outcome', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2010,1034999,0.006326025551883371
"Computer Assisted Identification and Volumetric Analysis of Enhancing Components    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of volumetric change of enhancing tissue is regarded as an important parameter used by clinicians when seeking to monitor the response of brain neoplasms to therapy. Unfortunately, direct computation of enhancing volume requires the manual tracing and segmentation of areas of enhancement typically extending over multiple images, which is time consuming, labor intensive, and therefore impractical. Substitute methods are widely utilized (such as bi-directional measurements). Such surrogate measurements for tumor volume become problematic. Our long-term goal is to seek an objective, computer aided diagnostic (CAD) methodology for automatic computation of tumor (enhancing tissue) volume relevant for clinical decision making. Our hypothesis behind this project is that volume of enhancing tissue can be accurately measured through the use of advanced computer vision techniques, which will lead to an effective CAD system able to assist radiologists analyzing MR brain images.   The specific aims of the proposed project are 1) to improve the accuracy of the measurement of enhancing tissue by constructing high resolution 3D MR images and labeling enhancing tissue using learning based computer vision techniques, and 2) to develop a CAD system for enhancing tissue volume assessment using the designed techniques and evaluate the performance of the system on assisting radiologists for image interpretation.    We believe this system will be well suited for use in patients undergoing treatment protocols/clinical trials who require short term serial imaging. It will better enable radiologists to give accurate quantitative clinical information. If the proposed research is completed successfully, the determination of enhancing tissue volume will be significantly advanced. It will enable the radiologists to rapidly provide objective, accurate, reproducible, and easily reported assessment of the tumor status. This will lead to a more rapid and reproducible assessment of neoplasm and therefore, hopefully influence patient outcomes in a positive way. The proposed research will also be applicable for usage on archived studies thereby enabling the volume of enhancing tissue to be calculated on these images as well.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to develop a more accurate and reproducible way to measure the amount of disease present in patients suffering from brain tumors. Measurement methods currently being used are limited in accuracy, reproducibility and efficiency and hence we propose a method, if successful, will enable the computer to identify and measure brain tumors in a more automated fashion with improved accuracy. Improvements in tumor volume assessment are important for treatment planning as well as for assessing response during clinical drug trials.            Project Narrative  The goal of this research is to develop a more accurate and reproducible way to measure the amount of disease present in patients suffering from brain tumors.

"Reliable Human-Model Observers for Emission Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall objective is to develop numerical observers for dependable technology evaluations in emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are the primary clinical modalities for imaging many types of cancer. However, early de- tection often presents the best chances of surviving cancer whereas these imaging modalities have limited diagnostic utility for small tumors. Systematic task-based developmental assessments could facilitate early identification of promising new technology for improving the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities. Yet, assessments with human observers are generally impractical for developmental use. Moreover, available mathematical models (or numerical observers) intended to predict human performance-what we refer to as human-model observers-present significant limits, including con- straints on the types of diagnostic tasks that can be considered. Partly because of these constraints, existing human-model observers frequently require revalidation given any change to the imaging pro- cess. Our approach to observer development is founded on the concept of task equivalence, whereby the task for the numerical observer mirrors the desired clinical task as closely as possible. In this grant, we propose a novel observer framework that is influenced by descriptions of radiologists' visual-search (VS) processes, in which an initial global scan of an image identifies candidate locations deserving closer inspection. We shall use the VS paradigm to investigate the hypotheses that task equivalence i) can lead to a human-observer model that reliably generalizes to a wide range of diagnostic tasks, and ii) is necessary to ensure truly relevant task-based evaluations. We shall test these hypotheses through observer studies with fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG) whole-body PET and SPECT In-111 imaging of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). A state-of-the-art model observer for developmental stud- ies should be capable of detection-localization tasks, and our observer studies will be analyzed with jackknife FROC (JAFROC) methodology. The specific aims of this work are to: 1) determine what features of FDG-PET image slices attract initial human-observer attention; 2) develop a VS numerical observer for tumor detection-localization tasks in FDG-PET; 3) test the VS observer against humans in a JAFROC detection-localization study featuring hybrid PET images; 4) investigate generalizations of the VS observer to SPECT and 3D detection-localization tasks; and 5) compare system optimiza- tions for oncologic SPECT obtained from the VS and existing numerical observers. The application is optimization of a parallel-hole collimator design for In-111 NET imaging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomog- raphy (SPECT) has a significant role in cancer diagnosis and management. Still, early detection offers the best chances for surviving many cancers and refining the diagnostic capabilities of these modali- ties for small tumors continues to be a major research focus.

This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7904306,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'premature', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,48929,0.02594279396767643
"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.              Synopsis  Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.

"Multiresolution-fractal modeling for brain tumor detection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI's long-term research goal is to develop a fully functional automated robust CAD tool for accurate  pediatric brain tumor volume segmentation and tracking over time. Note the current practice in brain tumor  volume segmentation involves manual tracing and segmentation of suspected tumor areas in multimodality MRI  which is time consuming, labor intensive, and may be imprecise.  In an effort to reduce cognitive sequelae, contemporary protocols employ risk-adapted therapy in which risk  stratification is based on volume of residual tumor after surgical resection and presence of metastatic disease at  diagnosis. Therefore, further improvement in cancer treatment outcome in children is unlikely to be achieved  without improved knowledge of tumor volume and classification among other factors. In addition, such automated  volume computation and tracking tool would be of value as an adjunct marker in following up patients with brain  tumors. This will, in turn, help the physicians to make important patient management decisions about surgery  planning, critical radiation treatment planning modifications, treatment field modifications, localized control, sites  of metastatic disease and post therapy response evaluation.  However, development of such automated and precise tumor volume segmentation CAD tool requires solution to  a few challenges such as detection of hard-to-detect brain tumor (small residual after surgery, poorly  enhanced, multi foci and irregularly shaped) and abnormalities (edema, necrosis, and larger resection  cavity due to surgery) detection and classification. This project aims at development, testing, and evaluation  of innovative techniques and tools that will assist feature-based detection, segmentation and classification of  brain tumor and a few specific abnormalities.} The specific aims of this project are: 1) Spline-multiresolution  wavelet-fractal feature extraction; 2) MR sequence-dependant feature fusion and tumor/abnormality size and  volume determination for improved detection; 3) Optimized feature fusion for improved tumor, tissue and  abnormality classification; and 4) Algorithm testing and validation. {If successful, our method will allow for the  automatic computation of brain tumors and abnormalities with improved accuracy, which can provide a rapid,  objective, reproducible, and easily reported assessment of the disease. The results obtained from this project will  have immediate impact in pediatric neuroradiology practice by providing an accurate, objective, and consistent  way to evaluate and interpret brain tumors and associated abnormalities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims at development, testing, and evaluation of novel feature-based algorithms for robust, accurate  and reproducible brain tumor and other abnormalities detection and classification.

"Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise tumor diagnosis and classification is the first step in cancer management. While many tumor biopsies are diagnostic and form the cornerstone of cancer therapy, classification of tumor type and site of origin, is an ever-present clinical challenge. It is estimated that up to 10% of all tumors have no defined primary site of origin and that thousands of dollars are spent per case to identify the site of origin with limited overall success. The current standard of pathologic practice, using morphologic criteria and a panel of semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, is often limited in its capacity to define tumor type or site of origin. Moreover, the diagnosis of metastatic lesions can be quite difficult when no primary site of origin has been identified (unknown primary cancers). Since therapy is often based on site of origin, there is a clear need for the identification and validation of a classifier that will cleanly distinguish these histologically similar tumor types and augment standard pathological techniques in making the diagnostic call. We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of using gene expression profiling to discriminate 21 different tumor types with an accuracy of 88%. The performance of this classifier, however, was principally limited by the use of multiple platforms for analysis. This proposal seeks to build a new gene expression classifier on a single, commercially available, genome-wide oligonucleotide platform, with a focus on the most problematic primary and metastatic tumors of the liver. To demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach, we plan to validate the classifier with independent test sets that will also be profiled by standard IHC approaches; the results of molecular classification will then be compared head to head with standard pathological classification for accuracy of diagnosis. To further translate the technology, we will select core classifier genes and perform validation with real time quantitative PCR. Finally, the molecular classifiers will be tested using prospectively acquired biopsy samples on tissues of known and unknown sites of origin.           n/a",Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors,7903971,R01CA112215,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Antibodies', 'Biliary', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast', 'Cancer Center', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Line', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon', 'Colon Adenocarcinoma', 'Community Hospitals', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Endoscopy', 'Ensure', 'Esophageal', 'Esophagus', 'Evaluation', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hepatic', 'Histologic', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metastatic Adenocarcinoma', 'Metastatic Lesion', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Microfluidics', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pancreas', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stomach', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'bile duct', 'cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'performance site', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,H.

"A New Paradigm for Integrated Analysis of Multiscale Genomic Imaging Datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A decade ago when microarray was first invented, it was hailed as ""an array of hope"" in Nature Genetics and has received a considerable amount of attention in biomedicine. Subsequently it has been called ""an array of problems"" in Nature Review. An inherent problem with microarray gene expression is that structural information is missing, which limits its ability in biological discovery. To overcome the poor reproducibility and accuracy of microarray imaging, there needs to be a shift in fundamental paradigms to those able to incorporate complementary and multiscale structural imaging information into microarray imaging. Fortunately, the latest progress in high resolution biomolecular imaging probe development coupled with advanced image analysis makes integrative and systematic studies of cellular systems possible. A cell can be labeled using multiscale and multimodality imaging, providing both structural and functional information. With multiscale imaging spreadsheets now available, there is an overwhelming need within the life sciences community to manage this information effectively, to analyze it comprehensively, and to apply the resulting knowledge in the understanding of the genetic system of a cell. However, the management and mining of this large-scale imaging information is limited by today's computational approaches and knowledge-sharing infrastructure. These problems represent a major impediment to progress in the emerging area of bio-molecular image informatics. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a unique genomic image management and mining system that can allow geneticists to search, correlate and integrate this multiscale and multi-modality imaging information in an easily operable fashion and further enable new biological discovery. In particular, this system will fill a void left in the current image database systems such as Open Microscope Environment (OME), e.g., the lack of analytic tools for integrative data analysis. To realize this goal, we are bringing together a strong interdisciplinary team consisting of imaging engineers, geneticists and industrial imaging scientists. Building on our diverse and complementary expertise, we are able to provide innovative and interdisciplinary approaches that combine the latest progress in image processing, imaging database design and machine learning with the development of high resolution and high throughput molecular imaging probes in genomics. More specifically, we will accomplish the following specific aims. First, we will develop a suite of algorithms for content extraction and information retrieval from high resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) images. This visual system will effectively manage imaging phenotype information, facilitating knowledge discovery such as identifying visually similar subtypes. Second, we will correlate quantitative traits extracted from FISH imaging with genomic structural rearrangements and gene expression patterns. Finally, we will develop a data integration approach to fuse disparate information from multi-modality imaging databases for improved characterization of biological systems.               Public Health Relevance Statement The anticipated outcome of the project will include a publicly accessible imaging database analysis system to facilitate multiscale genomic image information integration and knowledge mining. The proposed approach challenges the current paradigm by the integration of high resolution structural imaging with functional information, which promises to overcome the poor accuracy and reproducibility problems plagued with microarray imaging.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase.

"Accurate detection of chromosomal abnormalities with multi-color image processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The combination of high resolution assays in genomics with microscopic imaging has been used for the detection of complex chromosomal rearrangements, a significant but difficult problem in prenatal and postnatal diagnosis, birth defect detection and cancer research. As a recently developed molecular cytogenetic technique, multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) imaging has provided rapid and high resolution detection of chromosomal abnormalities associated with cancer and genetic disorders. However, the technique is currently limited to research use and only serves as an adjunct tool to the G-banding based monochromatic chromosomal karyotyping in a clinical laboratory. A primary barrier of the technique is the lower classification accuracy when classifying chromosomes from multi-color microscopic imaging data. Therefore, the goal of this R15 project is to develop innovative multi-spectral image processing and machine learning techniques for M-FISH image analysis so that chromosomal rearrangement detection can be made more reproducible, robust, and faster, thereby significantly increasing the ability and efficacy of this newly developed cellular imaging technique. Our proposed approaches such as multiscale feature extraction, nonlinear manifold analysis and adaptive fuzzy clustering are able to target specific features of multi-spectral imaging data, promising a significant improvement over the current techniques. In order to validate the technique and bring it into clinical use, we will partner with a clinical geneticist, Dr. Merlin Butler, and a cytogeneticist, Dr. Diane Persons both at Kansas University Medical Center. In addition, we will collaborate with an industrial scientist, Dr. Kenneth Castleman, who is the pioneer in developing and commercializing cytogenetic imaging products. Through our interdisciplinary research and collaboration, we will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) develop image normalization approaches to improve the acquisition of multi-color FISH images; 2) develop multiscale dimension analysis to extract features from multi-color images; 3) design adaptive fuzzy clustering and incorporate contextual information to improve the pixel-wise classification of chromosomes; and 4) validate computational approaches with clinical testing in collaboration with medical and industrial partners. This research project will also enhance our research infrastructure in biomedical image informatics and provide undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to touch the frontier of molecular and cellular imaging by participating in the proposed research activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unraveling complex rearrangements using cytogenetic approaches such as M-FISH imaging has been extremely useful in prenatal, postnatal and cancer diagnoses. Our proposed approaches have the potential to significantly improve the reliability of the newly developed M-FISH imaging technique, making it feasible for clinical use. This will in turn benefit the health of human beings. Furthermore, the developed computational techniques can be applicable to a wide range of multi-color bio-imaging problems, thereby having a broad impact on the biomedical community.           Project Narrative Unraveling complex rearrangements using cytogenetic approaches such as M-FISH imaging has been extremely useful in prenatal, postnatal and cancer diagnoses.

"Computer Assisted Identification and Volumetric Analysis of Enhancing Components    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of volumetric change of enhancing tissue is regarded as an important parameter used by clinicians when seeking to monitor the response of brain neoplasms to therapy. Unfortunately, direct computation of enhancing volume requires the manual tracing and segmentation of areas of enhancement typically extending over multiple images, which is time consuming, labor intensive, and therefore impractical. Substitute methods are widely utilized (such as bi-directional measurements). Such surrogate measurements for tumor volume become problematic. Our long-term goal is to seek an objective, computer aided diagnostic (CAD) methodology for automatic computation of tumor (enhancing tissue) volume relevant for clinical decision making. Our hypothesis behind this project is that volume of enhancing tissue can be accurately measured through the use of advanced computer vision techniques, which will lead to an effective CAD system able to assist radiologists analyzing MR brain images.   The specific aims of the proposed project are 1) to improve the accuracy of the measurement of enhancing tissue by constructing high resolution 3D MR images and labeling enhancing tissue using learning based computer vision techniques, and 2) to develop a CAD system for enhancing tissue volume assessment using the designed techniques and evaluate the performance of the system on assisting radiologists for image interpretation.    We believe this system will be well suited for use in patients undergoing treatment protocols/clinical trials who require short term serial imaging. It will better enable radiologists to give accurate quantitative clinical information. If the proposed research is completed successfully, the determination of enhancing tissue volume will be significantly advanced. It will enable the radiologists to rapidly provide objective, accurate, reproducible, and easily reported assessment of the tumor status. This will lead to a more rapid and reproducible assessment of neoplasm and therefore, hopefully influence patient outcomes in a positive way. The proposed research will also be applicable for usage on archived studies thereby enabling the volume of enhancing tissue to be calculated on these images as well.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to develop a more accurate and reproducible way to measure the amount of disease present in patients suffering from brain tumors. Measurement methods currently being used are limited in accuracy, reproducibility and efficiency and hence we propose a method, if successful, will enable the computer to identify and measure brain tumors in a more automated fashion with improved accuracy. Improvements in tumor volume assessment are important for treatment planning as well as for assessing response during clinical drug trials.            Project Narrative  The goal of this research is to develop a more accurate and reproducible way to measure the amount of disease present in patients suffering from brain tumors.

"Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Obesity has reached epidemic levels in the U.S., with 66% of adults overweight and 32% of adults obese. The research uses the new technique of three-dimensional  (3 D) photonic scanning to create and validate an instrument that  rapidly  assesses  obesity  in  clinical  and  field  settings.  The  first  aim  is  to develop a portable computer vision system of body imaging for 3 D surface imaging of the human body. The hardware system is designed from off-the- shelf components such as digital cameras, projectors, and personal computer. Algorithms for the 3D data are being developed and refined for calculation and system calibration for a small instrument. The second aim is to develop algorithms for surface reconstruction from 3D data in order to define a proper surface representation and to reconstruct a 3D model of the human body from incomplete and noisy data. The third aim begins the human measurement testing in 120 adults. Aim 3 is to estimate the size and shape of the reconstructed human body by a portable body imager and compare to current methods that assess obesity. Anthropometric parameters will be computed by a 3 second body scan via imaging and then compared to other methods of obesity assessment including BMI, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, bioimpedence, hydrodensitometry, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and air displacement plethysmography. The final aim is to validate body imaging as an indicator of central obesity (fat in the abdominal region, as opposed to subcutaneous depots) in a subset of 60 subjects because it is the abdominal fat that is most associated with health risks such as diabetes. Abdominal fat tissue as detected by magnetic resonance imaging scans will be compared to that calculated from 3 D body imaging.

"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7668441,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'premature', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,275279,0.02594279396767643

"Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors PROVIDED.  Precise tumor diagnosis and classification is the first step in cancer management. While many tumor biopsies are diagnostic and form the cornerstone of cancer therapy, classification of tumor type and site of origin, is an ever-present clinical challenge.

"Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging tool but many important clinical applications are limited by long scan times and/or poor SNR. This proposal aims to improve the speed of MRI without losing SNR, through a Bayesian inference approach. Improvement in scan speed can enable new time-critical clinical and diagnostic MR applications, like cardiac imaging, time-resolved 4D coronary angiography, high-resolution volumetric brain imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced imaging, etc. A Bayesian framework for the reconstruction of raw MR data from multiple coils in parallel will be developed. This framework makes it possible to reduce the time taken during scanning multiple times by reducing the sampling rate of raw MR data. Our method will be generally applicable to most MR imaging modalities, targets and sampling schemes. Our method will then be validated and tested on the specific clinical application of volumetric structural brain imaging, which is an important procedure for the detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, tumors, white matter lesions, measuring brain atrophy and hippocampal subfields, etc. The main goal of this project is to create a set of computational tools to perform the reconstruction of accelerated MRI data on arbitrary imaging targets, modalities and acquisition schemes, including random sampling schemes. Design of models to capture prior spatial information about images will be undertaken. Finally, the method will be validated on structural brain data in terms of metrics like SNR, partial voluming, test- retest repeatability, and the performance of subsequent processing steps like image segmentation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to make clinical MR imaging much faster than currently possible. This will make many time-critical clinical applications of MRI more feasible, for instance real-time MRI of the heart. The resolving power of MRI to image finer, clinically interesting anatomical features will also increase, making more reliable diagnosis possible.          n/a",Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S,7688029,R21EB008138,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'expectation', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'model design', 'nervous system disorder', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tumor', 'white matter']",NIBIB,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2009,211250,0.05333367684970871
"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment. Pilot studies on the feasibility of this approach to larger clinical studies will be performed on a database of brain MR images obtained from glioma patients via a rich and extensive acquisition protocol, including perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscopy, and conventional imaging.           n/a",Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?,7369127,R01NS042645,"['Aggressive course', 'Aging', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Conformal Radiotherapy', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Edema', 'Excision', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infiltration', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'image registration', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2008,344531,0.047672878871348336
"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects.

"Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Obesity has reached epidemic levels in the U.S., with 66% of adults overweight and 32% of adults obese. The research uses the new technique of three-dimensional  (3 D) photonic scanning to create and validate an instrument that  rapidly  assesses  obesity  in  clinical  and  field  settings.  The  first  aim  is  to develop a portable computer vision system of body imaging for 3 D surface imaging of the human body. The hardware system is designed from off-the- shelf components such as digital cameras, projectors, and personal computer. Algorithms for the 3D data are being developed and refined for calculation and system calibration for a small instrument. The second aim is to develop algorithms for surface reconstruction from 3D data in order to define a proper surface representation and to reconstruct a 3D model of the human body from incomplete and noisy data. The third aim begins the human measurement testing in 120 adults. Aim 3 is to estimate the size and shape of the reconstructed human body by a portable body imager and compare to current methods that assess obesity. Anthropometric parameters will be computed by a 3 second body scan via imaging and then compared to other methods of obesity assessment including BMI, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, bioimpedence, hydrodensitometry, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and air displacement plethysmography. The final aim is to validate body imaging as an indicator of central obesity (fat in the abdominal region, as opposed to subcutaneous depots) in a subset of 60 subjects because it is the abdominal fat that is most associated with health risks such as diabetes. Abdominal fat tissue as detected by magnetic resonance imaging scans will be compared to that calculated from 3 D body imaging. In sum, the non-contact, noninvasive nature of this new portable body scanner will produce a quick, inexpensive and objective measure of body size and type of obesity.             n/a",Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity,7495057,R21DK081206,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Body Image', 'Body Size', 'Body fat', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Height', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Personal Computers', 'Plethysmography', 'Population Study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Skeletal system', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Sum', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'abdominal fat', 'design', 'digital', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'photonics', 'reconstruction', 'size', 'subcutaneous', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'waist circumference']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2008,15000,0.01699790713048171
"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7469332,R01NS055064,"['Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evolution', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant Development', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurological outcome', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Range', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'neonate', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,275279,0.02594279396767643
"In-vivo optical molecular imaging with Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DyCE)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fluorescence-based molecular Imaging in small animals is having a major impact on drug development and disease research. However, a significant challenge to imaging targeted fluorescent markers in vivo remains: unless the labeled regions are located superficially; localization, quantitation and host organ identification are impeded by the effects of light scattering and absorption. Orthotopic tumor and disease models are increasingly preferred over less biologically relevant subcutaneous xenografts. In such studies, substantial difficulties are encountered in longitudinal studies where animals are growing and are positioned differently for each measurement. We believe that a single imaging advance could address many of these issues, and advance the utility of in-vivo molecular imaging: an exact anatomical co-registration technique that does not rely on multimodal techniques. This proposal describes dynamic molecular imaging (DMI), an approach that can provide co-registered anatomical information by exploiting in-vivo pharmacokinetics of dyes in small animals in a simple and inexpensive way. We demonstrate that by acquiring a time-series of optical images during injection of an inert dye, we can repeatably and accurately delineate the major internal organs of mice using optical imaging alone. This is possible because each major organ is ""illuminated"" by the kinetics of dye passing through it in such a manner as to make it distinguishable from other structures. Spatiotemporal analysis can exploit these characteristic time courses to allow the body-surface representation of each organ to be visualized. These in- vivo anatomical maps can be overlaid onto simultaneously acquired images of a targeted molecular probe (detected and distinguished from the mapping dye via multispectral imaging techniques, if necessary) to significantly aid in identification of the probe's anatomical and physical location. Using CRi's existing and prototype 2D, ""2.5D"" and true 3D multispectral mouse imaging systems, we propose to test and refine a DMI approach. Based on our findings to date, we will examine and exploit in-vivo pharmacokinetics of the near-infrared dye, indocyanine green, to generate delineated surface projections of individual organs. Co-registering this surface map with surface projections of detected targeted labels will allow the targeted probe's 3D spatial location to be inferred. This information can further be used to improve quantitative accuracy in longitudinal molecular imaging studies of deep targets.           n/a",In-vivo optical molecular imaging with Dynamic Contrast Enhancement (DyCE),7485551,R43EB008627,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Body Surface', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Dyes', 'Fluorescence', 'General Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Indocyanine Green', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Animal Imaging Systems', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Visualization software', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Xenograft procedure', 'absorption', 'base', 'blind', 'data acquisition', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrumentation', 'light scattering', 'longitudinal animal study', 'millimeter', 'molecular imaging', 'novel strategies', 'optical imaging', 'photonics', 'prototype', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'subcutaneous', 'tumor']",NIBIB,CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH AND INSTRUMENTATION,R43,2008,167462,0.05021181008720277
"Chip Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise tumor diagnosis and classification is the first step in cancer management. While many tumor biopsies are diagnostic and form the cornerstone of cancer therapy, classification of tumor type and site of origin, is an ever-present clinical challenge. It is estimated that up to 10% of all tumors have no defined primary site of origin and that thousands of dollars are spent per case to identify the site of origin with limited overall success. The current standard of pathologic practice, using morphologic criteria and a panel of semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, is often limited in its capacity to define tumor type or site of origin. Moreover, the diagnosis of metastatic lesions can be quite difficult when no primary site of origin has been identified (unknown primary cancers). Since therapy is often based on site of origin, there is a clear need for the identification and validation of a classifier that will cleanly distinguish these histologically similar tumor types and augment standard pathological techniques in making the diagnostic call. We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of using gene expression profiling to discriminate 21 different tumor types with an accuracy of 88%. The performance of this classifier, however, was principally limited by the use of multiple platforms for analysis. This proposal seeks to build a new gene expression classifier on a single, commercially available, genome-wide oligonucleotide platform, with a focus on the most problematic primary and metastatic tumors of the liver. To demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach, we plan to validate the classifier with independent test sets that will also be profiled by standard IHC approaches; the results of molecular classification will then be compared head to head with standard pathological classification for accuracy of diagnosis. To further translate the technology, we will select core classifier genes and perform validation with real time quantitative PCR.

"Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in imaging have revolutionized the biomedical investigation of illness. The tremendous potential that this methodology brings to advancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and in treatment of illnesses has as yet remained largely an unfulfilled promise. This potential has been limited by a number of technological impediments that could be in large part overcome by the availability of a federated imaging database and the attendant infrastructure. Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,7467385,U24RR021382,[' '],NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U24,2008,5140823,0.03217947972251925
"Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging tool but many important clinical applications are limited by long scan times and/or poor SNR. This proposal aims to improve the speed of MRI without losing SNR, through a Bayesian inference approach. Improvement in scan speed can enable new time-critical clinical and diagnostic MR applications, like cardiac imaging, time-resolved 4D coronary angiography, high-resolution volumetric brain imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced imaging, etc. A Bayesian framework for the reconstruction of raw MR data from multiple coils in parallel will be developed. This framework makes it possible to reduce the time taken during scanning multiple times by reducing the sampling rate of raw MR data. Our method will be generally applicable to most MR imaging modalities, targets and sampling schemes. Our method will then be validated and tested on the specific clinical application of volumetric structural brain imaging, which is an important procedure for the detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, tumors, white matter lesions, measuring brain atrophy and hippocampal subfields, etc. The main goal of this project is to create a set of computational tools to perform the reconstruction of accelerated MRI data on arbitrary imaging targets, modalities and acquisition schemes, including random sampling schemes. Design of models to capture prior spatial information about images will be undertaken. Finally, the method will be validated on structural brain data in terms of metrics like SNR, partial voluming, test- retest repeatability, and the performance of subsequent processing steps like image segmentation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to make clinical MR imaging much faster than currently possible. This will make many time-critical clinical applications of MRI more feasible, for instance real-time MRI of the heart. The resolving power of MRI to image finer, clinically interesting anatomical features will also increase, making more reliable diagnosis possible.          n/a",Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S,7528771,R21EB008138,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Blur', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pulse taking', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'expectation', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'model design', 'nervous system disorder', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tumor', 'white matter']",NIBIB,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2008,252375,0.05333367684970871
"Spectral imaging for automated malignant blast counting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We propose to extend our successful development of an agile spectral light source for light microscopy, funded through the NCI-IMAT initiative, into FDA trials. The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision. After blasts are identified, flow-cytometrylike software will present the data in histograms and other modalities, allowing the user to ""gate"" on particular cellular populations and pull up panels of cell images for confirmation.      Time-line: Final equipment-related tasks will be accomplished in the first year and preliminary testing of the instrumentation and software features will occur in the second year, as will development of qualified panels of immunoreagents and staining protocols (by DAKOCytomation).

"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods. Clinical evaluation will be conducted in a real-world teleconsultation environment in a before/after study design using two performance metrics: 1) the time required for consultations; and 2) the effect on the quality of the consultations. n/a",A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure,7272822,R01EB002247,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Body of uterus', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Condition', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Oncologist', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Slice', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teleconsultations', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Upper arm', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'health care quality', 'image registration', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'size', 'telehealth']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2007,394864,0.008509637939674047
"Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Obesity has reached epidemic levels in the U.S., with 66% of adults overweight and 32% of adults obese. The research uses the new technique of three-dimensional  (3 D) photonic scanning to create and validate an instrument that  rapidly  assesses  obesity  in  clinical  and  field  settings.  The  first  aim  is  to develop a portable computer vision system of body imaging for 3 D surface imaging of the human body. The hardware system is designed from off-the- shelf components such as digital cameras, projectors, and personal computer. Algorithms for the 3D data are being developed and refined for calculation and system calibration for a small instrument. The second aim is to develop algorithms for surface reconstruction from 3D data in order to define a proper surface representation and to reconstruct a 3D model of the human body from incomplete and noisy data. The third aim begins the human measurement testing in 120 adults. Aim 3 is to estimate the size and shape of the reconstructed human body by a portable body imager and compare to current methods that assess obesity. Anthropometric parameters will be computed by a 3 second body scan via imaging and then compared to other methods of obesity assessment including BMI, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, bioimpedence, hydrodensitometry, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and air displacement plethysmography. The final aim is to validate body imaging as an indicator of central obesity (fat in the abdominal region, as opposed to subcutaneous depots) in a subset of 60 subjects because it is the abdominal fat that is most associated with health risks such as diabetes. Abdominal fat tissue as detected by magnetic resonance imaging scans will be compared to that calculated from 3 D body imaging. In sum, the non-contact, noninvasive nature of this new portable body scanner will produce a quick, inexpensive and objective measure of body size and type of obesity.             n/a",Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity,7337256,R21DK081206,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Body Image', 'Body Size', 'Body fat', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Height', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Personal Computers', 'Plethysmography', 'Population Study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Skeletal system', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Sum', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'abdominal fat', 'design', 'digital', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'photonics', 'reconstruction', 'size', 'subcutaneous', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'waist circumference']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2007,15000,0.01699790713048171
"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome.

"Sono-Contrast Induced Functional Imaging/Spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    An innovative method of in vivo imaging for detection and pathophysiological classification of relatively superficial malignancies is proposed. The technique, sono-contrast induced functional imaging and spectroscopy (SCIFIS), builds upon existing diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) in the near infrared region but uses standing wave focused ultrasound deposition as a contrast agent to improve the sensitivity and specificity of DRS. The overall goal is to develop a non-invasive, real-time modality for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and post-treatment surveillance.   The basis of the proposed in vivo imaging method is that acoustic radiation force delivered by focused ultrasound forming a standing wave causes reversible compression of the vasculature and/or blood flow stasis, and thus temporal changes in hemoglobin concentration, which are registered in the dynamic (pre- and post-insonification) observation of near-infrared spectra. By intersecting the optical path and the acoustic path at an angle and subtracting measured spectra pre- and post-deposition of sono-contrast, signatures of vascular pathophysiology can be identified at the intersecting location.   In the R21 phase, C3H mice inoculated with murine mammary tumors on the left legs will undergo in vivo SCIFIS measurement prior to immunohistochemical examination. Principal component analysis neural networks (PCANN) will be used in data analysis/correlation, leading to definitively tests of the underlying hypotheses via receiver operating characteristics analysis and statistical correlation of tumor detection and vascular distribution predictions.   In the R33 phase, clinical evaluation of the SCIFIS technique will commence following system optimization by Monte Carlo simulation. Non-invasive, in vivo acquisition of SCIFIS spectra will be collected in patients undergoing biopsy for suspicion of breast cancers.

"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods.

"Spectral imaging for automated malignant blast counting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We propose to extend our successful development of an agile spectral light source for light microscopy, funded through the NCI-IMAT initiative, into FDA trials. The SpectraLamp(tm) device enables the automated and quantitative analysis of double-immunostained samples in brightfield (non-fluorescence-based) microscopy, with particular utility for hematopathology applications. A clinically compelling area is the enumeration of malignant blasts in bone marrow biopsy specimens of patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myleloproliferative diseases for the purpose of staging and evaluating therapeutic responses. Current methods are inadequate due to poor sampling (typical of bone marrow aspirates) or difficulty in identifying true blasts (bone marrow biopsies and single-color immunohistochemical phenotyping). Double-immunophenotyping permits largely unambiguous detection, but such labeling strategies are not supported by standard (non-multispectral) color imaging systems. To overcome this limitation, we will combine our multispectral imaging system with a high-speed slide-scanning platform that can scan an entire bone-marrow biopsy at high resolution in under 3 minutes. Machine-learning software tools and spectral imaging will identify blasts, combining morphology parameters and double or even triple immunophenotyping to ensure accuracy and precision.

"High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and neonates is a key factor in early detection of developmental disorders. This project proposal seeks to develop and refine novel magnetic resonance image reconstruction and analysis methodology to allow, for the first time, the mapping of in-utero fetal brain development. One of the most common abnormalities detected by clinical imaging of the developing fetal brain is ventriculomegaly, which, despite the absence of other clinical or imaging findings, is associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities in infancy and childhood in up to 50% of cases. Although ultrasound allows diagnosis of the condition, it has not been able to distinguish those fetus that will have poor neurological outcome from those with normal outcome. Recent developments in fast magnetic resonance imaging have permitted the use of MRI to study the fetal anatomy and this technique is now being routinely used at a small number of sites around the world including UCSF. However, MR imaging of the fetal brain is still challenging because of imaging distortions caused by motion of the fetus within the mother and by artifacts caused by the surrounding maternal anatomy. Higher resolution or 3D acquisitions are not possible because of motion of the fetus during the acquisition time^ required. The current clinical 2D slice data individually provide limited resolution and contrast and, most importantly, often contain severe motion corruption between slices. This project is motivated by the observation that it is possible to apply computer vision and image processing techniques to correct relative motion between the multiple stacks of low resolution fetal slices, and create a single volumetric image with high isotropic 3D resolution and consistent geometry. Such higher resolution images provide structure that may be analyzed using computational morphometric techniques that can detect subtle focal differences in the pattern of tissue volume, location and surface folding. This project will combine such powerful techniques with extensive fetal and neonatal imaging experience at UCSF, allowing direct clinical application of the methodology to study morphologic aberrations associated with ventriculomegaly and to correlate these with clinical outcome. The ability to apply these computational techniques to in-utero data will provide an entirely new view of the developing brain, which promises to shed new light on early developmental problems both in fetuses and premature neonates.           n/a",High Resolution In-Utero Mapping of Fetal Brain Development from Combined MRI,7148587,R01NS055064,"['brain', 'clinical research', 'embryo /fetus']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,R01,2006,274794,0.02594279396767643

"Reconstruction Hardware for Real-Time Moving Tabel MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this project is to design and integrate instrumentation allowing the next generation of real-time image formation in MRI. The motivation comes from an existing project for forming MR images during continuous motion of the patient table. When applied to peripheral MR angiography the target is the formation of a moving table angiogram in which the table motion is precisely matched to the transit of the contrast bolus through the patient. However, implementation of this requires that a number of mathematical processes be done at high speed, including: (i) time-resolved 3D MRI of an extended field of view (FOV); (ii) determination of localized time-dependent parameters such as bolus arrival time and bolus velocity; (iii) variable ordering of phase encodings over the course of an MRI scan, allowing optimized local resolution; (iv) gradient warping correction for MR acquisition done using a moving patient table; (v) multi-coil reconstruction using the SENSE technique, allowing improved lateral resolution for a given acquisition time; (vi) MR acquisition done using a variable table velocity When implemented, these methods will allow the formation of peripheral MR angiograms with optimized, patient-specific table motion, maximum efficiency, and high spatial resolution. Specific aims are: 1. Construction of the Next Generation Real-Time Image MR Reconstruction System. The funding will allow the construction of a system enabling the real-time performance of the mathematical algorithms which perform the above processes. System design will allow the data acquisition and reconstruction to be modified in real time. 2. Incorporation of the New System into the Project of Moving Table MRA.

"Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Microscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will further develop and refine an innovative digital auto-focus technology for automated microscopy. Auto-focusing is essential to automated microscope imaging. Currently available techniques rely on various algorithms of focus computation at a single image resolution and suffer from inherent performance limitations, which affect their success and utilization in clinical and research applications. Auto-focusing for fluorescence microscopy, for example, represents a serious challenge to existing methods for desired accuracy, reliability and speed since in this case the images have very low signal-to-noise ratio and narrow depth-of-fields while specimen exposure to fluorescent excitation must be minimized to avoid photo-bleaching and formation of undesirable substances such as free radicals and singlet oxygen. We propose a novel multi-resolution image analysis approach to microscope auto-focusing, based on the recently developed mathematical theory of wavelet transform. The new approach overcomes a number of inherent limitations of currently available techniques, and holds the promise to make the measurement of the microscope focus function and the detection of best-focus imaging position considerably more accurate, reliable, and fast. This innovative technology will significantly increase the ability and efficacy of automated microscope instruments for a wide range of clinical and research applications where a large number of specimens need to be imaged and quantitatively analyzed on a routine basis. During the Phase 1 project we investigated the feasibility of the proposed technology for fluorescence microscopy. We developed software to implement the algorithms for multi-resolution focus function measurements and for in-focus imaging position search. We evaluated the new approach in software simulation on a variety of sample image stacks of cytogenetic FISH specimens, and compared it with all current best-performing methods for microscope auto-focusing using the criteria of (1) accuracy, (2) range, (3) robustness, and (4) speed. The Phase 1 results suggest that, by using a proper wavelet-based auto-focus function, the new multi-resolution method significantly outperforms all competing methods in each of the aforementioned performance categories, and clearly exceeds the Phase 1 feasibility criteria. In the Phase 2 project, we will further develop, refine, integrate, and validate the new technology in real-time operation environment. We plan to build a prototype system with multi-resolution auto-focusing capabilities for both fluorescence and bright-field microscope imaging. We will evaluate the system extensively for a variety of applications including genetics, pathology, and cytology. We will beta test the new system and technology in routine clinical laboratory environment and optimize the technology as end user input and feedbacks are gathered. Once fully developed and qualified, this new technology will be patented and incorporated into future IRIS automated imaging cytometry instruments. It will also be made commercially available to Applied Imaging Corporation and other manufacturers of automated microscope instruments through licensing agreements and partnerships.           n/a",Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Microscopy,6951446,R44RR016817,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'flow cytometry', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'fluorescent in situ hybridization', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'mathematical model']",NCRR,"ADVANCED DIGITAL IMAGING RESEARCH, LLC",R44,2005,318350,0.011904017287691512

Specifically, the ability to conduct clinical imaging studies across multiple sites, to analyze imaging data with the most powerful software regardless of development site, and to test new hypotheses on large collections of subjects with well characterized image and clinical data would have a demonstrable and positive impact on progress in this field. The Morphometry BIRN (mBIRN), established in October 2001, has made substantial progress in the development of this national infrastructure to develop a data and computational network based on a federated data acquisition and database across seven sites in the service of facilitating multi-site neuroanatomic analysis. Standardized structural MRI image acquisition protocols have been developed and implemented that demonstrably reduce initial sources of inter-site variance. Data structure, transmission, storage and querying aspects of the federated database have been implemented. In this continuation of the mBIRN efforts, we propose three broad areas of work:   1) continuing structural MRI acquisition optimization, calibration and validation to include T2 and DTI; 2) translation of site specific state-of-the-art image analysis, visualization and machine learning technologies to work in the federated, multi-site BIRN environment; and 3) extension of data management and database query capabilities to include additional imaging modalities, clinical disorders and individualized human genetic covariates. These broad areas of work will come together in through key collaborations that will ensure utilization promotion by facilitating data entry into the federated database and creation of database incentive functionality. Our participating sites include MGH (PI), BWH, UCI, Duke, UCLA, UCSD, John Hopkins, and newly added Washington University and MIT. We have made a concerted effort to bridge the gap that can exist between biomedical and computational sciences by recruiting to our group leaders in both of these domains. Our efforts will be coordinated with those of the entire BIRN consortium in order to insure that acquisition and database functionality, and application-based disorder queries are interoperable across sites and designed to advance the capabilities to further knowledge and understanding of health and disease.         n/a",Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network,6952714,U24RR021382,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'computational biology', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'cooperative study', 'data management', 'human subject', 'imaging /visualization /scanning', 'information systems', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'method development', 'molecular biology information system', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychology']",NCRR,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U24,2005,5013536,0.03217947972251925
"COMPUTING TUMOR DETECTION PERFORMANCE IN MEDICAL IMAGING The overall goal is to optimize the design of medical imaging systems and reconstruction algorithms for the purposes of tumor detection in humans and animals.  For imaging systems this is done by devising efficient methods to calculate the performance of ideal observers that use the noisy data from the system on realistic tumor detections tasks.  These methods make use of symmetries of the imaging system, consistency conditions on the data, and constraints on the objects to simplify the computations.  Noise models are chosen to reflect the measurement noise in the system, the background variation in the patient population, and the normal variation in tumor characteristics. Performance of ideal observers is determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.  For a given detection task, this performance is a function of the parameters in the system design.  By varying these parameters the optimal design for tumor detection is found by maximizing this figure of merit.  When the ideal observer performance is too difficult to compute, the ideal linear observer is substituted.  For reconstruction algorithms, the performance of linear mathematical observers using the reconstructed images for tumor detection tasks is computed.  These model observers are chosen to match the performance of human observers on similar tasks.  To compute the performance of these observers, the first-order and second-order statistics of the reconstructed images are calculated or approximated.  These statistical moments are then used to compute the signal-to-noise ratio for the model observer on the given tumor detection task.

"Sono-Contrast Induced Functional Imaging/Spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    An innovative method of in vivo imaging for detection and pathophysiological classification of relatively superficial malignancies is proposed. The technique, sono-contrast induced functional imaging and spectroscopy (SCIFIS), builds upon existing diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) in the near infrared region but uses standing wave focused ultrasound deposition as a contrast agent to improve the sensitivity and specificity of DRS. The overall goal is to develop a non-invasive, real-time modality for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and post-treatment surveillance.   The basis of the proposed in vivo imaging method is that acoustic radiation force delivered by focused ultrasound forming a standing wave causes reversible compression of the vasculature and/or blood flow stasis, and thus temporal changes in hemoglobin concentration, which are registered in the dynamic (pre- and post-insonification) observation of near-infrared spectra. By intersecting the optical path and the acoustic path at an angle and subtracting measured spectra pre- and post-deposition of sono-contrast, signatures of vascular pathophysiology can be identified at the intersecting location.   In the R21 phase, C3H mice inoculated with murine mammary tumors on the left legs will undergo in vivo SCIFIS measurement prior to immunohistochemical examination. Principal component analysis neural networks (PCANN) will be used in data analysis/correlation, leading to definitively tests of the underlying hypotheses via receiver operating characteristics analysis and statistical correlation of tumor detection and vascular distribution predictions.   In the R33 phase, clinical evaluation of the SCIFIS technique will commence following system optimization by Monte Carlo simulation. Non-invasive, in vivo acquisition of SCIFIS spectra will be collected in patients undergoing biopsy for suspicion of breast cancers. The predictive model based on PCANN will be quantitatively compared with pathological tissue diagnoses. In addition, response to radiation treatment and outcome will be correlated with angiogenesis and/or tumor hypoxia findings in the sonocontrast spectra for those patients who are found to have malignant diagnoses and eventually receive radiotherapy. n/a",Sono-Contrast Induced Functional Imaging/Spectroscopy,6783889,R21CA107860,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'hemoglobin', 'human subject', 'immunocytochemistry', 'infrared spectrometry', 'neoplasm /cancer blood supply', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'optics', 'prognosis', 'reflection spectrometry', 'statistics /biometry', 'ultrasound']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2004,168212,0.018355977495246492
"Reconstruction Hardware for Real-Time Moving Table MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this project is to design and integrate instrumentation allowing the next generation of real-time image formation in MRI. The motivation comes from an existing project for forming MR images during continuous motion of the patient table. When applied to peripheral MR angiography the target is the formation of a moving table angiogram in which the table motion is precisely matched to the transit of the contrast bolus through the patient. However, implementation of this requires that a number of mathematical processes be done at high speed, including: (i) time-resolved 3D MRI of an extended field of view (FOV); (ii) determination of localized time-dependent parameters such as bolus arrival time and bolus velocity; (iii) variable ordering of phase encodings over the course of an MRI scan, allowing optimized local resolution; (iv) gradient warping correction for MR acquisition done using a moving patient table; (v) multi-coil reconstruction using the SENSE technique, allowing improved lateral resolution for a given acquisition time; (vi) MR acquisition done using a variable table velocity When implemented, these methods will allow the formation of peripheral MR angiograms with optimized, patient-specific table motion, maximum efficiency, and high spatial resolution. Specific aims are: 1. Construction of the Next Generation Real-Time Image MR Reconstruction System. The funding will allow the construction of a system enabling the real-time performance of the mathematical algorithms which perform the above processes. System design will allow the data acquisition and reconstruction to be modified in real time. 2. Incorporation of the New System into the Project of Moving Table MRA. Once the hardware is integrated into a useable system it will be interfaced to a clinical MRI scanner at Mayo and used in the formation of peripheral contrast-enhanced MR angiograms using continuous motion of the patient table through the scanner gantry.         n/a",Reconstruction Hardware for Real-Time Moving Table MRI,6783945,R33EB004281,"['angiography', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'mathematics', 'physics', 'technology /technique development', 'time resolved data']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC,R33,2004,361371,0.020636743026128734
"Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Microscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will further develop and refine an innovative digital auto-focus technology for automated microscopy. Auto-focusing is essential to automated microscope imaging. Currently available techniques rely on various algorithms of focus computation at a single image resolution and suffer from inherent performance limitations, which affect their success and utilization in clinical and research applications. Auto-focusing for fluorescence microscopy, for example, represents a serious challenge to existing methods for desired accuracy, reliability and speed since in this case the images have very low signal-to-noise ratio and narrow depth-of-fields while specimen exposure to fluorescent excitation must be minimized to avoid photo-bleaching and formation of undesirable substances such as free radicals and singlet oxygen. We propose a novel multi-resolution image analysis approach to microscope auto-focusing, based on the recently developed mathematical theory of wavelet transform. The new approach overcomes a number of inherent limitations of currently available techniques, and holds the promise to make the measurement of the microscope focus function and the detection of best-focus imaging position considerably more accurate, reliable, and fast. This innovative technology will significantly increase the ability and efficacy of automated microscope instruments for a wide range of clinical and research applications where a large number of specimens need to be imaged and quantitatively analyzed on a routine basis. During the Phase 1 project we investigated the feasibility of the proposed technology for fluorescence microscopy. We developed software to implement the algorithms for multi-resolution focus function measurements and for in-focus imaging position search. We evaluated the new approach in software simulation on a variety of sample image stacks of cytogenetic FISH specimens, and compared it with all current best-performing methods for microscope auto-focusing using the criteria of (1) accuracy, (2) range, (3) robustness, and (4) speed. The Phase 1 results suggest that, by using a proper wavelet-based auto-focus function, the new multi-resolution method significantly outperforms all competing methods in each of the aforementioned performance categories, and clearly exceeds the Phase 1 feasibility criteria. In the Phase 2 project, we will further develop, refine, integrate, and validate the new technology in real-time operation environment. We plan to build a prototype system with multi-resolution auto-focusing capabilities for both fluorescence and bright-field microscope imaging. We will evaluate the system extensively for a variety of applications including genetics, pathology, and cytology. We will beta test the new system and technology in routine clinical laboratory environment and optimize the technology as end user input and feedbacks are gathered. Once fully developed and qualified, this new technology will be patented and incorporated into future IRIS automated imaging cytometry instruments. It will also be made commercially available to Applied Imaging Corporation and other manufacturers of automated microscope instruments through licensing agreements and partnerships.           n/a",Multiresolution Autofocusing for Automated Microscopy,6833120,R44RR016817,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical automation', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'flow cytometry', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'fluorescent in situ hybridization', 'human data', 'image enhancement', 'image processing', 'mathematical model']",NCRR,"ADVANCED DIGITAL IMAGING RESEARCH, LLC",R44,2004,427818,0.011904017287691512
"A Context-Sensitive Teleconsultation Infrastructure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consultation with appropriate specialists improves the quality of healthcare, particularly in patients with complicated cases or chronic illnesses. And for the majority of such patients, specialists use imaging studies (e.g., MR, CT) to objectively document the disease process (e.g., a cancer patient on chemotherapy). However, specialists are generally not available in all communities, tending to be concentrated in academic/specialty centers. Thus, to facilitate the routine use of teleconsultations for patients when specialists are not locally present: 1) the images captured to document the patient's condition must be incorporated into the medical record to enable proper review; and 2) the remote consultant should only receive pertinent parts of the medical record to streamline the consultation process. This proposal is focused on developing and testing a ""context-sensitive"" telehealth infrastructure based on: 1) automated incorporation of clinical context (patient presentation and referring physician hypothesis) to focus the consultation process; 2) a knowledge-base derived from data mining of natural language processing (NLP) results, mapping patient presentation to select an appropriate imaging study based on anatomical region and imaging parameters; and 3) automated selection of key anatomical structures in the acquired imaging study through the use of a contrast-customizable atlas and rigid body/deformable registration algorithms. Collectively, these technologies will allow context-sensitive, automated summarization of medical records for telehealth in a real-world environment. The proposed technologies will be implemented for neurological and musculoskeletal domains, two areas that are MR imaging intensive.      Technical evaluation will be performed with experts serving as the reference standard and will focus on measuring: 1) the accuracy of the corpus based, NLP-guided knowledge-base in selecting relevant anatomical structures; and 2) the accuracy of anatomical structure delineation using the customizable atlas registration methods.

"Novel Methods for Automated Key Image Selection    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Significant new knowledge about human behavior and the brain has come to light in recent years, due in part to rapid technical developments in imaging. As the role of imaging becomes increasingly important in neurosciences, effective methods for managing and retrieving images will become even more critical; without such advances, further progress will be hindered. The goal of this proposal is the automated summarization of large imaging sets. Image summarization proffers a method to compress imaging studies by selecting only pertinent image slices that objectively document a patient's condition; as such, its applications include multimedia electronic medical records, telemedicine, and teaching files. In Phase I, development is focused on a customizable brain atlas used for registering patient imaging studies in order to select key images. This phase addresses selection of images from ""normal"" studies and studies with only subtle morphological changes, as typical of most patients with psychiatric disorders. Automatic techniques for customizing the atlas to imaging study acquisition parameters are developed, in addition to registration methods for mapping the atlas to the patient's original study. Building from this initial work, Phase II expands to encompass selection of images from ""abnormal"" studies that exhibit gross morphological changes through principle component analysis, further customization of the atlas for different age groups (e.g., pediatric), and incorporation of structured data entry (SDE) and natural language processing (NLP) of medical reports to help guide automatic selection of key images. The resultant product will be a fully automated software system that can select relevant images from any imaging study. Initial evaluation in Phase I will examine the performance of the contrast customizable atlas and summarization/relevant slice selection, as compared to human experts.         n/a",Novel Methods for Automated Key Image Selection,6583176,R43MH065764,"['archives', ' biomedical automation', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' human data', ' image processing', ' method development']",NIMH,MEDAXIS CORPORATION,R43,2003,93365,0.020939979144080863

"Reliable and Robust ECG Gating Signal for MR Imaging The focus of this project is to develop and evaluate a noel and reliable system for ECG triggering during cardiac MR imaging. Understanding the mechanism of heart failure and cardiomyopathy using MRI requires reliable and robust ECG gating (or triggering). To provide effective ECG gating, the first specific aim of this Phase I project is to design and develop an ECG lead system and concomitant signal processing methodology to allow for improved ECG detection with the magnetic. Our preliminary data describing our optimal vector signal set approach , coupled with a dual derivative ECG detections scheme, appear to be effective in reliably detecting the ECG during MR imaging. An improved ECG trigger will provide cardiac MRI imaging without the artifacts of cardiac and respiratory motion. Our second specific aim is to design and develop a wireless (telemetry) infrared (IR) system for ECG trigger transmission to eliminate the need for either wiring or a fiber optic cable during MRI examinations. Additionally preliminary data demonstrates the capability of our IR telemetry system to transmit the ECG in laboratory tests. Our optimal telemetry system will also mitigate against many of the artifacts involved in the development of an effective MRI ECG trigger. During Phase I we will demonstrate the feasibility of our system by evaluating system performance in 20 human subjects undergoing cardiac MR imaging. We believe our approach should provide a reliable and robust ECG gated trigger with minimal delay from the onset of the R-wave. Such a trigger would minimize blurring artifacts from cardiac and respiratory motion and improve MR tagging studies. Should our phase I project be successful, we would develop a real-time implementation of the entire system in an expanded Phase II biomedical engineering and extended clinical study. A successful Phase I and II project would likely receive commercial backing from a major MRI instrument manufacturer.

"ENERGY RESOLVED DIGITAL HPGE X OR Y-RAY IMAGING DETECTOR Imaging detectors for 10 to 150 keV photons have many uses in medical technology, including tumor imaging, SPECT, and radiography. Digital output is particularly useful since it allows image enhancement, analysis, transmission and storage. In Phase I we proposed a new technology that could capture images with 100 microm spatial resolution and 1 keV energy resolution or better. This capability would facilitate entirely new classes of medical diagnostic procedures, particularly for transgenic small animal imaging. Our Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In this Phase II effort, collaborating with Paul Luke at LBNL, we will construct 1 cm thick crossed-strip HPGe detectors having 10 x 10 strips, each 2 mm x 20 mm. We will develop cooled FET preamplifiers having low noise and large bandwidth properties specifically required by this approach. We will also develop analog filtering electronics to condition the detector's novel signals and employ digital pulse processing electronics to acquire these signals at rates up to 10/6 cps. Finally, we will devise procedures to test the detector's linearity and develop processing algorithms to perfect this quality. Phase II will conclude with a working and tested prototype. Phase III will entail primarily production engineering efforts.

When the ideal observer performance is too difficult to compute, the ideal linear observer is substituted.  For reconstruction algorithms, the performance of linear mathematical observers using the reconstructed images for tumor detection tasks is computed.  These model observers are chosen to match the performance of human observers on similar tasks.  To compute the performance of these observers, the first-order and second-order statistics of the reconstructed images are calculated or approximated.  These statistical moments are then used to compute the signal-to-noise ratio for the model observer on the given tumor detection task.  Of particular interest is the role of redundant data and null functions of the imaging system in the deterministic and statistical properties of the reconstruction algorithms.  n/a",COMPUTING TUMOR DETECTION PERFORMANCE IN MEDICAL IMAGING,6377983,K01CA087017,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' performance', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K01,2001,120093,0.02316973564617898
"Shearography for Non-Invasive Dental Health Evaluation   DESCRIPTION: Optical holography has been applied to non-invasive clinical            diagnosis and monitoring of Dental and oral/facial pathology, but has been           sharply limited in its usefulness by its requirements of high laser coherence.       absolute stability of setup. and wet processing of holograms. Physical Optics        Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a shearographic micro-optic camera as a        novel means of non-invasive Dental evaluation and characterization based on          shearing speckle interferometry, miniature camera imaging, and proprietary           neural network image processing. The innovation in this concept is the use of        shearography to avoid the need for high stability, high temporal coherence, and      wet processing. Nearfield shearography will have high spatial resolution, and        the neural network will perform real-time data processing and display.                                                                                                    The unique high resolution. real-time operation. low cost. and miniaturization       will make this device attractive to a large commercial market in Dental and          clinical applications.                                                                                                                                                    In Phase 1. POC will develop a miniature shearographic micro-optic camera            (SMOC) with fiber light delivery. a micro-CCD imaging component. and neural          network. It will be capable of distinguishing among tooth enamel, cementum,           dentine, pulp, and soft tissue.                                                      PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  This compact, low-cost, high resolution non-invasive shearography device will represent a  technological breakthrough not only for oral diagnostics but also for biomedical imaging in  general.  Because of its high resolution, real-time operation, and immunity to vibration, it will  also have wide applications beyond the medical field, particularly for industrial diagnostics.  High-strength aerospace composite material evaluation and testing as well as weld and pipe  defect inspection are areas where it will be particularly welcome.                                                                                     n/a",Shearography for Non-Invasive Dental Health Evaluation,6404393,R43DE014307,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' dental disorder diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' fiber optics', ' image processing', ' interferometry', ' lasers', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' oral health', ' video recording system']",NIDCR,PHYSICAL OPTICS CORPORATION,R43,2001,100000,0.005188059656629342
"3D Cerebral vessel location for surgical planning   DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from Applicant's Abstract): This proposal is a competing       renewal of a grant on 3D intracerebral vascular imaging. We intend to build          upon our earlier work by providing a clinically useful, symbolic description of      blood vessels supplying vascular CNS tumors, including both solid tumors and         arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). For both the surgeon and the                     interventionalist, it would be enormously valuable to provide a 3D map that          contains the tumor margins, that illustrates 3D parent-child vascular                connectivity information, that shows the relationship between arteries and           veins in AVMs, and that readily segregates vascular branches supplying a tumor       from branches supplying normal brain. These kinds of information are those that      the clinican most needs to know. Such information is not directly available to       clinicians by any current imaging methodology.                                                                                                                            The specific aims of this proposal include: 1) segmentation of solid tumors          from MR, 2) segmentation of AVMs from magnetic resonance angiograms (MRA) and        MR, 3) registration of MR with MRA data, 4) development of methods of vascular       desbription to separate arteries from veins and to delineate which arterial          branches (and descendents) supply only tumor and which supply brain, and 5)          tests of the accuracy and utility of our methodology.                                                                                                                     In addition to its clinical goals, this proposal aims to meet a number of            challenges in computer vision research, including tumor segmentation using a         range of cues, a statistical atlas based definition of named vessels, and            automated definition of vessel branchpoints. The methods we propose are              unavailable elsewhere and should be profoundly useful to clinicians. We propose      a number of studies to evaluate the accuracy and utility of our approach, and        we also propose new visualization methods to indicate the uncertainty of our         symbolic descriptions of image objects. n/a",3D Cerebral vessel location for surgical planning,6324990,R01CA067812,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' blood vessel disorder', ' brain neoplasms', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', ' cardiovascular surgery', ' cerebrovascular imaging /visualization', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human subject', ' image processing', ' magnetic resonance imaging', ' neoplasm /cancer blood supply', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer surgery', ' neurosurgery']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2001,355229,0.028294517160238723
"METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF TAGGED MR CARDIAC IMAGES DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract):  The aim of this proposal       is to further develop and validate algorithms for analysis of SPAMM MR           cardiac images based on novel spline methods.  MRI is unique in its ability      to non-invasively and selectively alter tissue magnetization, and create         tagged patterns within the deforming tissue such as the heart muscle.  The       resulting pattern defines a time-varying curvilinear coordinate system on        the underlying tissue, allowing for precise and quantitative measurement of      tissue motion and deformation.  The investigators are developing two             frameworks for analysis of SPAMM tagged images, both of these aimed at           providing a more automated and reproducible approach to analysis of SPAMM        data, as well as providing dense 3-D displacement information at all points      within the LV myocardium.  The investigators propose to (a) further develop      and extend our analyses techniques.  The extensions considered will all be       related and based on currently developed computer vision-based techniques        for regional LV wall motion analysis, that operates either on a sequence of      SA slice stacks or on a time sequence of single slice.  (b) The                  investigators will validate the motion tracking methods by comparing ""true""      and algorithm-estimated motion trajectories:  1) on dense field of points        derived from 3-D tagged computer models of objects that simulate the moving      LV, 2) on dense field of points derived from Finite Element Model                simulations of the constitutive equations of LV deformations (once again tag     planes will be superimposed on the time course of simulated geometries), 3)      on selected points in the LV myocardium of the in vivo heart using a porcine     model.  Here, ""true"" motion will be determined by tracking implanted image       distinguishable markers.  (c) The investigators will test whether regions of     postmortem myocardial injury imply similar-sized and locate regions of           altered deformations (as measured by parameters developed in (a)).  The          algorithm-derived LV function assessment based on the analysis of in vivo        tagged MRI sequences will be compared with postmortem myocardial injury          assessment determined by myocardial staining techniques.  The validated          parameters will also be use to examine the time-course of change in the          ischemic areas of the chronic animal models.                                      n/a",METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF TAGGED MR CARDIAC IMAGES,6389619,R01HL057628,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cardiography', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer simulation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' heart motion', ' histopathology', ' human subject', ' image processing', ' magnetic resonance imaging', ' myocardial ischemia /hypoxia', ' swine']",NHLBI,BARNES-JEWISH HOSPITAL,R01,2001,122402,-0.00776315545488178
"ENERGY RESOLVED DIGITAL HPGE X OR Y-RAY IMAGING DETECTOR Imaging detectors for 10 to 150 keV photons have many uses in medical technology, including tumor imaging, SPECT, and radiography. Digital output is particularly useful since it allows image enhancement, analysis, transmission and storage. In Phase I we proposed a new technology that could capture images with 100 microm spatial resolution and 1 keV energy resolution or better. This capability would facilitate entirely new classes of medical diagnostic procedures, particularly for transgenic small animal imaging. Our Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In this Phase II effort, collaborating with Paul Luke at LBNL, we will construct 1 cm thick crossed-strip HPGe detectors having 10 x 10 strips, each 2 mm x 20 mm. We will develop cooled FET preamplifiers having low noise and large bandwidth properties specifically required by this approach. We will also develop analog filtering electronics to condition the detector's novel signals and employ digital pulse processing electronics to acquire these signals at rates up to 10/6 cps. Finally, we will devise procedures to test the detector's linearity and develop processing algorithms to perfect this quality. Phase II will conclude with a working and tested prototype. Phase III will entail primarily production engineering efforts. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: As an energy resolved digital detector with 100 microm spatial resolution, the proposed detector technology could find many medical applications, including SPECT, energy resolved angiography for small mammals, bone densitometry on rodent bones, and small, hand-held gamma cameras. Non-medical applications would include non-destructive testing, astrophysical gamma imaging, nuclear cleanup uses, and x-ray diffraction detectors.  n/a",ENERGY RESOLVED DIGITAL HPGE X OR Y-RAY IMAGING DETECTOR,6211037,R44CA075844,"['X ray', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' cadmium', ' clinical biomedical equipment', ' digital imaging', ' gamma radiation', ' tellurium', ' zinc']",NCI,X-RAY INSTRUMENTATION ASSOCIATES,R44,2000,416478,0.015389034933324823
"COMPUTING TUMOR DETECTION PERFORMANCE IN MEDICAL IMAGING The overall goal is to optimize the design of medical imaging systems and reconstruction algorithms for the purposes of tumor detection in humans and animals.  For imaging systems this is done by devising efficient methods to calculate the performance of ideal observers that use the noisy data from the system on realistic tumor detections tasks.  These methods make use of symmetries of the imaging system, consistency conditions on the data, and constraints on the objects to simplify the computations.  Noise models are chosen to reflect the measurement noise in the system, the background variation in the patient population, and the normal variation in tumor characteristics. Performance of ideal observers is determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.  For a given detection task, this performance is a function of the parameters in the system design.  By varying these parameters the optimal design for tumor detection is found by maximizing this figure of merit.  When the ideal observer performance is too difficult to compute, the ideal linear observer is substituted.  For reconstruction algorithms, the performance of linear mathematical observers using the reconstructed images for tumor detection tasks is computed.

"DEVELOPMENT OF A KNOWLEDGE-BASED IMAGE REPORTING SYSTEM We have constructed a prototype structured reporting system that replaces conventional dictation and transcription for medical image reporting. Key design features include reporting speed, generation of graphical reports, structured storage of imaging findings, and the use of existing lexicons. Pilot timing data suggest that a radiologist using our system can generate a report more rapidly than with conventional reporting methods or speech recognition systems. Support is sought to refine the prototype, and to conduct feasibility testing. The specific aims are (1) to augment and refine a hierarchical test lexicon of imaging terms (2) to develop methods for the representation and reporting of imaging findings and their logical relationships, (3) to evaluate the system's performance on clinical imaging reports, and (4) to assess the completeness of existing lexicons for imaging. The project is supported by a Technical Advisory Committee comprised of experts in key methodological areas. A successful Phase I will lead (in Phase II) to testing of the approach for cross-sectional imaging, to adoption, augmentation, and use of an existing lexicon, to construction of real-time decision support techniques based on the knowledge base of imaging findings generated by the system, and to system evaluation in a clinical setting. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Our structured reporting system is appealing to radiologists because it speeds up the reporting process compared to conventional dictation/transcription or speech recognition. In addition, the system eliminates the costs, delays, inaccuracies, and other organizational problems associated with transcription services, thereby improving patient care. Therefore, time-efficient, speech-augmented structured reporting systems will likely capture a significant segment of the $1.2 billion annual market for radiology transcription services.  n/a",DEVELOPMENT OF A KNOWLEDGE-BASED IMAGE REPORTING SYSTEM,6073984,R43LM006837,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' information systems', ' vocabulary', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,"EDICT SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2000,98563,-0.05248532348930882

"Deep learning for renal tumor characterization Our long-term objective is to develop deep learning techniques capable of predicting characteristics and treatment response or response to surveillance to assist clinical decision- making in renal tumors that are potential candidates for ablation therapy, biopsy, active surveillance or surgical resection. An increasing number of renal tumors are being diagnosed, due in part to incidental detection from the increased use of cross-sectional imaging. Although partial nephrectomy is still considered the primary treatment for small renal masses, percutaneous ablation is increasingly performed as a therapeutic, nephron-sparing approach. One challenge for interventional radiologists and urologists who manage these patients is selection for therapy, since the average rate of progression is slow for small renal tumors and metastasis rarely occurs. A technique that could distinguish indolent tumors from those will progress based on data from the imaging methods used to detect and delineate renal masses would enable early triage to observation versus invasive treatment. Deep learning, a type of machine learning technique which takes raw images as input, and applies many layers of transformations to calculate an output signal, has already led to breakthroughs in other areas of image recognition, and is increasingly used for medical image analysis. However, its application in the field of interventional radiology is currently limited. Furthermore, no study in the literature has applied deep learning to kidney lesion segmentation and characteristics/outcome prediction. In this project, we propose to develop novel deep learning architectures based on routine MR imaging that allow for accurate renal mass segmentation and prediction of characteristics and outcome in renal tumors. Using data from four independent cohorts, we will use our deep learning architectures to predict (1) benign versus malignant histology (2) growth rate in stage 1a renal cell carcinoma (3) SSIGN score in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and (4) clinical endpoints. We will integrate segmentation and classification into one net that suitable for clinical application. In addition, we will compare results with those of experts and traditional machine learning approaches. The inability to determine aggressiveness of renal tumors based on pretreatment imaging makes it challenging for urologists or interventional radiologists to select appropriate patients for active surveillance versus therapy with nephrectomy or ablation. Our research project uses deep learning to distinguish renal mass from normal tissue and predict characteristics, treatment response or response to surveillance in renal tumors. By using a multi-institutional patient cohort and conventional MR imaging sequences, we will demonstrate the generalizability and broad applicability of our algorithm. Our models have the potential to help guide clinical management of patients with renal tumors.",Deep learning for renal tumor characterization,9968604,R03CA249554,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clear cell renal cell carcinoma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dropout', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Indolent', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Kidney', 'Modeling', 'Nephrectomy', 'Nephrons', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal Mass', 'Research Project Grants', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Urologist', 'Weight', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'random forest', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R03,2020,80500,0.02591726268041211
"Can machines be trusted? Robustification of deep learning for medical imaging Machine learning algorithms have become increasing popular in medical imaging, where highly functional algorithms have been trained to recognize patterns or features within image data sets and perform clinically relevant tasks such as tumor segmentation and disease diagnosis. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, by leveraging massive datasets and immense computing power to extract features from data. Deep learning is ideally suited for problems in medical imaging, and has enjoyed success in diverse tasks such as segmenting cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues. However, research in machine learning has also shown that deep learning is fragile in the sense that carefully designed perturbations to an image can cause the algorithm to fail. These perturbations can be designed to be imperceptible by humans, so that a trained radiologist would not make the same mistakes. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation, it is therefore crucial to develop a better understanding of the performance of neural networks. Specifically, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data. The goal of this project is to explore these questions in the context of medical imaging—to better identify strengths, weaknesses, and failure points of deep learning algorithms. We posit that malicious perturbations, of the type studied in theoretical machine learning, may not be representative of the sort of noise encountered in medical images. Although noise is inevitable in a physical system, the noise arising from sources such as subject motion, operator error, or instrument malfunction may have less deleterious effects on a deep learning algorithm. We propose to characterize the effect of these perturbations on the performance of deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we will study the effect of random labeling error introduced into the data set, as might arise due to honest human error. We will also develop new methods for making deep learning algorithms more robust to the types of clinically relevant perturbations described above. In summary, although the susceptibility of neural networks to small errors in the inputs is widely recognized in the deep learning community, our work will investigate these general phenomena in the specific case of medical imaging tasks, and also conduct the first study of average-case errors that could realistically arise in clinical studies. Furthermore, we will produce novel recommendations for how to quantify and improve the resiliency of deep learning approaches in medical imaging. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning by achieving superhuman performance on many tasks. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation in assisting radiologists for tasks such as segmentation of cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data.

"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke.

"Cerebrovascular Reserve Imaging with Simultaneous PET/MRI Using Arterial Spin Labeling and Deep Learning Cerebrovascular disease remains a common cause of death and major disability in the United States, and identifying and preventing strokes should be a high priority. Direct measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is challeng- ing in these patients, since we do not have a non-invasive, radiation-free imaging method that has been appropriately validated against gold standard techniques. This is important, because there is compelling evidence that measuring the CBF change before and after a stress test meant to increase CBF (a measurement known as cerebrovascular reserve [CVR]) can identify patients at increased stroke risk. Stress tests have been a mainstay of the diagnostic workup of cardiology patients for many years, and we believe strongly that their use will benefit cerebrovascular disease patients as well. The goal of this project is to improve the quality of arterial spin label (ASL) MRI using deep learning, a powerful form of machine learning, that is currently undergoing tremendous progress. We will then to apply this in a prospective, adaptive validation trial against oxygen-15 water PET CBF, using simultaneous PET/MRI to minimize biological variability. Finally, we will apply this improv- ed tool to study the effects of gender on CVR and its reproducibility. Successful completion of this study will result in a validated methodology to assess CVR in cerebrovascular disease patients without the use of radiation or contrast. As such, it will provide solid, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians developing new paradigms and interventions in patients with impaired CVR. There is strong evidence that imaging of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), the ability to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to a challenge, can identify patients at increased risk of stroke. Therefore, measuring CVR would be extremely useful for designing clinical trials of interventions to mitigate this risk. However, current methods to measure CBF and CVR are suboptimal, and do not work well in patients with cerebrovascular disease.

"Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning Project Summary Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in approximately a third of all MRI scans. The unique relaxation parameters of GBCAs create indispensable image contrast for a wide range of clinical applications, such as angiography and tumor detection. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF can be painful, cause severe disability, and even death. The risk of developing NSF prevents millions of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams. The recent identification of gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised additional safety concerns about the usage of GBCAs. Studies have demonstrated increased signal intensity on the unenhanced T1-weighted MR images that is correlated with previous GBCA exposure, and this gadolinium retention is independent of renal function. While initial reports focused on linear GBCAs, more recent reports show that gadolinium deposition occurs with macrocyclic GBCAs as well, albeit at lower levels. FDA has recently issued warnings about gadolinium retention following contrast-enhanced MRI, and required GBCA manufacturers to conduct human and animal studies to further assess the safety of these contrast agents. This project addresses these concerns by developing low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL). Approach: This fast-track project has two phases and three aims. Aim 1 (Phase I) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using pre-contrast images and contrast-enhanced images acquired with only 10% of standard GBCA dose. A software infrastructure will be constructed to seamlessly integrate the DL software between MR scanners and PACS. Aim 2 (Phase II) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using GBCA-free acquisitions with different image contrast. In Aim 3 (Phase II), we will clinically validate and evaluate both low-dose and zero-dose DL methods, including on patients with mild- to-moderate CKD. Non-inferiority tests and diagnostic performance of the synthesized full-dose images compared to the true full-dose images will be performed. Significance: This work will lead to safer contrast-enhanced MRI. The low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI method will benefit not only millions of patients with advanced CKD, who cannot currently undergo contrast-enhanced MRI, but many more patients with normal kidney function, who are at the risk of gadolinium retention after contrast-enhanced MRI. Project Narrative Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in MRI exams to create indispensable image contrast for monitoring treatment and investigating pathology and function. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, preventing patients with advanced chronic kidney disease from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams, as well as potential gadolinium deposition in the body and brain for patients with normal kidney function.

"Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction Project Summary We propose a novel way of reconstructing medical images rooted in deep learning and computer vision that models the process how human radiologists are using years of experience from reading thousands of cases to recognize anatomical structures, pathologies and image artifacts. Our approach is based on the novel idea of a variational network, which embeds a generalized compressed sensing concept within a deep learning framework. We propose to learn a complete reconstruction procedure, including filter kernels and penalty functions to separate between true image content and artifacts, all parameters that normally have to be tuned manually as well as the associated numerical algorithm described by this variational network. The training step is decoupled from the time critical image reconstruction step, which can then be performed in near-real-time without interruption of clinical workflow. Our preliminary patient data from accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions suggest that our learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of currently existing image reconstruction methods and is robust with respect to the variations that arise in a daily clinical imaging situation. In our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition. In the second aim, we will answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications. Finally, we will perform a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee. We will compare our proposed approach to a clinical standard reconstruction. Our hypothesis is that our approach will lead to the same clinical diagnosis and patient management decisions when using a 5min exam. The immediate benefit of the project is to bring accelerated imaging to an application with wide public-health impact, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing health-care costs. Additionally, the insights gained from the developments in this project will answer the currently most important open questions in the emerging field of machine learning for medical image reconstruction. Finally, given the recent increase of activities in this field, there is a significant demand for a publicly available data repository for raw k-space data that can be used for training and validation. Since all data that will be acquired in this project will be made available to the research community, this project will be a first step to meet this demand. Project Narrative The overarching goal of the proposal is to develop a novel machine learning-based image reconstruction approach and validate it for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The approach is able to learn the characteristic appearance of clinical imaging datasets, as well as suppression of artifacts that arise during data acquisition. We will test the hypotheses that learning can be performed such that it is robust against changes in data acquisition, answer the question if it is possible to learn a single reconstruction procedure for multiple MR imaging applications, and validate our approach in a clinical reader study for 300 patients undergoing imaging for internal derangement of the knee.",Learning an Optimized Variational Network for Medical Image Reconstruction,9997914,R01EB024532,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Step training', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'patient population', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,498014,0.04404191759902534
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,9853761,R01CA218187,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'PSA level', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,671823,-0.02183236915541039
"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,10193990,R33AR073552,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Models', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'automated segmentation', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R33,2020,403748,0.038387933346502014
"Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy Project Summary/Abstract Diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) currently relies on a qualitative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and lacks standardization. This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9928429,R21EB026665,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Central cord canal structure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intelligence', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiculopathy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'segmentation algorithm', 'software infrastructure', 'theories', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment optimization', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2020,195000,0.008790798854689464
"Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images ABSTRACT The goal of this R03 Small Grant Program for NIDDK is to provide additional funding for Dr. Kline to expand upon his work on his K award and apply his expertise to new image acquisitions and problems related to renal imaging. Dr. Kline’s work has piqued the interest of many internal and external investigators and has led to recent collaborations with Drs. Rule, Denic, and Kim. Together with Dr. Erickson, this new research team has prepared this R03 proposal which takes advantage of the unique expertise of each team member. The focus of this proposal is to bridge the gap between microscopic observations and those assessable non-invasively by radiological imaging. To do this, we have established a unique dataset of renal CT imaging data and corresponding biopsy measured nephron densities. We have also generated a large database of gold-standard segmentation data of kidneys, cortical regions, and medullary pyramids. Using this existing data, we propose to: (i) develop tools for segmentation of kidneys, segmentation of individual medullary pyramids, and imputing missing parts of the kidneys outside of the imaged field-of-view in the CT image, and (ii) to establish imaging biomarkers of early CKD, and correlate macroscopic imaging findings to underlying microscopic structure. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic’s outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Aging Kidney Anatomy Study (PI: Rule), which led to the generation of this unique and well characterized dataset. Dr. Kline’s background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly well suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, near the end of this research project Dr. Kline will submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of renal imaging biomarkers. Obtaining this R03 Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline’s transition into a prosperous independent researcher focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. Narrative Non-invasive methods for characterizing micro-structural changes of the kidney during aging as well as in health and disease are currently not possible. This research program proposes to use our existing database of renal imaging and renal biopsy data to bridge the gap between macroscopic radiological findings on computed tomography images to those assessable in microscopic images of renal biopsies. This program will develop new automated methods for performing measurements on the images, as well as use machine/deep learning methods to search for new imaging biomarkers that relate to nephron density and size, as well as establish their usefulness for early chronic kidney disease detection and transplant planning.",Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images,10040835,R03DK125632,"['Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Albuminuria', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Award', 'Biopsy', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrons', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Stenosis', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Tubular formation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'density', 'early detection biomarkers', 'graft failure', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'learning strategy', 'living kidney donor', 'member', 'microscopic imaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technology', 'personalized decision', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'research clinical testing', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R03,2020,113350,-0.028943623874125978
"Deep-learning based spatial multiple testing for Alzheimer's neuroimaging data Project Summary The broad objective of this research is to develop a powerful deep-learning based multiple testing approach for high-dimensional spatial data that arise commonly in biomedical imaging studies, in particular, brain imaging studies. The motivating problem is to detect the cerebral metabolic abnormalities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data. Existing multiple testing approaches in solving this problem often ignore or inadequately capture the spatial dependence among the test statistics obtained from brain voxels and thus lose substantial power for the detection. We will develop a novel spatial multiple testing method that utilizes the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), a key deep- learning technique, to well capture the spatial dependence among test statistics and thus to achieve the optimal power in the sense of minimizing the false nondiscovery rate (FNR) while correctly controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at a given level. The proposed DCNN-based FDR controlling method has enhanced power to discover new AD-related brain regions that are missed by conventional methods, thereby leading to novel clinical and pathological studies. The specific aims of this proposal include: 1. To develop an optimal spatial FDR controlling approach by connecting the unsupervised local-significance-index based multiple testing with the supervised DCNN-based image segmentation; 2. To evaluate the proposed spatial FDR controlling approach via extensive simulations under various three-dimensional spatial dependence structures, in comparison with multiple classical and state-of-the-art methods; 3. To apply proposed spatial FDR controlling approach to detect AD-related brain regions using the FDG-PET datasets from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the Weill Cornell Brain Health Imaging Institute; 4. To develop a user- friendly and publicly available software package with versions in both Python and R to implement the proposed spatial FDR controlling approach. The proposed DCNN-based approach will also be widely applicable to large- scale multiple testing problems in other fields of biomedical research that involve spatial dependence. Project Narrative This project will exploit recent advances in deep learning to efficiently solve the large-scale spatial multiple testing problems that arise commonly in biomedical imaging studies. The proposed powerful deep-learning based spatial multiple testing approach will be particularly useful in brain imaging studies on neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and age-related cognitive impairment.",Deep-learning based spatial multiple testing for Alzheimer's neuroimaging data,10107565,R21AG070303,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Architecture', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Fluorine', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Group', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain health', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'metabolic rate', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'repository', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,435875,-0.04848449782392891

"Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and aggressive malignant adult brain tumor, with grim prognosis and heterogeneous molecular and imaging profiles. Although the currently applicable treatment options (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) have expanded during the last 20 years, there is no substantial improvement in the OS rates. The major obstacle in treating GBM patients is the heterogeneity of their molecular landscape. Determination of molecular targets requires ex vivo postoperative tissue analyses, which are limited in assessing the tumor's spatial heterogeneity (sampling error due to single sample histopathological and molecular analysis) and temporal heterogeneity (not possible to continuously assess the molecular transformation of the tumor during treatment). Herein we propose to develop quantitative imaging phenomic (QIP) markers of a range of mutations of interest in GB. We will build on prior work on EGFR, IDH1 mutations and MGMT methylation QIP signatures, and develop an extensive panel of imaging signatures of 10 gene mutations, as well as MGMT promoter methylation, using machine learning methods applied to relatively routine clinical mpMRI (standard plus diffusion tensor and perfusion protocols). Availability of such biomarkers can contribute to non-invasive i) patient stratification into appropriate treatments, ii) measurement of individual molecular characteristics. In particular, we propose to carry out the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (SA1): To develop the enabling methodologies for constructing Quantitative Imaging Phenomic signatures of GB mutations Specific Aim 2 (SA2): Establish QIP signatures of 10 mutations of interest in gliomas, plus MGMT promoter status, using next generation sequencing (NGS). We will use 709 datasets. Specific Aim 3 (SA3): Characterize the molecular heterogeneity of GB using QIP signatures, leveraging the NGS samples of SA1, as well as a new sample that we will genotype, adding to a total of 600 tumor samples obtained from 4 different locations per patient from 150 patients. The first 150 tissue samples are already analyzed as part of ongoing work. Specific Aim 4 (SA4): Integrate our methods into the Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk), in order to allow easy access to them by users This project will investigate the relationship between imaging characteristics of glioblastoma and its underlying genetic mutations/variants. As such, it aims to develop a number of imaging signatures of mutations that are important in GBM, using 1,159 (709 patients plus an additional 450 tissue samples of 150 of these patients obtained from different locations in the tumor) analyzed via next generation sequencing. The primary motivation of this work is to develop the imaging analytics methodologies and associated biomarkers that will allow us to evaluate the spatial, temporal and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastoma, thereby assisting in patient stratification and treatment.",Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning,9893291,R01NS042645,"['Adult', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiogenomics', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'genetic signature', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'molecular imaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'phenomics', 'predictive signature', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'receptor', 'routine imaging', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,670422,0.017192567871864132
"Automatic Volumetric Treatment Response Assessment and Determination of Regional Genetic Characteristics in Glioblastoma Project Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary adult brain tumor with an incidence rate of 3.2 per 100,000 people. Due to its heterogeneous genetic characteristics, GBM carries a dismal prognosis, with a median survival of only 14 months and five-year survival rates are less than 10%. The current standard of care is maximal safe surgical resection, chemoradiation, and adjuvant temozolomide. Within the natural history of GBM, there are adaptive genetic changes within the tumor that lead to treatment resistance and inevitable recurrence, leading to patient death. While a variety of treatments can be administered for tumor recurrence, there is currently no consensus on therapy for recurrent tumor as none have been proven to provide substantial survival benefit. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment. Rather, clinical decision-making is based on a manual and variable two- dimensional measure of tumor burden, a surrogate of tumor volume, and genetic characterization of select molecular markers at the time of initial surgery. A tool that can automatically assess tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics longitudinally will substantially improve evaluation of treatment efficacy, allowing for an earlier switch to alternative treatment strategies and thus, more personalized tailoring of patient care. Thus, a critical need exists for automatic methods that non-invasively evaluate treatment efficacy on a patient-to-patient basis. To address this problem, we will develop a novel solution based on deep learning that leverages structural, diffusion, and perfusion information from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging. At the core of our solution is a convolutional neural network; a machine learning technique that can be trained on raw image data to predict clinical outputs of interest. Firstly, we will develop a fully automatic technique for longitudinal tracking of tumor volumes. To do this, we will develop novel deep learning architectures through incorporation of state-of-the-art neural network components that can segment both whole tumor and tumor subregions (edema, non-enhancing tumor, and gadolinium contrast-enhancing tumor). To prove algorithm utility, we will automatically derive tumor volumes in a longitudinal patient cohort and correlate volumes with clinical outcomes. Secondly, we will develop a non-invasive, deep learning algorithm for evaluation of regional genetic characteristics of GBM. To train this algorithm, we will acquire imaging-localized surgical biopsies and genetic profiling of GBM patients undergoing surgery. Once trained, the algorithm can be used to non- invasively identify clonal populations and track genetic changes associated with clinical outcomes during the course of treatment. The development of these deep learning algorithms will transform physician’s capacity for clinical decision-making and dramatically improve outcomes for a devastating disease. Project Narrative The proposed research will provide automatic deep-learning tools to aid clinical decision-making for glioblastoma, the most common primary adult brain tumor that carries a dismal prognosis. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment.

"Implementation of Machine Learning Workflows in Primary Brain Tumor Diagnostics Abstract The diagnosis of primary brain tumors requires a layered approach of histologic, anatomic and molecular features to generate an integrated diagnosis with clinical and prognostic significance. The diagnostic workup of diffuse gliomas in particular requires a panel of immunohistochemical stains with a subset of tumors requiring additional molecular testing to reach a diagnostic category recognized by the World Health Organization. In the United States and worldwide, scarce resources are available to perform these tests, so methods that improve pre-test probabilities and decrease false positive results have significant clinical and financial impact. Our long-term goal is to improve and standardize testing and diagnoses for brain tumor patients worldwide by validating new diagnostic workflows using digital imaging, immunohistochemical tests, open source computing platforms and machine learning algorithms to improve diagnostic capabilities. We will achieve these goals by completing three specific aims in this R03 Pilot/Feasibility project. First, we will determine the extent to which predictive diagnostic models developed from public domain data show generalizability to cases evaluated at a tertiary brain cancer care center. We have already generated a prototype statistical predictive model, which we will expand to all CNS tumor types and test with data from patients at James Cancer Hospital. Second, we will generate and validate models that predict the probability of false-positive 1p/19q FISH testing using histological features from OLIG2-immunostained brain tumor slides obtained from whole slide imaging. Lastly, we will consolidate data containing whole slide digital images, immunohistochemical features, clinical data and molecular features of diffuse gliomas. Consolidating these data will allow us to begin data analysis correlating histological images to immunohistochemical and molecular features. This dataset will represent the core dataset that upon which we will base our next R01-level proposal. To achieve these goals, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team composed of an image analysis expert and neuropathologist (JO), a molecular neuropathologist (DT), and a high dimensionality bioinformaticist (JZ). The Ohio State University is the first US cancer center to transition to complete whole slide imaging, and therefore we are in a unique position to generate a significant, vertical advance in improving diagnostic accuracy in neuropathology with modern Pathology Informatics approaches. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop predictive models of cancer diagnoses and consolidate various forms of patient data into one centralized source for research. This new knowledge will ultimately serve as the framework upon which interventions are designed that may improve morbidity and mortality of patients with primary brain tumors. Therefore, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burdens of human disease.",Implementation of Machine Learning Workflows in Primary Brain Tumor Diagnostics,9954242,R03NS116334,"['19q', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'CDKN2A gene', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Cancer Patient', 'Categories', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'FDA approved', 'Geographic state', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Hospitals', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Ohio', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Probability', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'World Health Organization', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'high dimensionality', 'histological image', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutant', 'neuropathology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic significance', 'prototype', 'sequencing platform', 'therapy design', 'tumor', 'whole slide imaging']",NINDS,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,156000,-0.014554640227090304
"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9886248,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,628575,0.009762189878620254
"Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT In the U.S., more than 600,000 knee osteoarthritis (OA)-related total knee joint replacement (TKR) cases are reported every year, exceeding $17 billion estimated direct costs annually. There is a growing need for disease- modifying therapies that prevent or delay the need for TKR. However, development of such therapies remains challenging due to the lack of objective and measurable OA biomarkers for disease progression. The course of the OA is highly variable between individuals and the OA progresses too slowly, making it difficult to identify sensitive OA biomarkers capable of capturing minor changes on the knee joint. This has slowed development of effective therapies and prevents physicians from providing the most effective advice about minimizing the need for TKR. In this project, our goal is to develop imaging biomarkers to monitor minor OA-related changes in knee joint health that lead to TKR. To achieve this goal, we will combine novel deep learning algorithms with clinical and imaging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The OAI dataset includes clinical data, biospecimens, radiographs, and magnetic resonance (MR) images collected over 8 years. The proposed project has three Specific Aims: (i) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from the bilateral posteroanterior fixed-flexion knee radiographs using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); (ii) to develop an automated OA-relevant biomarker identification tool from structural and compositional MR images using 3D CNNs with RNNs combined with the OA progression outcome of subjects (n = 882); and (iii) to determine whether deep learning–based imaging biomarkers can act as surrogates to predict the OA progression using a subject cohort (n = 296) independent of the cohort used to identify imaging biomarkers. The proposed project will couple deep learning with diagnostic radiology to unveil key combinations of OA-relevant features directly from images with minimal user interaction. This will facilitate fast individualized assessment of OA progression using whole knee joint images directly. If successful, this study will bring new insights into the development of imaging biomarkers for OA progression and more broadly into our understanding and treatment of OA. The knowledge gained in this project will help to advance close monitoring of OA progression by opening new perspectives on the regions and parameters for potential inclusion in both intervention studies and clinical practice. NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disorder of joints and is the most common reason leading to total knee joint replacement. Our proposed study aims to develop a novel automated OA-relevant imaging biomarker identification system based on radiographs, magnetic resonance images, and deep learning methods to study knee OA progression. We will address whether combining deep learning algorithms with medical images will determine the key combinations of features relevant to knee OA that are required to accurately predict the OA progression outcome.",Deep Learning-based Imaging Biomarkers for Knee Osteoarthritis,9970413,R01AR074453,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'tool']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,497020,0.016283299545927006
"Development and Dissemination of KiNet: A Novel Imaging Informatics Tool for Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are one heterogeneous type of cancer affecting most organ systems. NETs must be correctly graded to ensure proper treatment and patient management. The proliferation index, as measured by Ki67 nuclear staining, is required for gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic NET grading per the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Measuring the Ki67 labeling index (Ki67 LI) from pathology images requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. This process is an essential procedure in basic, translational and clinical research and in routine clinical practice. However, current Ki67 image analysis tools have a number of drawbacks: 1) Ki67 LI assessment is still mainly achieved with manual or semi-automated methods, leading to increased labor costs, awkward workflows, low-throughput image analysis and significant potential inter- and intra-observer variability; 2) computer-aided Ki67 counting is error-prone due to the multi-stage image processing design, where each stage itself is a very challenging task; 3) current algorithm design does not take into consideration the characteristics of Ki67 images such that it has technical difficulty in classifying different types of cells in Ki67 stained images. In this proposed research, we seek to develop and disseminate a novel deep learning-based imaging informatics system, KiNeT, specifically for better automated Ki67 LI measurement in GI and pancreatic NETs. KiNet will take advantage of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs), to develop an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel model for single-stage Ki67 LI assessment. To this end, we will first formulate Ki67 counting as a cell identification problem and solve it using class-aware structured regression modeling within a novel FCN network. This network will simultaneously detect and classify immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. Next, we will further enhance cell identification with another related task, extraction of regions of interest (ROIs), which will differentiate tumor from non-tumor regions by taking Ki67 image characteristics into consideration. These two tasks will be unified into one single neural network and jointly learned to benefit both cell identification and region classification. KiNet will provide a novel computational method for accurate Ki67 LI assessment, thereby enabling early detection and targeted treatments of the diseases. Compared to manual counting and current Ki67 image analysis methods, it will significantly improve the objectivity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility and efficiency. Additionally, the proposed single-stage Ki67 counting strategy, which is completely different from current multi-stage Ki67 image analysis pipelines, will provide a new perspective for Ki67 image quantification. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ki67 labeling index (LI) is a reliable and critical biomarker to grade gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). This biomarker computation requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells.

"Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning Project Summary Positron-emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality that allows clinicians and researchers to study the physiological or pathological processes of the human body, and in particular the brain via the use of specific tracers. For brain PET imaging, patient head movement during scanning presents a challenge for accurate PET image reconstruction and subsequent quantitative analysis. Problems due to head motion are exacerbated by the long duration of the scans, with scan times commonly over one hour. Furthermore, some PET studies specifically involve subjects that either have trouble staying still due to psychological variations, e.g. patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, or psychological variations, e.g. subjects with anxiety disorders, or are required to participate in tasks that involve movement, e.g. smoking cigarettes while scanning. In brain scans, the average head motion can vary from 7 mm in clinical scans to triple this amount for longer research scans. Quantitatively, a 5 mm head motion can produce biases of up to ~35% in regional intensities and ∼15% in volume of distribution estimates, which could much larger than the difference observed in regional intensities or binding potential that distinguish different demographic groups being studied. The ability to track and correct head motion, therefore, would be of high utility in both clinical and research PET studies. In the past, many motion correction methods have been proposed. However, except for hardware-based approaches, there has been no method that can track frequent head motion on-the-fly during the PET acquisition. Hardware-based approaches are not readily available for clinical translation or used by other research facilities due to highly-customized software/hardware setup. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a data-driven methodology using deep learning to track and estimate rigid head motion using PET raw data, and incorporate both tracer type and time as conditional variables into this deep neural network design in order to handle diverse PET tracer types and their dynamic behavior. Overall, these solutions will provide for a data-driven motion estimation methodology to improve the quality of PET imaging. Specifically, we will start with the development and testing of our methodology for rigid head motion estimation using single-tracer PET raw data. Then we will perform evaluation of our multi-tracer motion estimation methodology applied to real PET data with a diverse range of tracers. Finally, in the exploratory phase, we will integrate time-of-flight information into deep learning-based motion prediction. The significance of this proposal is that it will allow for improved quality of PET imaging in real time and potentially allow for its use in clinical PET systems that do not have special motion tracking hardware. This work will serve as a first step towards developing data-driven motion estimation algorithms for full body PET imaging. The innovation lies in the development of what is a data-driven solution to the problem of real time motion estimation. Project Narrative Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain is a highly useful tool for biomedical research and clinical practice. Head motion during scanning degrades PET image quality and introduces image artifacts. We propose to develop new data-driven methods, based on PET raw data, to estimate head motion using deep learning, which can be used for real time motion estimation in PET imaging.",Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning,9877261,R21EB028954,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological Processes', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Smoking', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neural network', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'research facility', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,243150,0.02353954592837856
"Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease Abstract Vascular health has been shown to be an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Hence, the ability to measure reliably and quantitatively early hemodynamic changes in the aging brain can be a powerful tool for diagnosing, studying, and developing treatments. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging can yield quantitative perfusion images without the use of contrast agents. We propose that combining new ASL techniques, such as Velocity Selective Inversion (VSI) labeling pulses and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) with deep learning regression methods will allow quantification of multiple hemodynamic parameters beyond perfusion, thus providing a much more nuanced picture of the state of the vasculature. We also expect that the new technique will offer dramatic improvements in SNR, specificity and sensitivity of ASL, and that the proposed techniques will have many other applications in research and in the clinic. We propose to use these techniques to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between vascular changes and Parkinson’s disease and its symptoms, particularly fatigue, whose pathogenesis is not well understood. If we are successful in this application, future work will use the hemodynamic parameters of interest as biomarkers to assess risk of neurodegeneration, determine therapeutic targets, and guide in the development of new therapies. Public Health Statement Vascular health is an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases We propose to develop a method that can produce quantifiable images of multiple blood flow related parameters with a single scan and without the use of contrast injections.

"Machine learning for fast motion compensated quantitative abdominal DCE-MRI Project Summary: Functional imaging with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) provides important physiological markers of permeability, perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a measure of kidney function, without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. DCE-MR images are at the same time used for evaluation of anatomy. Functional markers from DCE-MRI, if computed accurately, would play a critical role in diagnosing and assessing the progression of a number of pediatric diseases including those compromising kidney function, liver diseases, tumors, and Crohn's disease. One of the most important applications of DCE-MRI is assessing kidney function (GFR) in hydronephrosis patients with obstruction. In the absence of GFR information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgical reconstruction might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment, and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., “watchful waiting”) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information, it is slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. There is a clinical need for accurate computation of quantitative functional markers. Unfortunately, current methods of DCE-MRI in neonates and children are less than optimal, and therefore, DCE-MRI is underutilized in clinical practice. The technical challenges include insufficient temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function (AIF) dynamics (which are required for accurate computation of quantitative markers), unavoidable respiratory motion and bulk motion (which reduce image quality and significantly lower the accuracy of parameter estimates), and a lack of robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate computation of markers. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI method addressing these challenges. The primary objective of this exploratory, three-year study, is three-fold: first, to develop and evaluate a new bulk and respiratory motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI technique for accurate estimation of functional markers; second, to further improve the robustness and speed of DCE-MRI using a fast, deep learning (DL) technique with integrated temporal prior for the reconstruction of motion-compensated, higher quality, high temporal resolution images; and third, to develop an automatic quantitative analysis pipeline including segmentation and tracer kinetic model-fitting using DL techniques for fast, robust and accurate quantification of functional markers. The successful completion of these aims will provide new, clinically important abdominal imaging capabilities, with real-time, motion-compensated image reconstruction and reliable real-time parameter estimation from high temporal and spatial resolution DCE-MRI. This work will extend the usefulness of DCE-MRI to pediatric patients who are unable to remain still in the scanner, and eliminate the need for repeated scans and sedation in infants. ! !

"Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials Project Summary / Abstract In patients with lymphomas and other cancers, quantitative evaluation of the extent of tumor burden is im- portant for staging, restaging, and assessment of therapeutic response or relapse; yet measurement of overall tumor burden is challenging with current tools, particularly when lymph nodes are confluent or difficult to fully differentiate from surrounding structures. Precision medicine and novel therapeutics are emphasizing the need to introduce a risk-adapted approach to tailor appropriate treatment strategies for cancer patients. The ability to quantitatively assess cancer phenotypes with functional and anatomical imaging that could efficiently and ac- curately map patients to gene expression profiling, clinical information, matching cohorts, and novel treatment regimens could potentially result in more optimal management of patients with cancer.  This Academic-Industry Partnership aims to translate recently developed technologies for semi- automated image segmentation and quantification of lymph nodes into robust tools and integrate them into an existing cloud-based system for management of multicenter oncology clinical trials. The ability to semi- automatically segment lymph node pathology with computed tomography (CT), as well as quantify nodal me- tabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) will enable comprehensive tracking of morphological and functional changes related to disease progression and treatment response.  Since 2004, the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center's (DF/HCC) Tumor Imaging Metrics Core (TIMC) has developed the Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC (PIM) platform to manage clinical trial image assessment workflows. Currently, there are nearly 50,000 consistently measured lymph node measurements in the TIMC database. The PIM system is used to make over 20,000 time point imaging assessments per year at eight NCI- designated Cancer Centers and aims to grow quickly by transitioning to a fully cloud-hosted system.  Given sufficient training data, state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technolo- gies can meet or even exceed human performance on specific imaging analysis tasks. Recent studies have indicated that AI-based lymph node segmentation from CT scans is nearing human performance levels, and we will extend and translate this work into a commercial tool. Specifically, our aim is to translate recent ad- vancements in AI-based segmentation into deployable services, and integrate these services into the clinical trial workflow. The proposed system will be designed to incorporate expert feedback provided by image ana- lysts and radiologists back into the ground truth dataset, allowing for continuous improvement in accuracy and clinical acceptance. We will extend our semi-automatic CT segmentation technologies to quantify lymph node metabolism in PET/CT, using lymphoma as the model disease. Integration of these technologies with PIM will provide an ongoing source of consistently measured quantitative data across a network of cancer centers. Project Narrative Advanced quantitative imaging is underutilized in oncologic clinical practice and research because the time investment entailed in manual lesion segmentation remains prohibitive. This partnership proposes to integrate machine learning based quantitative imaging tools into the existing Precision Imaging Metrics, LLC clinical trial image management system. We will use data from the centralized Tumor Imaging Metrics Core at the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center to produce ground truth training data and develop semi-automated multimodali- ty lesion analysis for patients with cancer.",Lymph Node Quantification System for Multisite Clinical Trials,10003193,R01CA235589,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Goals', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'NCI-Designated Cancer Center', 'Nodal', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Services', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Burden', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'glucose metabolism', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'lymph nodes', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'success', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,607952,-0.0007158071090522499
"Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1 Project Summary Glaucoma is a leading cause of vision morbidity and blindness worldwide. Early disease detection and sensitive monitoring of progression are crucial to allow timely treatment for preservation of vision. The introduction of ocular imaging technologies significantly improves these capabilities, but in clinical practice there are still substantial challenges at certain stages of the disease severity spectrum, specifically in the early stage and in advanced disease. These difficulties are due to a variety of causes that change over the course of the disease, including large between-subject variability, inherent measurement variability, image quality, varying dynamic ranges of measurements, minimal measurable level of tissues, etc. In this proposal, we build on our long-standing contribution to ocular imaging and propose novel and sensitive means to detect glaucoma and its progression that are optimized to the various stages of disease severity. We will use information gathered from visual fields (functional information) and a leading ocular imaging technology – optical coherence tomography (OCT; structural information) to map the capability of detecting changes across the entire disease severity spectrum to identify optimal parameters for each stage of the disease. Both commonly used parameters provided by the technologies and newly developed parameters with good diagnostic potential will be analyzed. We will use state-of-the-art automated computerized machine learning methods, namely the deep learning approach, to identify structural features embedded within OCT images that are associated with glaucoma and its progression without any a priori assumptions. This will provide novel insight into structural information, and has shown very encouraging preliminary results. We will also utilize a new imaging technology, the visible light OCT, to generate retinal images with outstanding resolution to extract information about the oxygen saturation of the tissue. This will provide in-vivo, real time, and noninvasive insight into tissue functionality. Taken together, this program will advance the use of structural and functional information with a substantial impact on the clinical management of subjects with glaucoma Project Narrative This research proposal is focusing on the development and refinement of innovative analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies that will substantially improve detection of glaucoma and its progression monitoring in order to prevent blindness.",Novel Glaucoma Diagnostics for Structure and Function  - Renewal - 1,10019553,R01EY013178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Blindness', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Floor', 'Future', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Inner Plexiform Layer', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Pathology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissue Extracts', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Visible Radiation', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Width', 'advanced disease', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'density', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'invention', 'knowledge base', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'macula', 'mathematical methods', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'ocular imaging', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research study', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'tissue oxygenation', 'tool']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,687519,-0.0008516641622028167
"Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response Abstract  The continuing goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective imaging-based strategies to personalize brain tumor treatment. Current Response Assessment in NeuroOncology (RANO) criteria, which incorporate anatomic imaging only, are insufficient for distinguishing tumor from treatment effect (TE). Without definitive confirmation of tumor progression, no treatment changes are recommended for several months after standard therapies. Thus, patients are precluded from switching to potentially more effective therapies—a limitation that could be overcome with more reliable imaging techniques.  To this end, during the previous funding cycle, we demonstrated the feasibility of several quantitative imaging (QI) tools to reliably distinguish tumor from treatment effect and predict treatment response. These QI tools include a machine-learning approach to calibrate T1w images enabling the creation of quantitative delta T1 (qDT1) maps. The qDT1 enable the detection of true contrast enhancing lesion volume (CELV). The qDT1 together with our proven dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI methods, for determination of rCBV (relative cerebral blood volume), are used to generate a new biomarker, fractional tumor burden (FTB), to delineate the extent of tumor within CELV on a voxel-wise basis. These perfusion-based QI tools in combination with our diffusion MRI technology, which includes functional diffusion maps (FDMs) and more recently RSI (restriction spectrum imaging), provide a comprehensive assessment of brain tumor and its distinction from treatment effect.  Now, in order to translate this technology for use in clinical trials and daily practice, some final updates and clinical validation studies are needed as proposed here. First, to ease adoption and testing in the clinical setting improvements are proposed for the individual QI technologies along with the development of a streamlined workflow (Aim 1). To improve the widespread adoption of DSC-MRI and FTB biomarker, studies will be performed to confirm that a single-dose DSC-MRI method can replace the standard double-dose method without affecting the accuracy of rCBV or the creation of FTB maps (Aim 1.1). Also, registration and segmentation algorithms will be updated to include deformable registration and recent advances in deep learning for longitudinal reporting of CELV, non-enhancing lesion volumes (NELV) and each of the QI metrics (Aim 1.2). Finally, a streamlined workflow that incorporates these improvements will be created (Aim 1.3). The Aim 2 studies will test the QI tools and workflow using clinical trial data (Aim 2.1-2.2) and daily clinical practice (Aim 2.3-2.4).  Clinical validation of this new QI-RANO workflow, with evidence showing improved prediction in comparison to current measures, has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how brain tumor burden is assessed. Project Narrative The goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective quantitative imaging (QI)-based strategies to provide earlier indications of brain tumor treatment response than is currently available. The QI tools, which include novel quantitative measures of enhancing lesion (qDT1), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), fractional tumor burden (FTB) and functional diffusion maps (fDM) will be updated and validated in the context of clinical trials. Working in close collaboration with an industrial partner, the proven methods will be translated into a software platform for widespread use within the quantitative imaging network (QIN), and for both clinical trials and daily standard of care.",Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response,10006506,U01CA176110,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Funding', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predisposition', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Update', 'Validation', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cerebral blood volume', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'validation studies']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,U01,2020,559217,0.055211483359498846
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9989025,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,612684,0.000444859548151641
"Machine learning accelerated on-line adaptive replanning Abstract. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and test a novel machine learning (ML) accelerated On-Line Adaptive Replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided radiation therapy (RT) (MRgRT). During the multi-fraction RT process, the location, shape and size of tumors and normal organs vary significantly between the fractions. These interfraction variations are among the major factors that can limit the accuracy of RT targeting. The current standard practice of image-guided RT (IGRT), developed to address the interfraction variations based on cone-beam CT (CBCT), can only correct for translational errors, and thus does not fully account for interfraction changes. To address this issue, researchers recently introduced online adaptive replanning (OLAR) that generates a new plan based on the anatomy of the day and delivers the plan for the fraction. Currently, two main obstacles affect the success of OLAR: (1) the anatomy of the day cannot be delineated accurately based on CBCT, and (2) the time required to perform OLAR is long enough to render it impractical. One way to improve the delineation accuracy is to use MRI versus CT. MRI-guided OLAR is currently being introduced into the clinics to substantially improve RT targeting. However, the bottleneck is still the impractical length of time required to segment the anatomy of the day, which can exceed 30 minutes. Furthermore, available synthetic CT (sCT) generation methods are slow or inaccurate for MRI-guided OLAR. There is no method available to quickly and objective determine when OLAR is necessary. To address these issues, we plan to develop novel techniques in the MOLAR solution. We hypothesize that the MRI-based MOLAR solution will fully account for interfraction changes, thereby substantially improving tumor targeting during RT delivery and the effectiveness of RT. Specifically, we aim to (1) develop practical ML-based solutions to quickly determine the necessity of OLAR and to rapidly generate accurate synthetic CTs; (2) develop ML-based techniques to substantially accelerate segmentation for OLAR using a progressive three-step process; and (3) verify clinical practicality and effectiveness of MOLAR by retrospectively and prospectively applying the MOLAR on MRI sets to test its speed and effectiveness in accounting for interfraction variations. We will develop this novel MOLAR solution by forging unique collaborations between clinical physicists, radiation oncologists and industry developers via an established academic-industry partnership. The successful completion of this project will enable clinicians to routinely practice “image-plan-treat”, which is the optimal solution for MRgRT. This new paradigm will fully account for interfraction variations, improve tumor targeting, reduce normal tissue toxicity, and ultimately encourage clinicians to revise the current doses and/or dose fractionations to increase therapeutic gain, enhance patient quality of life, and/or substantially save on healthcare costs. Our proposed strategy represents a drastic departure from current practice. We firmly believe that this strategy is the future of RT delivery. Project Narrative: This R01 application proposes to develop and test a novel machine learning accelerated online adaptive replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided adaptive radiation therapy through a unique academic and industry partnership.

"2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging SUMMARY This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging, a three- day meeting to be held from February 25-27, 2021, which will be the seventh of its kind hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. The requested funds will primarily be used to cover travel and lodging for junior researchers who will be presenting at the workshop: undergraduate, graduate and junior faculty. Some funds may also be allocated to help pay for live webcasting and publication costs related to workshop materials. As with previous meetings, we intend to stream each session of the meeting in real-time, allowing those who are interested in the proceedings but unable to attend in person to access them online for free. As mortalities associated with pulmonary disease continue to rise worldwide, innovative imaging techniques capable of both diagnosing and helping to treat these pathologies are becoming an increasingly important. As a field, pulmonary imaging currently encompasses a wider range of techniques for the structural, functional and molecular assessment of lung disorders than at any time in its history. What is more, these techniques are being developed and optimized by researchers across an increasingly diverse set of fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, computer science and medicine. Given the field's rapidly-evolving nature, the existence of a regular forum in which scientists and clinicians can communicate their ideas with each other is of the utmost importance. Given the absence of other scientific meetings with a similarly focused agenda, our previous workshops have succeeded in providing just such a forum—allowing a diverse group of pulmonary imaging researchers to come together for the kind of rigorous, collaborative exchange that can continue to advance the field. The specific aims of the proposed workshop are as follows: (1) host a one-day workshop on pulmonary inflammation; (2) inform the pulmonary imaging community of the latest advances in structural, functional and molecular lung imaging; (3) explore the use of pulmonary imaging to evaluate therapeutic response, the inherent obstacles to doing so, and strategies to overcome them; (4) investigate new approaches for integrating deep learning and pulmonary imaging techniques to more accurately diagnose and phenotype disease and predict injury progression; (5) broadcast the entire workshop live online, thereby enabling interested parties not in attendance to access the proceedings in real-time, free of charge. Based on the uniformly positive feedback in response to our one-day boot camp on pulmonary physiology prior to the 2019 workshop, we intend to hold another boot camp before the 2021 meeting, this time focused on pulmonary inflammation. This boot camp will consist of ~5 longer presentations (approximately 1 hour each) on topics related to this central theme, with significant time devoted to question and answer after each, and a final discussion panel aimed at synthesizing the most important issues covered over the course of the day. In addition to this exciting addition to the format, the 2021 workshop will again seek a more equitable balance between functional, structural and molecular imaging approaches to pulmonary disease across the invited talks, while also continuing to expand our recent focus on the topics of imaging assessments of treatment response and the integration of imaging techniques with machine learning. Finally, the 2021 workshop add a session on bridging the gap between current clinical practice and innovative imaging technologies. NARRATIVE This application requests funding to support the 2021 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging at the University of Pennsylvania. This recurring workshop provides a necessary and valuable opportunity for researchers working in the fields of functional, structural, and molecular imaging technique development for assessing lung diseases such as lung cancer, COPD, IPF and ARDS to come together in order to discuss and share their work.

"An interactive deep-learning method to semi-automatically segment abdominal organs to support stereotactic MR guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) for abdominal cancers Abstract  Stereotactic MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) is an effective treatment for the pancreas and other upper abdominal cancers. SMART allows precise delivery of escalated prescription dose to the abdominal tumor targets while avoiding the complications of radiation toxicity to the mobile gastrointestinal (GI) organs surrounding the tumor target. In the clinical workflow of SMART, manual segmentation of the GI orangs at risk (OARs) is one of the most important but also the most labor-intensive steps. Manual segmentation takes 10 minutes on average but ranges from 5 to 22 minutes. The slow and costly manual segmentation step directly decreases the accessibility and affordability of online SMART and indirectly reduces the effectiveness of SMART due to intra-fractional body and organ movement of the patients. In this study, we will develop a deep-learning based interactive and semi-automatic procedure to accurately and quickly segment the GI OARs to make SMART more efficient and affordable. Stereotactic MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) has been demonstrated as an effective treatment for the pancreas and other upper abdominal cancers. For nonresectable pancreatic cancer, SMART increased the overall survival at 36 months from 18% to 55% compared to conventional radiation therapy (RT) treatment. In this study, we will develop a deep-learning based interactive and semi-automatic method to accurately and quickly segment the organs-at- risk (OAR) in the abdomen to support SMART. The method to be developed will significantly expedite the OAR segmentation step and make SMART more efficient and affordable.",An interactive deep-learning method to semi-automatically segment abdominal organs to support stereotactic MR guided online adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) for abdominal cancers,10017990,R03EB028427,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Clinical', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dose', 'Dose-Rate', 'Duodenum', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Kidney', 'Large Intestine', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of abdomen', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Toxicity', 'Radiation therapy', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Small Intestines', 'Stomach', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'gastrointestinal', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'irradiation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preservation', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'tumor']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,74942,-0.003267514696470356
"Neuroimaging Analysis Center (NAC) Project Summary/Abstract The ability to access huge cohorts of patient medical records and radiology data, the emergence of ever-more detailed imaging modalities, and the availability of unprecedented computer processing power marks the pos- sibility for a new era in neuroimaging, disease understanding, and patient treatment. To unlock the full medical potential made possible by these new technologies, new algorithms and clinically-relevant techniques must be developed by close collaboration between computer scientists, physicians, and medical researchers. We are excited to propose a national resource center with the goal of finding new ways of extracting disease characteristics from advanced imaging and computation, and to make these methods available to the larger medical community through a proven methodology of world-class research, open-source software, and exten- sive collaboration. The overarching theme for this P41 renewal is the discovery and analysis of novel imaging phenotypes to characterize disease. We use the term imaging phenotypes to describe patterns or features of disease that can be detected through imaging (predominantly MRI) followed by machine learning, statistical analysis, feature detection, and correlation with other indicators of disease such as structured patient infor- mation. The three proposed Technology Research & Development (TR&D) projects address this common question us- ing a variety of complementary approaches and clinical testbeds. TR&D 1 addresses microstructure of tissue, including novel imaging methods to detect tumor microstructure. TR&D 2 investigates rich spatial patterns of disease extracted from clinical imaging with a focus on cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke. Finally, TR&D 3 proposes novel image and connectivity-based features that can be correlated with a variety of diseases, with a clinical emphasis on pediatric brain development. Technical innovation will be driven by intense collaboration between the TR&Ds and key collaborators in neurosurgery, neurology, and pe- diatrics. The TR&Ds will leverage recent important developments in the fields of image acquisition, machine learning, and data science to identify and exploit novel imaging phenotypes of disease. Building on our long history of developing clinically-relevant methods, each TR&D includes a translational and clinical validation aim to ensure our work is clinically relevant and effective at meeting the driving clinical goals. NAC's proven software engi- neering, translation, and dissemination infrastructure, along with its established network of academic, medical, and industrial partners, enhance the center's value as a national resource.

"IEEE Medical Imaging Conference Abstract  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) is the leading international scientific meeting bringing together a broad community interested in the physics, engineering and mathematical aspects of medical imaging, with special emphasis on nuclear medicine and multi-modal systems. The MIC runs in conjunction with the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) and the Workshop on Room Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors (RTSD).  The purpose of the MIC is to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. While the traditional topics of primary interest are related to nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), increasing space will be also given to recently evolving imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, optical, MR, with special emphasis on their multi-modal combination with nuclear medical imaging. Recently there has also been additional interest in employing deep learning and AI to enhance the field medical imaging. The conference provides a well-established forum of scientific exchange and dialogue between researchers in academia, industry, and government as well as education of the public, with special emphasis on young generations. This is reflected by the large spectrum of educational refresher sessions and short courses. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks $10,000 in funding for each of the next three years to provide 20 trainee grants of $500 each to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration, housing and/or short course fees for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions.  We anticipate that the main impact of this grant program will be to increase attendance of students and postdocs at the 2020 meeting, especially those typically underrepresented, as well as to support their participation in educational activities. It is important to bring young generations, especially women, minorities, and those with disabilities, into the medical imaging field, where they could become main actors in the coming years. They will attend plenary and oral presentations given by many of the world leaders in the nuclear medical imaging instrumentation, image processing, and quantitative analysis fields. Moreover, they will be given the unique opportunity of direct personal interaction through the short courses and dedicated poster presentations. In turn their work will be exposed to the other participants for critical evaluation, constructive suggestions and dissemination. Furthermore, many of these trainees will likely continue in this field, thereby contributing to advancing technology with high societal relevance as being increasingly used in the clinical management of disease and therapeutic interventions. Narrative  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) has the purpose to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. The conference covers a variety of medical imaging topics including quantitative imaging, PET/SPECT techniques, image reconstruction, imaging in radiation therapy, portable imaging, multi-modality systems, new medical imaging technologies, CT/MR/optical/ultrasound, parametric/kinetic image modeling, and signal/image processing and modeling.

"Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers Project Summary Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) has been proposed as a technique to quantify tissue parameters, such as T1 and T2 relaxation times, which are biomarkers for various pathologies. One assumption of MRF is that the signal in each voxel is generated by exactly one set of tissue parameters. Due to MRI resolution at the range of millimeter in combination with the cellular structure of biological tissue, each voxel consists of multiple tissue compartments. An over-simplified single compartment model results in apparent relaxation times that are influenced by the relaxation times and the fractional proton densities of all contributing compartments. This can lead to a misinterpretation of signal changes. For example, in diseases that causes demyelination in white matter (Multiple Sclerosis, Dementia), a reduction of the myelin water fraction would result in a misleading change of the apparent relaxation time of the voxel. We propose a multi-compartment MRF method that allows to identify multiple tissue contributions within a voxel, including the fractional proton density (PD) of different compartments. Our machine learning based approach automatically identifies the number of compartments within each voxel that can be identified with the available SNR in that voxel. We will correct for partial-volume effects at the borders of two types of tissues, as well as analyze tissue microstructure. For the second case our learned model will also include chemical exchange between compartments. After an initial validation phase using numerical simulations, we will first perform MRF scans of dedicated 3D printed phantoms with multiple compartments. Our quality criterion is successful estimation of all simulated tissue compartments for all voxels with a relative error of less than 5% to the ground truth. We will then perform in-vivo MRF measurements of healthy volunteers (n=5). We will generate synthetic FLAIR and MP-RAGE contrasts from parameter maps estimated with conventional and the proposed multi-compartment MRF technique. We will compare them with currently used clinical contrasts acquired using established pulse sequences and validate the performance of our approach by measuring the cortical thickness. Further, we will validate the performance for microstructure composition in white matter. Our hypothesis is that it will be possible separate the compartments for myelin, intra- and extra-cellular water and compare the results to ex-vivo data found in literature. In summary, the methods developed in this R21 proposal will provide a novel technique to accurately and reproducibly identify biomarkers beyond the resolution of a voxel. It will allow to identify changes in tissue composition and fractional proton density at the microstructure level. Project Narrative The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish a MR imaging technique for quantifying biomarkers at the sub-voxel level. We will develop a machine learning based MR fingerprinting image reconstruction that enables the identification and characterization of multiple compartments within a voxel in terms of fractional proton density and relaxation times. We will generate accurate synthetic fluid suppressed images such as the FLAIR and MP- RAGE with accurate partial volume behavior and analyze the myelin water fraction and the corresponding relaxation times in white matter.",Development of Multi-Compartment MR-Fingerprinting for Subvoxel Estimation of Quantitative Tissue Biomarkers,10016296,R21EB027241,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'conditioning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'millimeter', 'neuroimaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tissue biomarkers', 'white matter']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2020,252175,0.02055960002243953
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9982672,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'random forest', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,601618,-0.006103597702349865
"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9895669,R01CA197000,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Burden', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Image', 'In complete remission', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Property', 'Registries', 'Residual Cancers', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'computerized tools', 'experimental arm', 'falls', 'feature extraction', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'secondary endpoint', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,486817,0.049247591432158004
"SBIR Phase I Topic 402: Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring Image-based evaluation of lymph nodes is an essential step in cancer diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. Current clinical practice mostly uses qualitative or semi-quantitative measures in evaluation and thus suffers from inaccuracy due to intra- and inter-observer variability and increased human efforts. This becomes a more serious issue in head and neck cancers due to the large number of clinically relevant lymph nodes. In this project an AI-based automatic segmentation software will be developed for quantitative cervical lymph node evaluation to increase the accuracy and reduce the cost. However, there are a few challenges in developing and deploying such a software due to different clinical practices such as usage of different modalities (MRI and/or CT) and complex clinical workflow. To address these challenges, a novel AI algorithm that can handle the variability in imaging modalities and support incremental learning using site-specific data to enhance its robustness will be developed; a private-cloud-based software framework with high usability will then be developed to incorporate this algorithm and provide advanced visualization and reporting for clinical usage. This software will have high impact on all stages of patient care for head and neck cancers and can be further extended to other cancers. n/a","SBIR Phase I Topic 402: Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring",10269836,5N91020C00048,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cervical lymph node group', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Reporting', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Framework', 'Visualization', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer prevention', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'imaging modality', 'lymph nodes', 'novel', 'segmentation algorithm', 'usability']",NCI,"CARINA MEDICAL, LLC",N43,2020,400000,-0.004558880355002824
"Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods Project Summary / Abstract  Hybrid PET/MRI systems are very advantageous for a variety of clinical applications by combining the soft tissue contrast of MRI with the functional and metabolic information of PET. These systems have found success for oncology studies, particularly in head and abdomen/pelvis, as well as for epilepsy, neurological diseases, heart disease, and pediatrics for dose reduction. However, the PET resolution and SNR is typically worse than MRI, and suffers from the loss of feature and data due to motion as well. PET/MRI systems offer the potential to create more accurate, higher resolution PET reconstructions, including correction of artifacts, motion, and im- proved localization, by performing synergistic reconstructions that leverage the simultaneous data acquisition. In particular, this fellowship proposes to develop novel physics-constrained machine learning models for informa- tion sharing between PET and MRI for enhanced spatial localization, estimation of attenuation and activity, and motion. We propose to develop a deep maximum-likelihood estimation of attenuation and activity (MLAA) that can compensate for artifacts and improve PET reconstruction accuracy. We also propose a motion-enhanced joint PET/MRI reconstruction to capture arbitrary motions and reduce dose requirements for chest and abdomen studies. Together, these models aim to improve the PET spatio-temporal resolution, SNR, and quantiﬁcation for a broad range of clinical applications, and will be evaluated for cancer assessment in the pelvis, liver, and lung.  This fellowship will be performed in the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at UCSF under the guidance of Prof. Peder Larson, who leads a research program on advanced imaging methods development, and Dr. Thomas Hope, a radiologist and nuclear medicine physician who leads multiple PET/MRI projects. The Department is one of the leading centers in biomedical imaging research, and has been at the forefront on translating PET/MRI systems into clinical practice. The UCSF PET/MRI scanner has dedicated research time, which is also available on other MRI and PET/CT research systems, and extensive computational resources to support the proposed project. The applicant, Dr. Abhejit Rajagopal, has a background in computational imaging and machine learning, will be jointly mentored by this engineer/physician team. He will be trained to become a biomedical imaging scientist by participating in formal coursework on medical imaging systems, training on the PET/MRI system, grant writing, and performing clinical research, supporting his development into a creative, independent biomedical researcher. Project Narrative  Hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) imaging systems cur- rently aid in diagnosis and prognosis of numerous types of cancer and disease, but are not always precise enough to accurately measure and track a patient’s response to therapy, particularly in organs and tissue that are sub- ject to motion. There is an unrealized potential here to synergistically combine complimentary PET-MRI data to dramatically improve the spatial resolution and SNR of PET, as well as to create motion-resolved 4D (x,y,z,t) imagery by combining information across modalities and time-frames to combat severe undersampling. These methods will be evaluated in human studies of cancer to capture ﬁne structure and micro-features on moving organs (e.g. lung nodules, liver metastases), ultimately aiding in quantitative characterization of disease.",Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods,10069132,F32EB030411,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Chest', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Fellowship', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Implant', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Oncology', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Writing', 'attenuation', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'combat', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'imaging scientist', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'information model', 'lung imaging', 'method development', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'systems research', 'uptake']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,69426,0.04191349939361096
"SBIR Phase I Topic 402 - Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring Thermal ablation systems are typically accompanied by ablation treatment planning system to optimize the treatment outcome using pre-operative CT scan. Radiomics is a process of converting medical images into higher-dimensional data and subsequent mining of data to reveal underlying pathophysiology for enhancing clinical decision support making. Radiomics analysis have shown promises in capturing distinct tumor characteristics and predicting prognosis of the tumor. We propose innovative method to calculate microwave ablation zones by supplementing a bioheat transfer model of microwave tissue ablation with microwave sensitive radiomics features, which will generate more accurate and personalized ablation prediction leading to better treatment outcome. Inputs to the bioheat transfer modeling approach include the geometry of the target tumor, physical properties of the tissue, and dimensions of the microwave ablation applicator. The radiomics algorithm extracts properties of the targeted tumor’s size and shape, as well as texture from CT images. Therefore, shape, size, and texture data computed through 3D wavelets are employed as radiomics features for more accurate dose prediction. The proposed radiomics analysis is conducted in three stages: (1)automatic detection of candidate tumors, (2)automatic segmentation of a selected tumor, (3)extraction of features from the segmented tumor, (4)analysis of ablated tumor over period of time. n/a","SBIR Phase I Topic 402 - Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring",10269839,5N91020C00050,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Characteristics', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Image', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiofrequency Interstitial Ablation', 'Shapes', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Texture', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer prevention', 'clinical decision support', 'cloud based', 'data mining', 'feature extraction', 'innovation', 'microwave ablation', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'multidimensional data', 'outcome forecast', 'physical property', 'preclinical study', 'radiomics', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"PHENOMAPPER, LLC",N43,2020,398952,0.010701495805550994
"Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) Overall Project Summary  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.  The world of biomedical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered imaging hardware are now beginning to be accomplished in software, increasingly informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. Information once pursued through the laborious acquisition of carefully separated image datasets is now being derived from newly integrated, and richly quantitative, data streams. In keeping with these themes, our Center will be organized around the following four Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects going forward: 1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. 2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: Flexible, self-correcting, multisensor machines. 3. Enriching the Data Stream: MRI and PET in concert. 4. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.  In each of these projects, we aim to push medical imaging technology to the next level, both in hardware and in software. Having made great strides in developing rapid, continuous imaging data streams, we will next aim to add key new information to those streams, both from physics-driven microstructural modeling and from data- driven machine learning. Having focused on the development of robust tools for image acquisition and reconstruction, we will extend the pipeline to image interpretation, using the results of human- or machine- derived evaluations of image content as feedback for the further improvement of acquisition strategies and sensor designs. We will also aim to close the loop between diagnostic sensing and therapeutic intervention, exploring new ways to guide therapy with continuously-acquired information about tissue bioeffects.  Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TR&D projects as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.  In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies widely available, for the advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them. Overall Project Narrative  The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) develops novel imaging techniques and technologies for the improved diagnosis and management of cancer, musculoskeletal disease, neurological disease and other disorders with a profound impact on human health.

"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9926311,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,348620,0.020772473631538193
"Quantitative MRI for Pediatric Optic Pathway Glioma Treatment Response ABSTRACT  Low-grade glioma is the most common brain tumor in children and often involves one or more structures of the anterior visual pathway (i.e., optic nerves, chiasm and tracts). Nearly 20% of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) will develop a low-grade glioma of the anterior visual pathway, which are called optic pathway gliomas (OPGs). NF1-OPGs are not amenable to surgical resection and can cause permanent vision loss ranging from a mild decline in visual acuity to complete blindness. Children with NF1-OPGs typically experience vision loss between 1 and 8 years of age and are monitored with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess disease progression. However, traditional two-dimensional (2D) measures of tumor size are not appropriate to assess change over time and how NF1-OPGs are responding to treatment.  Our proposal addresses the lack of robust and standardized quantitative imaging (QI) tools and methods needed for NF1-OPG clinical trials. We will develop and validate a novel three-dimensional (3D) MRI-based QI application for automated and comprehensive quantification of these unique pediatric tumors. We will use machine learning algorithms to accommodate MRI sequences from different manufacturers and protocols. We hypothesize that the novel QI application will accurately assess treatment response in clinical trials. In this project, we will validate our QI software and machine learning methods to make accurate and automated measures of tumor volume and shape using data from a phase 3 clinical trial of NF1-OPGs. From these measures, we will create methods to assess response to therapy that will enable physicians to make informed and objective treatment decisions.  Our specific aims are: 1) Develop a comprehensive QI application to perform accurate automated quantification of NF1-OPGs; 2) Determine and predict treatment response using our 3D QI measures of tumor volume; and 3) Validate our 3D QI measures using visual acuity outcomes.  Upon study completion, our QI application could transform clinical care for NF1-OPG by identifying the earliest time to determine a favorable versus unfavorable treatment response. The QI application's ability to accurately measure treatment response, along with harmonizing data across MRI manufacturers and protocols, will standardize imaging assessments essential to NF1-OPG clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In children with brain tumors impacting their vision, physicians have difficulty determining when the treatment is working. We will improve upon the very basic and often inaccurate human measurements of tumor size by developing quantitative imaging tools to make accurate and automated measures of tumor volume and shape.

"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9926827,F30CA206291,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodal data', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,0.0468110667434005
"Rad-path-omic tools for rectal cancer treatment evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY: Of the estimated 43,030 patients who will be newly diagnosed with rectal cancer in 2018, a majority will receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NAC) to reduce tumor burden. All patients ultimately undergo an aggressive excision of the rectum, of which 25% exhibit complete pathologic response (pCR, i.e. disease- free after NAC) on the post-surgical specimen. These patients have therefore been subjected to an unnecessary, morbid procedure resulting in quality of life issues, in the absence of any definitive, non-invasive biomarkers for NAC response in vivo. While multi-parametric MRI is utilized to pre-operatively assess tumor response and regression to NAC, expert interpretation is confounded and variable due to overlapping appearance of benign treatment effects (e.g. fibrosis, ulceration) and residual tumor.  Recently, more quantitative characterization of lesions has been enabled via radiomics, involving high- throughput, computerized extraction of textural or kinetic attributes from imaging. Radiomic maps of the tumor environment can depict presence of different tissue types based on their structural and functional characteristics, visualized as regions of “low” and ‘high” feature expression. In fact, the post-NAC tumor environment on the excised rectal tissue specimen has been shown to reflect a variety and organization in different pathologic tissue types, also linked to patient prognosis and outcome. However, existing radiomic approaches only attempt to characterize the overall heterogeneity in a tissue region, as they lack “ground truth” to quantify tissue types and their organization on post-NAC MRI. A more comprehensive and accurate predictor for pCR based off multi- parametric MRI could thus be constructed by (a) quantifying the density and arrangement of structural and functional attributes on post-NAC rectal MRIs, and (b) optimizing radiomic descriptors against pathologically validated information of post-NAC tissue types on MRI, via spatial correlation with pathology.  In this proposal, I will develop novel radiomic tools in conjunction with spatially co-localized “ground truth” pathology to build a predictor for identifying rectal cancer patients exhibiting pCR via post-NAC MRI. Aim 1 will involve developing and evaluating a novel radiomic descriptor to quantify spatial organization of morphologic (via structural MRI) and physiologic (via contrast enhancement functional MRI) heterogeneity of the post-NAC lesion environment. Aim 2 will focus on optimizing this radiomic organization descriptor to capture distinctive tissue organization associated with pCR, via spatial mapping of post-surgical pathology information onto pre-operative MRI. My novel descriptor will be evaluated and validated via a machine learning predictor to identify patients exhibiting pCR using a discovery and a hold-out validation cohort, acquired from 2 different institutions; and compared with clinical markers of response. My project will build on promising preliminary results for my radiomic organization descriptor as well as a radiology-pathology co-registration framework, to result in a clinically reliable and impactful radiomics-based tool which could enable personalized management of rectal cancer patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This F31 proposal focuses on novel computational imaging tools for accurate identification and assessment of pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation via routine multi- parametric MRI. A comprehensive, quantitative assessment of post-chemoradiation tissue types and their tissue organization on imaging could enable (a) non-invasive identification of complete responders to avoid unneeded and highly morbid surgeries, and (b) more personalized management and follow-up for non-responders to NAC.",Rad-path-omic tools for rectal cancer treatment evaluation,9916627,F31CA216935,"['Appearance', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Colorectal Surgery', 'Colostomy Procedure', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In complete remission', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Morphology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Rectal Cancer', 'Rectum', 'Residual Tumors', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Sphincter', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Texture', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Markers', 'Ulcer', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'digital pathology', 'disease diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'in vivo', 'learning classifier', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'personalized management', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'rectal', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,0.0109575117617473
"Super-multiplexed fluorescence nanoscopy for imaging-based proteomics PROJECT SUMMARY In situ immunofluorescence imaging is a powerful method to study the locations, expression levels and structures of proteins in cells and tissues. In particular, multiplexed imaging reveals the interaction networks of proteins, which allows us to understand the underlying mechanisms of many diseases. However, it has been challenging to perform multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging due to its extremely time-consuming process, high cost and lack of signal amplification. The limited spatial resolution achievable with confocal microscopy often fails to reveal complex spatial organization and to determine localizations of proteins. Here we propose super-multiplexed immunofluorescence nanoscopy that is capable of imaging more than twenty different proteins in 24 hours with nanoscale resolution. We will employ DNA-barcoded secondary nanobodies that are monovalent, open-source and designed for quantitative labeling. Repeated introduction and washing of fluorescent DNA imagers will generate highly multiplexed images. Moreover, we will develop unprecedentedly fast stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy that employs a parallelized line array of doughnut beams. It will feature a large imaging area and excellent optical sectioning capability. Photon reassignment, hyperspectral imaging and deep-learning will further facilitate rapid super-resolution-based protein profiling. Our new biochemical and optical tools will play crucial roles in diverse biomedical areas including brain proteomics and cancer profiling.

"Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection PROJECT SUMMARY. Aortic dissections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young and old individuals alike. Whereas type A (ascending aorta) dissections are treated aggressively via surgery, type B (descending thoracic aorta) dissections are often monitored for long periods to determine the best treatment. These lesions can cease to propagate (i.e., stabilize or heal) or they can propagate further and either turn inward and connect again with the true lumen to form a re-entry tear or turn outward and result in rupture in the case of an compromised adventitia. Notwithstanding the importance of these later events, there is a pressing need to understand better the early processes that initiate the dissection and drive its initial propagation as well as to determine whether the presence of intramural thrombus is protective or not against early or continued propagation. Over the past 5 years our collaborative team has developed numerous new multimodality imaging techniques, biomechanical testing methods, and computational modeling approaches across multiple scales that uniquely positions us to understand better the process of early aortic dissection and the possible roles played by early intramural thrombus development. In this project, we propose to use nine complementary mouse models to gain broad understanding of the bio-chemo-mechanical processes that lead to aortic dissection and to introduce a new machine learning based multifidelity modeling approach to develop predictive probabilistic multiscale models of dissection. These models will be informed, trained, and validated via data obtained from a combination of unique in vitro biomechanical phenotyping experiments (wherein we can, for the first time, quantify the initial delamination process under well-controlled conditions and regional material properties thereafter) and novel multimodality imaging of delamination / dissection both in vitro and in vivo. We will consider, for example, the roles of different elastic lamellar geometries; we will assess separate roles of focal proteolytic activation and pooling of highly negatively charged mucoid material, which can degrade or swell the wall respectively; and we will model and assess the effects of early thrombus deposition within a false lumen. We submit that our new probabilistic paradigm, based on statistical autoregressive schemes and enabled by machine learning tools, could be transformative and lead to a paradigm shift in disease prediction where historical data, animal experiments, and limited clinical input (e.g., multiomics) can be used synergistically for robust prognosis and thus interventional planning. Our work is also expected to lead naturally to an eventual better understanding of the chronic processes associated with dissection via predictive models that are aided by the expected “revolution of resolution” in diagnostic imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mounting evidence reveals that thoracic aortic dissections – which afflict young and old individuals alike – are responsible for even greater disability and death than long thought. We will use a unique combination of multiple mouse models, advanced medical imaging, and novel computational models to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a dissection and reasons for the extreme biological variability that characterizes these lethal lesions.",Multimodality imaging-driven multifidelity modeling of aortic dissection,9981804,U01HL142518,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Rupture', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dilatation - action', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Thoracic aorta', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tunica Adventitia', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'Video Microscopy', 'Work', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'digital imaging', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'healing', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intracranial artery', 'microSPECT', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mucoid', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multiple omics', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,601275,0.013735169229932792
"Next-Generation Ultrasound Localization Microscopy Project Summary/Abstract Abnormal alterations of tissue microcirculation are often associated with early stage of tissue pathology. Detection and characterization of these early microvascular abnormalities can greatly benefit clinical diagnosis and treatment monitoring as well as facilitating the creation of new therapies to counter disease development. For decades, there has been a longstanding quest for the development of a clinical imaging modality that can noninvasively and directly image such tissue microvascular variations. To date, however, such an imaging method remains elusive due to the fundamental compromise between imaging spatial resolution and depth penetration. Therefore, the long-term objective of this project is to fulfill this unmet clinical need by developing the next-generation ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM), which is an ultrasound-based imaging technique that can directly assess structural and functional tissue microvasculature in vivo in humans at a clinically relevant depth. Different from other imaging modalities, ULM is not limited by the resolution-penetration compromise: ULM can noninvasively image capillary-scale microvessels at several centimeters depth and quantitatively measure their blood flow speed (as low as 1 mm/s). Such combination of deep imaging penetration and exquisite spatial resolution and the unique functionality of measuring small vessel blood flow speed make ULM a promising technique for many clinical applications including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. At present, however, ULM is not ready for clinical use due to several key technical limitations: 1) ULM data acquisition is very slow (tens of seconds with breath holding); 2) ULM post-processing is very expensive computationally (several hours to generate a single 2D ULM image); 3) ULM is difficult to be extended to 3D imaging (which is important for comprehensive evaluation of tissue microvasculature such as in cancer applications). These limitations largely forbids ULM from being effectively used in the clinic to provide useful microvascular biomarkers. In this proposal, we will concentrate on addressing these technical barriers and transform ULM to a truly useful clinical imaging tool. Our approach synergistically combines deep learning (DL), parallel computing, and ultrafast 3D ultrasound imaging to fundamentally shorten ULM data acquisition time, substantially accelerate ULM post-processing, and enhance ULM to 3D imaging. Our first aim will develop and validate DL-based ULM data processing algorithms that would enable real-time 4D morphometric ULM and fast 3D quantitative ULM. Our method uniquely collects real labeled optical imaging data on a chicken embryo microvessel model for DL training. Our second aim will focus on realizing 3D-ULM on a 2D row-column-addressing transducer with ultrafast 3D plane wave imaging. We will develop a DL-based beamforming technique to enable high-fidelity 3D microbubble imaging for robust 3D-ULM. Our final aim will focus on validating the in vivo performance of the newly developed 3D-ULM imaging techniques on a mouse tumor model. We will be collaborating with world-renowned experts in deep learning, optical imaging, and comparative medicine at the University of Illinois to accomplish these aims of the proposal. Project Narrative Imaging-based detection and characterization of abnormal tissue microvascular variations is clinically significant for diagnosis, treatment evaluation, and therapy development in many pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. At present, there is no viable noninvasive imaging tool that can fulfill this important clinical need. To fill this gap, we propose to develop a new ultrasound-based super-resolution microvessel imaging technique that can directly and quantitatively assess the structure and the function of tissue microcirculation in vivo in humans.",Next-Generation Ultrasound Localization Microscopy,10039725,R21EB030072,"['3-Dimensional', '3D ultrasound', '4T1', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chickens', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incentives', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbubbles', 'Microcirculation', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nutrient', 'Organ', 'Oxygen', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Transportation', 'Ultrasonic Transducer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'microscopic imaging', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optical imaging', 'parallel computer', 'performance tests', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'real-time images', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'two photon microscopy']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,565346,0.05557739636520697
"Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an invaluable tool for studying the early development of the brain and can resolve diagnostic ambiguities that may remain after routine ultrasound exams. Unfortunately, high levels of fetal and maternal motion (1) limit fetal MRI to rapid two-dimensional (2D) sequences and frequently introduce dramatic artifacts such as (2) image misorientation relative to the standard sagittal, coronal, axial planes needed for clinical assessment and (3) partial to complete signal loss. These factors lead to the inefficient practice of repeating ~30 s stack-of-slices acquisitions until motion-free images have been obtained. Throughout the session, technologists manually adjust the orientation of scans in response to motion, and about 38% of datasets are typically discarded. Thus, subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of MRI for answering clinical and investigational questions in the fetus. The overarching goal of this project is to overcome the challenges posed by motion by exploiting innovations in deep learning, which have enabled image-analysis algorithms with unprecedented speed and reliability. We propose to integrate these into the MRI acquisition pipeline to unlock the potential of fetal MRI. We will develop practical pulse-sequence technology for automated and dynamically motion-corrected fetal neuroimaging without the need for external hardware or calibration. We hypothesize that this will radically improve the quality and success rates of clinical and research studies, while dramatically reducing patient discomfort and cost. We propose as Aim 1 to eradicate (2) the vulnerability of acquisitions to image-brain misorientation with rapid, automated prescription of standard anatomical planes. In Aim 2, we propose to address (3) motion during the scan with real-time correction of fetal-head motion. An anatomical stack-of-slices acquisition will be interleaved with volumetric navigators. These will be used to measure motion as it happens in the scanner and to adaptively update the slice tilt/position. We propose as Aim 3 to develop a 3D radial sequence and estimate motion between subsets of radial spokes for real-time self-navigation. Adaptively updating the orientation of spokes and selectively re-acquiring corrupted subsets at the end of the scan will enable 3D imaging of the fetal brain (1). Since the applicant has a physics background, the proposed training program at MIT and HMS will focus on deep learning and fetal development/neuroscience during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed for transitioning to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant’s goal is to become a fetal image acquisition and analysis scientist acting as bridge between deep learning, MRI and clinical fetal-imaging applications to shift the boundaries of what is currently possible with state-of-the-art technology. Fulfilling the research aims will promote this, as it will result in a practical framework for automation and motion correction, applicable to a wide variety of fetal neuroimaging sequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging, as it frequently produces images with dramatic artifacts. The goal of this project is to exploit innovations in deep learning and integrate them into the acquisition pipeline to overcome the challenges posed by motion in fetal neuroimaging studies.

"Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction Nuclear medicine imaging in children has been shown to have significant clinical value across all organ systems. In providing this significant benefit it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that of adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. The governing principle of this project will be to minimize radiation dose while methodically ensuring that lesion detection performance is fully preserved. This will be accomplished by using validations based on both numerical and physician observers measuring performance in tasks that emulate those performed clinically. We will employ two approaches in tandem to enable lowering dose while maintaining performance. First, we will use advanced image reconstruction and processing techniques. Corrections for various forms of image quality degradation will be incorporated in the reconstruction, and deep learning (DL) will be used for post-reconstruction denoising. Second, we will develop methods to correct for both body and respiratory motion, which degrade diagnostic accuracy. Correcting for body and respiratory motion will allow dose to be reduced without loss of image quality and will also offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to minimize motion when imaging children. For this investigation we have selected 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal imaging as a testbed to demonstrate our approaches. Damage to the renal cortex resulting from infection of the kidneys is a critical issue in children, including newborns and toddlers. DMSA SPECT is the “gold-standard” in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal scarring post- infection. The concepts we will demonstrate for reduction of radiation dose and correction of motion with DMSA will be translatable to other SPECT (and PET) studies in pediatric imaging and beyond.  Our Specific Aims are: 1. Establish infrastructure for investigating and evaluating advanced reconstruction and motion correction; 2. Determine the extent of radiation dose reduction to pediatric patients through improved reconstruction and DL denoising while maintaining optimal full-dose lesion detection accuracy; 3. Develop data-driven and depth-sensing camera methods for body and respiratory motion estimation and correction; and 4. Conduct numerical and physician observer studies to validate the level of dose reduction enabled by DL denoising and motion correction. Narrative  In nuclear medicine imaging, it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that in adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. Correcting for body and respiratory motion occurring during imaging will improve the quality of the formed three-dimensional images of the patient by reducing blurring and image artifacts and offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to reduce motion when imaging children, which can bear health risks of its own. We propose an advanced reconstruction methodology which would enable reduction in the amount of activity administered and compensate for patient motion during imaging.",Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction,9914572,R01EB029315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DMSA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Freedom', 'Gaussian model', 'General Anesthesia', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Newborn Infant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Pyelonephritis', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Study', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toddler', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney infection', 'molecular imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'renal scarring', 'respiratory', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,773763,-0.0027744161426857305
"High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is in response to PA 18-484. In the BRAIN 2025 Report, PET (positron emission tomography) is identified as “the best means to translate studies of neurotransmitters, receptors, and neuromodulators to humans.” However dynamic assessment of receptor occupancy and metabolism is hindered by the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the most modern of clinically available PET scanners. To address this challenge, we propose a next generation PET detector with a highly innovative design: a detector module with a layered scintillator structure and a side readout configuration. The crystal slabs in the module are stacked along the depth direction and are optically separated by reflective films. The scintillation light created in each layer is measured by photodetectors located on the four sides of the crystal. Compared with traditional PET detectors, which contain pixelated crystal arrays, the new design has the following advantages: (1) The layered structure provides depth of interaction (DOI) information such that a smaller diameter detector ring can be used without increasing parallax error, increasing sensitivity while lowering costs. (2) The four-sided readout method improves the energy resolution of the system with increased scintillation light collection efficiency by reducing light loss due to total internal reflection. (3) Sub millimeter spatial resolution is achievable without using very small pitch crystal arrays, since the interaction location in each crystal layer is determined via machine learning- based decoding of the light distribution collected on the four crystal sides. Therefore the production cost of the crystals is reduced. (4) Since the interaction location and energy resolution for each layer are determined independently, the system sensitivity can be increased by stacking more layers in the module without affecting the spatial and energy resolution of the system. (5) For side readout setup, a larger ratio of cross-sectional area to length requires fewer photodetectors to cover all four sides of the module; this reduces photodetector cost. The first four points above have been demonstrated in preliminary studies using a small, prototype module. We propose to build a large scale detector module with this new design to verify the fifth advantage, and to study the effect of detector size on the first four. The outcome of this proposal will be two DOI enabled detector modules with excellent spatial resolution (~1 mm) and energy resolution (~10%), as well as good timing resolution (~400 ps), and DOI resolution (~ 3 mm) and high system sensitivity. A full characterization study for the two modules and imaging studies for both the Derenzo and Hoffman brain phantoms will address the current limitations of human brain PET scanners, and will serve as the foundation for a new dynamic PET scanner for neuroimaging. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a novel design for detector modules used in brain-dedicated PET system with good spatial resolution, energy resolution, timing resolution, and DOI resolution, as well as high sensitivity. If successful, the study will pave the way for building a novel PET system for greatly improved dynamic PET imaging of the human brain.",High performance PET Detector Module for Human Brain Imaging,10017238,R01EB028337,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Crystallization', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Gamma Rays', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portugal', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rod', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain size', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response']",NIBIB,"CANON MEDICAL RESEARCH USA, INC.",R01,2020,243919,0.020991638613179125
"Hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT: A new paradigm for image guidance in liver SBRT ABSTRACT This proposal aims to establish a hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for precision image guidance in radiation therapy of liver cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) improves the treatment outcome over conventional fractionated radiotherapy by delivering high fractional dose in few fractions. However, SBRT of liver cancer still has high local failure rate up to 20-30% at 2-3 years and high overall grade>=3 toxicity rate up to 30% with patient deaths from the treatment. Previous studies demonstrated a strong correlation between the treatment outcome and the tumor localization accuracy of the image guidance technique used. Currently, cone beam CT (CBCT) is the most widely used imaging technique for liver SBRT. However, CBCT has extremely limited soft tissue contrast with no visualization of most liver tumors. As a result, its localization error is frequently over 6mm, and the dose coverage of tumor volume can fall below 90%, which is far from enough for tumor control. Drastically reducing localization errors is imperative to improve the outcome of liver SBRT. Combined MRI-Radiotherapy machines could provide MRI contrast for liver tumor localization. However, such machines are rare and expensive for most clinics. As such, an alternative solution is urgently required to meet the ubiquitous need of all radiation oncology departments: a solution in the form of a novel low-cost imaging system with MRI equivalent contrast. Since CBCT is readily available on most radiotherapy machines, creating CBCT-based imaging systems would be the most effective strategy. Our recent publication demonstrated the feasibility of such strategy. (Harris, Med Phys 2018) Our long-term goal is to establish the next generation of CBCT systems with virtual multi-modality imaging capabilities for high precision tumor localization and adaptive therapy in radiation therapy. In this application, our overall objective is to establish a novel system to generate hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT from CBCT, with virtual-MRI inside the liver for target localization and augmented CBCT outside the liver for healthy tissue verification. The specific aims are: (1). Establish a 3D hybrid virtual- MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in breath-hold liver SBRT without respiratory motion. (2). Establish a 4D hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system for image guidance in free-breathing liver SBRT with respiratory motion. (3). Optimize and clinically evaluate the systems through simulation studies and a prospective clinical trial. Our expected deliverables through the academic-industrial partnership are novel hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT systems ready to be integrated to all radiotherapy machines with only CBCT systems. This new imaging capability will have significant clinical impact because it will create a paradigm shift in image-guided radiation therapy by revolutionizing the widely used CBCT systems to enable a new era of low-cost high-precision virtual multi- modality guided radiotherapy. This precision guidance can lead to breakthrough in escalating the tumor control and minimizing the toxicities of liver SBRT as well as treatments of other sites with tumors in the soft tissue. Project Narrative The hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system will be a low-cost imaging system with superb soft tissue contrast to provide precise image guidance for liver SBRT, which paves the road to further margin reduction and dose escalation. As a result, this novel system has a great potential to enhance the tumor local control and reduce the normal tissue toxicities for all patients under liver SBRT treatments. Finally yet importantly, the hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT system can also be potentially applicable for improving the image guidance precision of radiation therapy treatments of other clinical sites with tumors in the soft tissue, such as breast and prostate cancers.",Hybrid virtual-MRI/CBCT: A new paradigm for image guidance in liver SBRT,10021659,R01EB028324,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Breathing', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Fractionated radiotherapy', 'Goals', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Residual state', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Volume', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'falls', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recursive neural network', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,496097,0.02137292409508279
"Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies Project Abstract Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) continues to play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease (CAD). While conventional SPECT scanners using parallel-hole collimators are still the foundation of cardiac SPECT, recently our field observed an exciting growth of new developments of dedicated cardiac scanners. Such dedicated scanners, such as the GE Alcyone 530/570c systems and the D-SPECT systems both with CZT detectors, typically have multiple detectors collecting photons emitted from the heart simultaneously, leading to dramatically improved sensitivity (2-5 X). In addition, the GE systems use pinhole collimators and can achieve much higher resolution. These dedicated scanners opened doors to new applications with significant clinical impact, including ultra-low-dose imaging, absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), high resolution molecular imaging, multi-isotope imaging, motion correction, and many more. Most of these new applications are uniquely achievable only using dedicated scanners. While the dedicated cardiac SPECT systems can improve clinical practice and lead to numerous new clinical applications, such systems are far from being optimized to fully realize their great potentials. In this grant, we propose to systematically develop and optimize innovative imaging technologies for the GE 530/570c systems to further improve its clinical efficacy in a variety of significant ways. In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize methods for static cardiac SPECT imaging. We will develop various deep learning methods and investigate approaches to increase angular sampling to reduce noise, and improve resolution and quantitative accuracy. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate methods for dynamic SPECT imaging, particularly involving direct parametric image reconstruction. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate methods for dual-isotope SPECT. Monte Carso simulation and deep learning based methods will be developed for tracers with different spatial distributions and fast kinetics. In all three aims, large animal studies and human subject data will be used for optimization and validation. Narrative The success of imaging technology developments proposed in this grant will substantially improve the image quality, reduce patient dose, expand the applications of cardiac SPECT from mainly static imaging to dynamic imaging, and establish multi-isotope clinical imaging.",Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies,10064473,R01HL154345,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collimator', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DCNU', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infarction', 'Isotopes', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Molecular Target', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myopathy', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Tail', 'Toxic effect', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Validation', 'animal data', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical application', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'new growth', 'parametric imaging', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'technology development']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,806926,-0.018661617608613745
"Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients Project Summary  Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and aggressive form of brain cancer affecting up to 20,000 new patients in the US every year. Standard of care therapies include stereotactic surgical resection, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. After initial treatment, patient monitoring is guided by standard MR imaging performed at routine intervals. Despite these rigorous therapies, current median survival is only 15 months. Imaging is a central part of brain tumor management, but MRI findings in brain tumor patients can be challenging to interpret and is further confounded by interpretation variability. Accurate interpretation of imaging is particularly important during the post-treatment phase of patient care as it can help clinicians proactively manage disease through early, precise characterization of true tumor recurrence. Disease-specific structured reporting systems attempt to reduce variability in imaging results by implementing well-defined imaging criteria and standardized language. The Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS), developed at Emory University, is one such framework streamlined for clinical workflows and includes quantitative criteria for more objective evaluation of follow-up imaging. While BT-RADS has had success with clinical adoptability, it still faces hurdles reducing interobserver variability and improving objective classification of disease state.  This proposed study addresses an unmet need for unbiased, quantitative metrics for robust, objective interpretation of follow-up imaging for GBM patients. Where previous evaluative methods used two-dimensional, representative MRI slices for evaluating the extent of tumor, we propose to develop a deep learning segmentation tool, accurately calculating volumes of tumor after surgical resection, and trained from our expansive database of patient data with contours manually drawn by radiation oncologists. Further, we propose to develop computationally advanced software for predicting disease progression building upon the clinically developed BT- RADS criteria. Such tools would assist physicians in caring for brain tumor patients through post-treatment surveillance and guide future clinical decision making. In addition, we believe these quantitative metrics would have unbounded potential in clinical trial settings where it may be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutics for GBM. Therefore, these assistive tools will be tested on clinical trial data to determine if they are superior to conventional measurements alone.  A fundamental goal of this proposal is ensuring the quantitative tools we develop are applicable for clinicians in their daily lives. Therefore, an effort will be made to collaborate extensively with clinicians to house the algorithms in sleek, intuitive software for physicians to utilize. Through the multidisciplinary environment, high performance computing, and clinical resources we have available, we believe this proposal will be successful in developing clinically assistive tools for unbiased, objective monitoring of GBM patients in clinical settings and evaluation of novel therapies in research settings. Project Narrative  Follow-up imaging for glioblastoma patients is challenging to interpret due to subjectivity in evaluating disease state and overlap between treatment effects and tumor progression. More objective follow-up criteria are vital for sensitive and accurate monitoring of glioblastoma patients after initial treatment to ensure proactive management of disease and accurate characterization of tumor recurrence. This research proposal will develop user-friendly quantitative software for lesion segmentation and disease-state assessment, providing unbiased metrics for post-treatment patient monitoring and guidance of management decisions in clinical and research settings.",Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients,9911574,F31CA247564,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Information Systems', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'aggressive therapy', 'automated image analysis', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'quantitative imaging', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,0.04051316433097692
"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary Each major human disease is associated with a specific range of morphological changes to cells and tissues in the micron scale. Normal and abnormal structure was discovered and is still characterized using histology - a microscopic technique that depends on physical tissue slices. Presently, histology’s use in systems biology is limited by its largely descriptive and two-dimensional nature. Making histology quantitative and three-dimensional would be potentially transformational for research and diagnostics, but has been impractical. Accordingly, we have now created a 3D form of histology by customizing X-ray microtomography (micro-CT) of fixed and stained, millimeter-scale, whole organisms and tissue samples. We used fixed and metal-stained, whole zebrafish because they contain a full range of tissues within the size range currently studied histologically. The result is the first practical way to create virtual histology-like “sections” in any plane. Three-dimensional, complete histological phenotyping has potential use in genetic and chemical screens, and in clinical and toxicological tissue diagnostics. Here, we propose the next steps needed to enable high-throughput, quantitative, 3D histological phenotyping of whole, millimeter-scale animals. The proposed work applies the principles of chemistry, physics, and computer science to improve image resolution, throughput, and analytics, organized into three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will build on our developments in this project and further improve imaging volume and resolution by upgrading imaging array, optics, and sub-pixel shifting, and to throughput by changes in sample embedding, loading geometry and mechanics, helical CT scanning, scintillator material, and to data sharing by improvements to the ViewTool infrastructure and user interface. Specific Aim 2 will yield reference images to define the range of normal phenotypic variation and to obtain samples related to a range of potential applications. Specific Aim 3 will apply the power of machine learning to segmentation, annotation, and analytics. Together, this work will establish a practical foundation for large-scale genetic and chemical screens involving mm-scale, whole organisms based on 3-dimensional, quantitative, histological phenotyping. The instrumentation and analytics will be state-of-the-art in its combination of resolution, field-of-view, pancellularity, image quality, analytical potential, throughput, sample stability, and reproducibility and largely usable with both tube and synchrotron X-ray sources. The voxel resolution will be at least 0.5 μm across fields-of-view of up to 1 cm. Representation of every cell type make the images suitable for cross-referencing across imaging modalities. Potential applications will be explored, “wild-type” will begin to be defined, and training sets for automated segmentation generated. The potential impact will encompass the missions of most NIH Institutes and Centers. The whole-animal genetic and chemical screens enabled are expected to impact drug development, diagnostics, and our basic understanding of how genes and environment define phenotype. Project Narrative Our group has established the only three-dimensional form of histology that is suitable for histopathology and quantitative tissue phenotyping, tissue X-ray microtomography (micro-CT). We outline here a plan to establish mechanisms for increasing resolution and field-of-view, to add sample multiplexing, to simply sample preparation, and to explore machine learning mechanisms for defining normal and abnormal structure towards whole-organism complete tissue phenotyping. The resulting tools will allow the community to comprehensively and computationally determine the roles of genes and environment in defining phenotype, which has implications in drug development, biomedical research, and medicine.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),9991958,R24OD018559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Genetics', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cesium', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Iodides', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve', 'Normal Range', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Preparation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Spiral Computed Tomography', 'Stains', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Zebrafish', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bone', 'cell type', 'clinical toxicology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data dissemination', 'data sharing', 'detector', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'feature detection', 'histological studies', 'human disease', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'microCT', 'millimeter', 'mutant', 'programs', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'virtual']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2020,655482,0.003423337165132704
"Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new “NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis”(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project. Project narrative This proposal aims to use advanced pattern analysis and machine learning methods to structural MRI data, in order to elucidate patterns of neuroanatomical change in psychosis, and use those to derive diagnostic and predictive indices on an individual patient basis. Data from over 3,000 individuals across 3 continents will be pooled together and harmonized, thereby allowing us to analyze the heterogeneity of neuroanatomy of psychosis, to relate it to clinical measures, and to construct predictors of clinical outcome in first episode patients.",Mapping Heterogeneity of Neuroanatomical Imaging Signatures of Psychosis via Pattern Analysis,9942277,R01MH112070,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'first episode psychosis', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'supervised learning', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,658144,0.005521664212073711
"Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is an enormous clinical problem and worldwide cause of disability. Development of new therapies for OA is hampered by a lack of sensitive imaging tests that respond to changes in disease status. Recently FDA and CE approved clinical knee 7T MRI has the potential to add sensitivity and specificity to advanced MRI biomarkers of OA progression. This project will compare changes seen at 3T and 7T across two different vendors systems and assess the potential for 7T MRI to improve our ability to study and develop new disease- modifying therapies. This study will enhance future studies and clinical exams at 7T and can be used to improve routine 3T MRI though machine learning reconstruction and enhanced understanding of OA disease mechanisms. Understanding the relative strengths of 3T and 7T MRI in this important clinical application is critical to developing new disease-modifying treatments for patients with OA. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide.

This technology is back compatible with archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) and has been used in peer-reviewed work to simultaneously visualize and quantify 36 proteins in retrospective human tissue cohorts. In line with the stated goals of the HuBMAP consortium to develop both “High-sensitivity, high-resolution imaging techniques that can rapidly provide spectral data over large areas of tissue” and “Quantitative imaging analysis tools, including automated 3D image segmentation, feature extraction, and image annotation,” the work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease. To achieve this, we will validate 100 FFPE antibodies and optimize ready-to-use multiplexed staining panels in lyophilized format that will permit storage for at least two years. Protocols and reagents for multiplexed signal amplification of protein and mRNA targets will be further refined, while next generation instrumentation will increase sample throughput to permit full tissue section imaging of up to 40 proteins in 1 hour. Standardized reagents and more robust instrumentation will be accompanied by an automated computational pipeline that utilizes a standard set of segmentation markers and machine learning to accurately identify nuclei and cell borders in any non-neural human tissue. This data will be used to cluster single cell events into functionally distinct populations according to morphology, protein expression, and histological distribution. The reagents and computational pipeline proposed here synergize with existing HuBMAP-funded platforms and could be readily generalized to virtually any high dimensional imaging modality. Thus, this work will not only provide a practical, back compatible imaging platform for high throughput multiplexed imaging, but will also accelerate development of other complimentary imaging technologies as well. Project Narrative Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) is a new technology for visualizing dozens of proteins in standard clinical tissue biopsies at high resolution. The work outlined here will create a standardized, high throughput, and user-friendly workflow for using MIBI-TOF in basic and translational research to gain insight into how single cell phenotype and tissue structure are functionally-linked in health and disease.","A robust platform for multiplexed, subcellular proteomic imaging in human tissue",10231018,UH3CA246633,"['Allergic', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freeze Drying', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Granuloma', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human BioMolecular Atlas Program', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Ions', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'Morphology', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Readiness', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'graphical user interface', 'high dimensionality', 'high resolution imaging', 'human imaging', 'human tissue', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'ion source', 'machine learning method', 'multiplexed imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'protein expression', 'quantitative imaging', 'reagent standardization', 'technology validation', 'tool', 'tumor microenvironment', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,UH3,2020,700000,-0.0033330377582515805
"Brain Cancer Radio-Pathomics for Predicting Heterogeneous Cytology Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. ! Project Narrative This project will provide a detailed understanding of how brain tumors at the cellular level appear on macroscopic imaging by examining whole brain human samples and clinical MRI scans. We will develop computational algorithms trained with histology to recognize patterns in MRI scans (i.e. radiopathomics), which will negate the need for tissue.

"Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients ABSTRACT The prevalence of obesity in the United States has risen to record levels over the past 40 years, putting strain on the healthcare system and creating difficult challenges for medical imaging. We propose to overcome the challenges that obesity poses to ultrasound imaging by (1) developing novel image-quality improvement techniques, and (2) implementing them on pulse-echo ultrasound imaging systems to yield high-quality images of the liver. Ultrasound imaging is uniquely affected by the presence of additional connective tissue and thick subcutaneous fat layers in overweight and obese patients; these additional subcutaneous layers greatly exacerbate reverberation and phase-aberration of the acoustic wave, leading to high levels of clutter, degraded resolution, and overall poor-quality ultrasound images. Our proposed methods will determine the local speed-of-sound in abdominal tissue layers and use this information to accomplish distributed phase-aberration correction. We also apply machine learning techniques to model and suppress the effects of reverberation clutter and speckle noise. The combination of these techniques is expected to achieve significant improvements in liver image quality. These image-quality improvement methods will be implemented on a real-time ultrasound scanner and will be evaluated in clinical imaging tasks of overweight and obese patients undergoing ultrasound surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Successful development of the proposed technology will not only enable high-quality ultrasound imaging of the liver in otherwise difficult-to-image overweight and obese patients, but also facilitate improved image quality across nearly all ultrasound imaging applications, for all populations. NARRATIVE This proposal aims to develop and test several new techniques to overcome the current limitations of ultrasound to make high-quality images in overweight and obese individuals. These novel ultrasound techniques will be initially applied to improve liver imaging in overweight and obese patients in a pilot study, though the benefits of this new high-quality imaging technology will extend to all other areas of clinical ultrasound imaging.",Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients,9885175,R01EB027100,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Weight', 'clinical imaging', 'elastography', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'liver imaging', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'simulation', 'sound', 'subcutaneous']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,590183,0.030217281937590823
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"INTEGRATING OMICS AND QUANTITATIVE IMAGING DATA IN CO-CLINICAL TRIALS TO PREDICT TREATMENT RESPONSE IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER Project Summary Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very challenging disease because it is biologically aggressive, there are no targeted therapies, and, consequently, patients have poor prognosis. Although immunotherapy is promising for treating many cancers, TNBC lacks specific molecular targets, no predictive biomarkers to chemotherapy response have yet been identified, and treatment response is difficult to evaluate using current biomarker assessments. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC offer the exciting opportunity of evaluating this disease in terms of molecular features (e.g., genomic copy number, whole exome sequence, and mRNA expression) to identify candidate “omic” biomarkers that best predict the ultimate response to treatment and could provide surrogate endpoints to validate novel imaging biomarkers in co-clinical trial human trails. Moreover, emerging quantitative MRI methods, such as dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI), contain rich physiological signals in the images for predicting treatment response, but it is challenging to integrate both animal and human data to reliably predict the treatment response. A paradigm of “co-clinical trials” is emerging in which new treatments are evaluated in animals, and the results guide treatments in clinical trials, but there is a paucity of informatics tools and resources to enable analyses in such animal-to-human work. We believe that an informatics-based methodology that integrates molecular `omics' and imaging data will propel advances in TNBC by enabling development of machine learning models to predict the response to therapies. In order to develop research resources that will encourage consensus on how quantitative imaging methods are optimized to improve the quality of imaging results for co-clinical trials, we will leverage an ongoing co-clinical trial we are undertaking to pursue the following specific aims: (1) Identify molecular biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDX); (2) Identify quantitative MRI biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts; and (3) Evaluate our informatics tools in a prospective co-clinical trial. Our proposed research is significant and innovative because it leverages advances in basic cancer biology, state-of-the-art imaging technologies, and informatics methods to develop a resource to catalyze discovery in this important disease. Our PDX-based approach will provide the cancer community with a rational, iterative, combined pre-clinical and clinical methodology and supporting data resource for making progressively more refined and personalized therapeutic regimens for TNBC patients. Our methods and tools will likely also generalize to other cancers and could, therefore, substantially benefit the care of all cancer patients. Project Narrative Determining the optimal therapies for a specific triple negative breast cancer tumor is currently not possible, as the number of possible treatment combinations is too large to evaluate experimentally in clinical trials. Our proposed methods that leverage patient derived xenografts and machine learning analysis of integrated `omics and quantitative imaging data will provide the cancer community with a rational, iterative, combined pre-clinical and clinical trial approach and supporting data resource for making progressively more refined and personalized therapeutic regimens in these patients. Our methods and tools will likely also generalize to other cancers and could, therefore, substantially benefit the care of all cancer patients.",INTEGRATING OMICS AND QUANTITATIVE IMAGING DATA IN CO-CLINICAL TRIALS TO PREDICT TREATMENT RESPONSE IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER,10020941,U24CA226110,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carboplatin', 'Caring', 'Cellularity', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In complete remission', 'Informatics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mus', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Online Systems', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'animal data', 'arm', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'candidate identification', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'diffusion weighted', 'docetaxel', 'exome', 'high resolution imaging', 'human data', 'human model', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mRNA Expression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'online resource', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized therapeutic', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical trial', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'repaired', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U24,2020,632900,-0.04820540803617175
"Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer The goal of this research is to clinically translate software tools we developed through the Quantitative Imaging Network and validate their ability to assess the response of cancer in clinical trials. Current RECIST response criteria are inadequate to detect tumor changes in targeted molecular therapy and immunotherapies, two of the most promising avenues for drug discovery. We hypothesize that innovative volumetric and radiomics signatures of response and progression, identified using our quantitative CT imaging tools, can be integrated into clinical trial workflow to meet the urgent need for alternatives to RECIST criteria. Two large multi-site trials present a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in one disease treated with multiple therapeutic options driven by tissue biomarkers. S0819 is a completed Phase III trial with 1300+ patients and Lung- MAP (S1400) is an ongoing first-of-its-kind Phase II/III model projected to enroll up to 5,000 patients using a multi-drug, targeted screening approach to match patients with sub-studies testing investigational treatments based on their unique tumor profiles. Aim 1 tests whether change in tumor volume over time, measured by our advanced volumetric segmentation algorithms, outperforms unidimensional RECIST 1.1 response criteria. Aim 2 correlates genomic mutations identified in S0819 and Lung-MAP with radiomics signatures constructed by our machine learning models, with the goal of developing a non-invasive, easily repeatable virtual biopsy through CT imaging. Aim 3 validates the prediction of clinical outcomes using early biomarkers of response and progression based on quantitative CT-based radiomic features, hypothesized to outperform both RECIST and volumetrics alone across therapeutic options including chemotherapies, targeted molecular agents, and immune checkpoint blockade. Our work has substantial health significance because validation of volume and radiomic changes as early biomarkers of response or progression will guide clinical trials for drug discovery and help match patients to personalized treatment. Response criteria developed through this study will be widely applicable to clinical practice because CT is the most common cancer imaging modality and the quantitative image analysis tools can easily be incorporated into existing popular imaging platforms and clinical workflow, reducing the time required by radiologists. Data from this project, including anonymized imaging data (CT for all patients and PET for a large subset), clinical meta- data, and lesion mark-ups by independent radiologists, will be shared for use by other researchers through the TCGA Cancer Imaging Archive, continuing an extensive history of data sharing by this team. This work will improve drug discovery for promising new classes of therapies by creating innovative response criteria based on volumetric and radiomics signatures developed with prior support by the QIN and now validated in two large multi-site clinical trials studying multiple therapeutic options in the most important histologic types of lung cancer and most commonly used imaging modality, CT. Results are expected to be applied to other tumor types and help match patients to the treatment that works best for them.","Integrating Radiomics into S0819 and Lung-MAP, Biomarker Driven Clinical Trials for Lung Cancer",9947900,U01CA225431,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carboplatin', 'Cetuximab', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunotherapy', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paclitaxel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Cancer Imaging Archive', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'drug discovery', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'genomic signature', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'mutant', 'mutational status', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic value', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2020,609531,-0.04645130340442586
"Imaging Mass Spectrometry for metabolome mapping SUMMARY In response to NOT-GM-20-013, we are requesting a supplement to our R01 5R01GM120033-04 for an MALDI imaging source unit to be attached to an existing Q ExactiveMass Spectrometer (Ultra-High Mass Range Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™) for spatial mapping of metabolites in thin tissue sections. Within our R01 award, to analyze NMR metabolome data we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on recent developments in machine learning. We have coded these algorithms and tested their sensitivity and specificity on both synthesized and real data. We then applied these methods to human disease models and identified putative biomarkers. To validate these biomarkers, we have developed methods to analyze animal tissues and human brain organoids using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), which permits spatial localization of metabolites without labeling. This targeted IMS metabolic phenotyping approach complements our untargeted NMR methods: it allows us to determine whether the individual metabolites identified by NMR represent bona fide biomarkers and to develop metabolic hypotheses for their association with disease. We submit this request for imaging mass spectrometer hardware because a nearby IMS facility on which we have relied has closed and no other IMS facility exists in greater Houston area. Performing the IMS studies ourselves, with the help of collaborators, will accelerate our discovery about the role small molecules and metabolites play in health and disease. This instrument will help us better i) perform metabolome screens to identify the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on neural cell types in human brain organoid models; ii) perform high-throughput drug screening to stimulate neural stem cells to produce new neurons in the brain organoid models to regenerate damaged tissue; and iii) use our NMR algorithms to develop a protocol for quantitative imaging. None of these studies will be possible without the imaging mass spectrometer. Given our access to state-of-the-art equipment, data-collection expertise, and new analytical algorithms that are especially sensitive and specific to NMR spectral data, we are uniquely positioned to advance biomarker and diagnostics tools and screening methods for metabolites and synthetic small molecules. Using an imaging mass spectrometer to map metabolite distribution may help us discover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers not only for SARS-CoV-2, but for a broad spectrum of brain disorders that lead to neurodegeneration. Such broad usage of our platform would be transformative for neuroscientists, neurologists, and their patients. NARRATIVE The metabolome is a dynamic and sensitive biological system that reflects both innate processes and environmental influences, and can therefore tell us much about an organism's health and homeostasis. In our R01, we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms to analyze NMR metabolome data.

"8th International CEST workshop (CEST2020) Project Summary/Abstract The 8th International Workshop of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI in November 2020 (CEST2020) brings together an international community of experts in CEST imaging. CEST MRI has gained tremendous interest from the research community, and many leading institutions have joined forces to optimize CEST MRI and develop new applications in a host of diseases including acute stroke, epilepsy, and, most importantly, tumor imaging. Recently, machine learning and neuron networks have been explored for CEST imaging. The CEST 2020 forges research and learning opportunities for students and young researchers in a dedicated forum unmatched by other meetings. CEST 2020 is being organized by Phillip Zhe Sun, Ph.D. (Emory University), in conjunction with the CEST Workshop steering committee of well- established scholars in the CEST MRI field. It will run November 8-11, 2020, at the Emory Conference Center Hotel located on the Emory University campus in Atlanta, Georgia. The goal is to bring together researchers from varying backgrounds and clinicians from related disciplines and to provide a forum for communication among these multi-disciplinary groups. The workshop will feature a blend of plenary sessions, invited scientific presentations, manuscripts, poster presentations, and panel discussions. The meeting will provide all participants the opportunity to present and learn emerging applications of CEST imaging. Emory University researchers have contributed to the development of the CEST MRI field, from the theory, experimental optimization, and quantification. Members well established in the CEST MRI field including Dr. Peter van Zijl, Dr. Dean Sherry, Dr. John Gore, Dr. Marty Pagel, and Dr. Reddy Ravinder, will attend and present their work. This creates an outstanding intellectual enrichment opportunity not just for well-established investigators but also for students, postdocs and junior faculty as they enter into this exciting field of MRI research. The primary goal is to create opportunities and offer supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee's career to enhance their research potential and the likelihood of success. We will have two plenary sessions, two poster sessions, and two power pitch sessions, in which the goal is to share the state of the art CEST research and engage newcomers to the field. Also, we will select 3-4 oral presentations for each scientific session from submitted abstracts to promote the rising stars in the field and provide our feedback on their work, strength, and, most importantly, areas to improve.

"High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging The cornea is the primary focusing structure of our visual system. Infections and diseases in the tissue can impair vision and lead to blindness, even in eyes with intact neurosensory function. Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness in the world. Tissue evaluation is an important step for assessing the health of the donor cornea and its appropriateness for different types of placement, yet this process suffers from high subjectivity. High-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist in selection of the most appropriate tissue for transplant. Progress on this front would greatly serve public need, as the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide, with nearly 185,000 transplants annually. Thus, a more sensitive and quantitative method for objective evaluation of tissue at eye banks is needed. We have developed a 3D high-definition imaging instrument based on Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GDOCM). Our SBIR Phase I research successfully accomplished all Aims and demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative assessment of corneal tissue over a large field of view with GDOCM. Our Phase I results demonstrated that GDOCM has the following key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1) improved accuracy of tissue qualification with 4-10x increase in field of view that reduces sampling error – this will provides a truer assessment of the overall tissue characteristics; 2) ability to simultaneously measure corneal thickness, quantify endothelial cell density, and identify morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to complete corneal evaluation in a single instrument; 3) leveraging machine learning innovations to minimize variability induced by users – this will result in a more objective evaluation; 4) enhanced 3D cellular-level imaging of thin translucent endothelial cells – this will enable a detailed understanding of cell viability. The results of the proposed Phase studies II will demonstrate that GDOCM can provide high-definition, 3D visualization of corneal structures with immediate commercial application for qualification of donor tissue in eye banks, and with a path to in vivo clinical imaging of patients with corneal disease. Current corneal evaluation methods employed at eye banks have limited field of view and/or insufficient resolution, and their results suffer from high subjectivity. We propose to commercialize a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscope to enable non-invasive, high-definition, wide field of view imaging in 3D for eye banks.","High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging",10239347,R44EY028827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Blindness', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Density', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Viability Process', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Banks', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Innovation Corps', 'International', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient imaging', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rights', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Visual system structure', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical imaging', 'commercial application', 'density', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo regeneration', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurosensory', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'trend']",NEI,LIGHTOPTECH CORPORATION,R44,2020,178785,0.01583769098739917

"Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) using the radiolabeled tracer 2- deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has become a standard imaging tool for cancer patient management. The semi-quantitative parameter standardized uptake value (SUV) is routinely used in clinical for tumor uptake quantification, which is computed on the static PET image acquired at a certain time (typically 60 min) post tracer injection for a short interval (typically 5-15 min). However, the quantification accuracy of SUV from a single PET scan suffers from the variabilities of tracer plasma clearance and acquisition start time. The dual- time-point FDG PET imaging has been intensively investigated and used in both clinical and research studies, typically one scan at 60 min and the other at 120 min, showing the potential to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET by differentiating malignancy from inflammation and normal tissue. However, the current clinical dual-time-point FDG PET studies use the relative SUV change between two scans as the quantification index, which cannot eliminate the variations in tracer plasma clearance. Meanwhile, the dual-time-point protocol has not been optimized and standardized currently, leading to conflicting results. The fully-quantitative parameter, tracer net uptake rate constant Ki, is the most accurate parameter to quantify FDG PET, which is calculated using dynamic imaging with compartmental modeling. Ki is independent on the plasma clearance or acquisition start time. However, the long and complex acquisition protocol (typically at least 60 min), which requires dynamic scanning and sequential arterial blood sampling (or image-derived blood activity) used as input function from the time of injection, limits its application in clinical practice. Meanwhile, generation of the parametric Ki image, which can provide additional heterogeneity information for FDG PET, is challenging clinically using voxel-by-voxel compartmental modeling due to the computational cost and being sensitive to noise using non-linear least squares. The graphical Patlak plot, can be used for simplified Ki calculation and Ki image generation by voxel-by-voxel fitting. However, it still needs dynamic scanning starting from 15-30 min after injection and input function from the time of injection. The aims of this proposal are 1) to optimize the dual-time-point protocol for accurate Ki quantification using Patlak plot without the need for individual patient's input function, and 2) to generate high-quality low-noise dual-time-point Ki images using novel techniques based on deep learning. Upon the success of this project, our proposed approach can obtain reliable tumor Ki quantification and parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual- time-point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology. We expect the translation of this approach to clinical investigation to be fast, as this is a post-processing approach and is based on data already acquired using clinically used protocol without imposing additional burden to technologists. Project Narrative For FDG PET imaging, we propose to develop a novel and simple approach of quantifying tumor Ki and generating parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual-time- point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology.",Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans,9896329,R03EB027864,"['Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Inflammation', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Plasma', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiolabeled', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'parametric imaging', 'population based', 'research study', 'simulation', 'success', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,80375,0.017918923545915472
"MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CT is currently the gold standard in radiation therapy treatment planning. MRI provides a number of advantages over CT, including improved accuracy of target delineation, reduced radiation exposure, and simplified clinical workflow. There are two major technical hurdles that are impeding the clinical adoption of MRI-based radiation treatment planning: (1) geometric distortion, and (2) lack of electron density information. The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation treatment planning. We hypothesize that accurate patient geometry and electron density information can be derived from MRI if the appropriate MR image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis methods are applied. In Aim 1, we will improve the geometric accuracy of MRI by minimizing system-level and patient- specific distortions. To maintain sufficient system-level accuracy, we will perform comprehensive machine- specific calibrations and ongoing quality assurance procedures. To correct patient-induced distortions, we will develop novel computational tools to derive a detailed magnetic field distortion map based on physical principles, which is used to correct susceptibility-induced spatial distortions. In Aim 2, we will develop a unifying Bayesian method for quantitative electron density mapping, by combining the complementary intensity and geometry information. By utilizing multiple patient atlases and panoramic, multi-parametric MRI with differential contrast, we will apply machine learning techniques to encode the information given by intensity and geometry into two conditional probability density functions. These will be combined into one unifying posterior probability density function, which provides the optimal electron density on a continuous scale. In Aim 3, we will clinically evaluate the geometric and dosimetric accuracy of MRI for treatment planning in terms of 3 primary end points: (1) organ contours, (2) patient setup based on reference images, and (3) 3D dose distributions (both photon and proton), using CT as the ground truth. These evaluations will be conducted through patient studies at multiple disease sites, including brain, head and neck, and prostate. Success of the project will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. This will pave the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process. It will streamline the treatment workflow for the MRI-guided radiation delivery systems under active development. With minimal modification, the proposed techniques can be applied to MR-based PET attenuation correction in PET/MR imaging. More broadly, the unifying Bayesian formalism can be used to improve current imaging biomarkers by integrating a wide variety of disparate information including anatomical and functional imaging such as perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging. It will facilitate the incorporation of multimodality MRI into the entire process of cancer management: diagnosis, staging, radiation treatment planning, and treatment response assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this project is to develop novel image analysis and computational tools to enable MRI-based radiation therapy treatment planning. Success of the project will overcome the major technical hurdles in the use of MRI in radiation therapy and will afford distortion-free MRI with reliable, quantitative electron density information. It will pve the way for MRI-based radiation treatment planning, leading to an improved accuracy in the overall radiation therapy process.",MRI-Based Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning,9843490,R01CA193730,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'anatomic imaging', 'attenuation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'density', 'electron density', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'primary endpoint', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,354198,-0.0045466626033080415
"In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging ABSTRACT There is still great need in better characterizing new targeted therapies in vivo, especially prior to clinical translation. In this regard, preclinical molecular imaging is a central tool in the targeted drug development pipeline. However, there is still a lack of integrated imaging platforms that can enable longitudinal (multiple time points) and spatially-resolved monitoring of complex fingerprints including molecular, metabolic and functional signatures in the same tumor/subject. This new integrated multiplexing imaging platform will play a crucial role in the development of the next generation of targeted drugs and elucidating (multi-) drug resistance mechanisms. Recently, we have demonstrated the unique capabilities of optical imaging in quantifying receptor-target engagement in live subjects by leveraging fluorescence lifetime. This outstanding achievement was realized thanks to the combination of instrumental, algorithmic and biochemical innovations to enable, for the first time, whole-body time-resolved optical imaging based on structured light for 2D or 3D Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging in live subjects. Herein, we will further impact the field of optical preclinical imaging and drug delivery assessment by 1) integrating a cutting-edge high-resolution, time-resolved SPAD array imager for improved photon collection efficiency, spatial resolution, and portability; 2) we will harness the latest developments in Deep Learning (DL) for ultra-fast, quantitative, but fitting/iterative inverse solver-free image formation, in both 2D and 3D providing image formation/processing solutions to facilitate multiplexed imaging; 3) we will implement new functionalities in our imaging platform to enable the concurrent longitudinal imaging of multiple clinically relevant target-receptor interactions (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as metabolic and functional status across the whole-tumor region in live intact animals. NARRATIVE Following an ever increased focus on personalized medicine, there is a continuing need to develop preclinical molecular imaging modalities to guide the development and optimization of targeted therapies. This research program will combine novel time-resolved cameras as well as deep learning techniques to broaden the impact of macroscopic lifetime imaging with the overarching goal to facilitate multiplexed imaging for a comprehensive assessment of cellular delivery efficacy of multiple clinically relevant drugs (e.g. HER receptor family members involved in many cancers) as well as drug response via metabolic and functional status across the whole-tumor region in live intact animals.",In vivo Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Molecular Optical Imaging,9997447,R01CA250636,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Electronics', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Family member', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hemoglobin', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging ligands', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Reporter Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'drug development', 'drug efficacy', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'functional status', 'imager', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multiplexed imaging', 'new technology', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical imaging', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'targeted treatment', 'technological innovation', 'tomography', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly']",NCI,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,637634,0.054878158962995
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,9997783,R01AR074492,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Arthralgia', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Spur', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone remodeling', 'Canes', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fluoride Ion', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Needs Assessment', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteotomy', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone', 'bone metabolism', 'cartilage metabolism', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'flexibility', 'gait examination', 'gait rehabilitation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'joint loading', 'kinetic model', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mineralization', 'molecular marker', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'subchondral bone', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,435694,0.06801006689783577
"NeuroExplorer: Ultra-high Performance Human Brain PET Imager for Highly-resolved In Vivo Imaging of Neurochemistry Research applications of brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) have been in place for over 40 years. The combination of quantitative PET systems with novel radiotracers has led to a numerous imaging para- digms to understand normal brain physiology including neurotransmitter dynamics and receptor pharmacology at rest and during activation. Brain-dedicated PET systems offer important advantages over currently available PET systems in terms of sensitivity and resolution. However, the state-of-the-art for brain PET has not progressed beyond the 20-year-old HRRT. Therefore, there is a compelling need to build the next generation of brain PET systems for human studies. This proposal brings together a highly experienced collaborative team from Yale, UC Davis, and United Imaging Healthcare America (UIHA). to develop the next generation NeuroEXPLORER (NX) PET system with the following Aims. Specific Aim 1: Design and Build the NeuroEXPLORER: In 2 years, we will complete the design and build the NX system. The design includes high performance LYSO-SiPM blocks with small detectors, 4-mm depth-of-interaction, 250 ps time-of-flight resolution, and axial length of ~50 cm, paired with CT for attenuation correction. This design will produce a factor of 10 greater effective sensitivity than the HRRT and practical resolution of 1.5-2 mm in the human brain. The system will include built-in real-time state-of-art motion tracking cameras and will be tested using novel phantom experiments to assess the full-range of operation to validate the dramatic improvement in small- region precision and accuracy. Specific Aim 2: Algorithm Development for Fully-Quantitative Brain PET. We will develop the novel algorithms for this system. Using EXPLORER experience. we will implement reconstruction algorithms to produce dynamic images with uniform ultra-high resolution in space and time, Extending Yale’s HRRT motion correction experience, we will develop camera-based motion detection and correction algorithms to deliver ultra-high resolution human brain images. Using the carotid artery shape and geometry, we will develop methods to accurately measure blood activity to be compared to human arterial data with the goal to permit kinetic modeling without arterial sampling. We will develop noise reduction methods with machine learning to reduce dose for studying health brains and to eliminate the need for the CT scan for attenuation correction. Specific Aim 3: Human Paradigm Demonstration. With human subjects, we will evaluate specific imaging paradigms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NX system: 1) demonstration of the dramatic sensitivity increase (with a direct comparison to the HRRT) and its impact on detection of pharmacologic effects, 2) leveraging high sensitivity to reliably measure uptake in small nuclei; and 3) opening new frontiers of imaging neurotransmitter dynamics, including dopamine and opioid release. The ultimate goal is a fully functioning and characterized system that dramatically expands the scope of brain PET protocols and applications. Human research applications of brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging have been in place for over 40 years and have led to a detailed understand of normal brain physiology including neurotransmitter dynamics and receptor pharmacology at rest and during activation.

"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure. This research proposal seeks to develop a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and monitoring of small-vessel coronary dysfunction by developing innovative and reliable magnetic resonance imaging strategies. Our proposal has the potential to improve patient care in this population by providing a noninvasive alternative to the established invasive testing procedure, which carries a risk of complications and is only available at highly specialized medical centers.",Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI,10037606,R01HL153430,"['Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microspheres', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Nature', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Systole', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'recruit', 'sequence learning']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,699398,0.004652361873045863
"Simultaneous coaxial widefield imaging and reflectance confocal microscopy for improved diagnosis of skin cancers in vivo 1 Dermatologists rely on visual (clinical widefield) and dermoscopic examination of skin lesions to guide the need  2 for biopsy. With this approach, sensitivity is high, but specificity tends to be quite variable and lower, resulting  3 in millions of biopsies of benign lesions every year. To improve specificity, several optical technologies are  4 being developed to noninvasively detect skin cancer. Of these, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is the  5 furthest advanced in clinical utility, proven for diagnosing skin cancers with high sensitivity and specificity.  6 RCM imaging, guided by dermoscopy, detects skin cancers with 2 times superior specificity, and reduces the  7 benign-to-malignant biopsy rate by 2 times, compared to that with dermoscopy alone. In 2016, the Centers for  8 Medicare and Medicaid Services granted current procedural terminology (CPT) reimbursement codes for RCM  9 imaging of skin. RCM imaging combined with dermoscopy is now advancing into clinical practice, sparing pa- 10 tients from unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. However, toward widespread acceptance and adoption, a 11 key challenge is that clinical widefield examination, dermoscopy and RCM imaging are currently performed as 12 three separate procedures with separate devices. Clinicians do not precisely know the location of RCM imag- 13 es relative to the surrounding contextual lesion morphology that is seen with clinical widefield examination and 14 dermoscopy, resulting in lower and more variable diagnostic accuracy (particularly, sensitivity, positive and 15 negative predictive values). We propose a novel solution: (i) a new objective lens with an integrated micro- 16 camera, to deliver a concurrent widefield image of the skin surface surrounding the location of RCM imaging; 17 (ii) a new software algorithm for widefield image-based tracking of the location of RCM images within a dermoscopic 18 field of view; (iii) a new diagnostic approach that will proactively use widefield imaging to locate RCM images in 19 dermoscopic images. We intend to deliver this integrated widefield clinical, dermoscopic and RCM imaging ap- 20 proach into the clinic, toward a new standard for more accurate, consistent and faster RCM imaging to guide 21 patient care. Preliminary studies with a “mock” objective lens and micro-camera on a bench-top set-up 22 demonstrated excellent optical sectioning (~2 µm) and resolution (~1 µm) for RCM imaging, and accurate and 23 repeatable location of RCM fields-of-view within the widefield image. RCM images showed excellent cellular 24 and morphologic detail in vivo. Our specific aims are (1) to develop a handheld reflectance confocal micro- 25 scope with integrated widefield camera; (2) to develop image processing algorithms for real-time widefield im- 26 aging-guided tracking of RCM image locations within dermoscopic fields; (3) to test and validate performance 27 on 100 patients. Although our proposition is for skin lesions, the research will surely have wider impact for 28 imaging in other settings, particularly, with miniaturized confocal microscopes and endoscopes, which have 29 very small fields-of-view. We are a highly synergistic team from Montana State University, Memorial Sloan 30 Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and Caliber Imaging and Diagnostics (formerly, Lucid Inc.). RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Clinical examination and dermoscopy combined with reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging is a newly emerging optical imaging procedure that can noninvasively guide diagnosis of skin cancers, and reduce the need for biopsy. However, clinical examination, dermoscopy and RCM imaging are currently performed as three separate procedures with separate devices, limiting effectiveness and impact. We propose a device to combine the three into a single procedure, which will help dermatologists and patients by making the skin examinations quicker, more accurate and more consistent, expanding the impact of this proven approach.",Simultaneous coaxial widefield imaging and reflectance confocal microscopy for improved diagnosis of skin cancers in vivo,9860776,R01EB028752,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Center', 'Categories', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Current Procedural Terminology', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermatology', 'Dermis', 'Dermoscopy', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Effectiveness', 'Endoscopes', 'Engineering', 'Epidermis', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lesion', 'Lesion by Morphology', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicaid services', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Montana', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical examination', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gastrointestinal', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lens', 'medical specialties', 'microscopic imaging', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'optical imaging', 'prospective test', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'response', 'routine practice', 'skin lesion', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY - BOZEMAN,R01,2020,649717,0.00907313564747538
"Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI Project Summary We propose a technical feasibility study seeking to develop methods for quantitative kinematic proﬁling of moving joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of this study, a kinematic proﬁle is deﬁned as a collection of joint characteristics computed and tracked during the course of movement. This project is motivated by the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. At a high level, it is envisioned that the proposed kinematic proﬁles could ﬁt into clinical management workﬂows much in the same way as blood biomarker panels.  While kinematic imaging of joints can be performed using plain-ﬁlm (PF) X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) methods, MRI is the gold-standard for advanced orthopedic assessment and is an appealing option for accessory kinematic analysis. A set of relatively fast kinematic proﬁling acquisitions could feasibly be added to routine orthopedic MRI exams, thereby providing optimal diagnostic imaging in both static and kinematic contexts within a single visit.  Though several preliminary studies have hinted at the potential diagnostic value of kinematic imaging data, such data is difﬁcult to interpret and cannot easily be quantiﬁed or captured in clinical records. In this study, we seek to establish fundamental methods that can provide simple and easily digestible kinematic imaging reports with data acquired in a short scan interval using conventional clinical MRI equipment.  As a preliminary feasibility investigation of these methods, kinematic imaging of the wrist will be studied. Dysfunction of the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist is a well-studied kinematic problem of diagnostic signiﬁcance. Novel 4D zero-echo-time MRI of the wrist will be used to capture the kinematic imaging using for proﬁling of the scaphoid-lunate mechanics during two established wrist movement patterns.  The goal of this project is to establish and demonstrate methodological components required for MRI kinematic proﬁling. Data collection on a modest-sized cohort of 100 healthy control subjects is proposed for this purpose. Novel MRI pulse-sequence and post-processing development components are introduced and tasked for analysis of this normative data. Using the acquired MRI data, kinematic parameters for each dynamic dataset will be extracted and curated into a multi-parametric proﬁle for each subject.  Aim 2 of the study proposes the use of external sensor motion capture methods to validate the MRI-based kinematic parameter measurements on 50% of the study cohort.  Finally, Aim 3 of the study seeks to use machine-learning clustering approaches to develop a kinematic proﬁle normalization procedure using the acquired control dataset. Such normalization is a crucial milestone in the translation of kinematic proﬁling to the clinic and will establish a baseline for future translational studies of symptomatic cohorts. Project Narrative We seek to develop and demonstrate fundamental methods in quantitative kinematic proﬁling using clinical diagnostic imaging equipment. This technical development project is constructed under the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. Using currently available advanced magnetic resonance imaging technology, data collected from a controlled subject cohort will be used to develop and test the proposed kinematic proﬁling technology on the moving wrist.",Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI,9893679,R21AR075327,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Process', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Film', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Scaphoid bone', 'Semilunar Bone', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Wrist joint', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'blood perfusion', 'bone', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'heart function', 'high resolution imaging', 'human subject', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'motion sensor', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'soft tissue', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'translational study', 'volunteer', 'water diffusion']",NIAMS,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2020,214720,0.039113502667614354
"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,10005896,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2020,952700,0.04375482679544129

"Rapid motion-robust quantitative DCE-MRI for the assessment of gynecologic cancers PROJECT SUMMARY  Gynecologic cancers are some of the most lethal diseases affecting women. Globally, one woman dies of cervical cancer every two minutes. MRI is increasingly used in the evaluation of gynecologic and many other cancers. Beyond its established use for cancer staging, there has long been an interest in the use of MRI-derived quantitative metrics to gain insights into the tumor microenvironment. Parametric maps obtained from quantification of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI data can be used to study tumor vascularity and identify tumors that are better perfused and oxygenated and thus more sensitive to some treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. However, the relative slow imaging speed and motion sensitivity of current MRI technology results in non-reliable and non-reproducible quantification of DCE-MRI data, which restricts its application in clinical practice.  Our group is a world leader in development of rapid motion-resistant DCE-MRI techniques, in particular using combinations of radial imaging and compressed sensing. We developed the technique called GRASP, which was conceived as an academic-industrial partnership and has now been successfully translated into standard clinical practice. Though powerful, the first generation of GRASP has limitations. First, radial imaging is robust to motion, but not free of motion, which usually results in blurring. Second, GRASP uses a very simple sparsifying transform for compressed sensing, which can introduce issues with quantification. Third, GRASP was not originally developed for pharmacokinetic analysis and misses important ingredients such as integration of AIF estimation and T1 mapping. Fourth, image reconstruction time is still very long – in the order of several minutes.  We have developed new advances to circumvent these limitations and offer a new DCE-MRI technique with increased speed, motion-resistance and personalized AIF estimation and T1 mapping for pharmacokinetic analysis. Following the PAR-18-009 guidelines, our main goal is to form an academic-industrial partnership between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and General Electric Healthcare to translate these new developments in quantitative DCE-MRI for use in patients with gynecologic and other type of cancers. Specific Aims are as follows: 1. Develop and implement a fast motion-resistant quantitative DCE-MRI technique that goes beyond GRASP  to offer increased speed and resistance to motion; dynamic T1 mapping; and personalized and automated  pharmacokinetic analysis 2. Evaluate the repeatability, reproducibility and preliminary tumor response assessment of the fast motion-  robust quantitative DCE-MRI technique (“DCE-new”) and compare DCE-new to standard of care DCE-MRI  (“DCE-standard”) in patients with gynecologic cancer 3. Develop and evaluate fast image reconstruction algorithms based on deep learning PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to establish an academic-industrial partnership between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and General Electric Healthcare to develop and disseminate advances in dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI for use in cancer patients. The new developments, which include radial imaging, compressed sensing, and deep learning, will deliver rapid motion-resistant DCE-MRI with high spatial and temporal resolution for more accurate and reproducible quantification of MRI-derived metrics. The new technology to be disseminated as a prototype on GE scanners will promote the use of quantitative DCE-MRI biomarkers in clinical practice, a long-desired goal.",Rapid motion-robust quantitative DCE-MRI for the assessment of gynecologic cancers,10052888,R01CA244532,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Early treatment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Gynecologic', 'Gynecology', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Radial', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Speed', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'advanced disease', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'motion sensitivity', 'new technology', 'novel', 'population based', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2020,535197,0.022564415429864624
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9903426,R01HL115828,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Sex Differences', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'aortic valve', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,747084,0.02284912762585804
"Development of a Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) Summary. Our long-term goal is to develop a powerful tool based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) for non- invasive human skin imaging in order to improve clinical diagnosis, guide effective treatment and advance clinical and cosmetic/pharmaceutical research by providing access to dynamic cellular and molecular processes during therapy. MPM is a nonlinear optical imaging technique that provides unique structural and molecular contrast based on endogenous signals such as second harmonic generation from collagen and two- photon excited fluorescence from NADH/FAD+, keratin, melanin and elastin fibers. This contrast allows MPM to provide multi-color, rich molecular information content images that can enhance diagnostic accuracy. MPM overcomes fundamental limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging and extends the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. Validation of the clinical potential of this technology has been facilitated over the past 10 years by a device developed by Jenlab in Germany, currently the only clinical MPM system on the market. This device has technical limitations in terms of field-of-view (FOV), imaging speed, complexity and cost, which are major barriers to clinical adoption. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of a MPM system that is highly optimized for rapid, label-free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution. The Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) imaging platform will incorporate the innovative optical engine of a benchtop prototype developed at BLI. InfraDerm will innovate on this design to transform it into a compact, portable device, suitable for human skin imaging in clinical setting. Key innovations include: 1) a compact engineering design based on integrating a compact fs fiber laser into the imaging head along with a customized folded optical design to reduce complexity and cost and enhance portability; 2) hardware and software strategies that include a customized patient interface and a combination of optical and mechanical scanning mechanisms with deep learning image restoration to allow millimeter-to-centimeter scale imaging within minutes while maintaining sub-micron resolution. This approach will expand the in vivo imaging area from mm to cm scale, which will be scanned within minutes with sub- cellular resolution. In Aim 1 we will develop the FLAME prototype that incorporates these features. In Aim 2 we will test its technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging by evaluating potential effects of motion artifacts. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate the FLAME system potential for non-invasive assessment of melanin content, an ability with potential impact in differential diagnosis and early assessment of treatment efficacy of pigmentary skin disorders, such as melasma. Phase II will refine the technological approach and will test the device feasibility in a first clinical application, differential diagnosis of patients with melasma, a long time dermatology challenge and a particular interest for pharma companies developing therapies for this skin condition. Narrative  InfraDerm LLC proposes to develop and test the technical feasibility for in vivo human skin imaging of a laser scanning microscope based on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) that addresses fundamental and technical limitations of existing optical imaging technologies for sub-surface skin imaging, extending the area of applicability beyond skin lesions that can be diagnosed through morphological assessment alone. The proposed Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME) prototype will be highly optimized for rapid, label- free, macroscopic imaging of human skin with microscopic resolution. An MPM clinical platform, uniquely equipped with this combination of features would embody an innovative and commercially viable product that will broadly impact clinical diagnosis and research in dermatology as well as in cosmetic and pharmaceutical research.",Development of a Fast Large Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME),10153566,R43EB030931,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Alopecia', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biopsy', 'Cell physiology', 'Chloasma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Cosmetics', 'Custom', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disclosure', 'Elastin', 'Elastin Fiber', 'Excision', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Face', 'Fiber', 'Fluorescence', 'Generations', 'Germany', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Keratin', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Melanins', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'NADH', 'Nevus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pigments', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective therapy', 'engineering design', 'human imaging', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'millimeter', 'multiphoton imaging', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'optical imaging', 'portability', 'prototype', 'response', 'restoration', 'second harmonic', 'skin disorder', 'skin lesion', 'submicron', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIBIB,"INFRADERM, LLC",R43,2020,263074,0.038840258888674886
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9999688,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,192564,0.007655652363801158
"A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials Project Summary/Abstract There has been a shift to greater use of neadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in the clinical management of cancer. Often used in breast cancer to provide systemic treatment for possible or apparent metastatic disease, NACT also reduces the primary tumor size and facilitates breast conservation. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is an effective diagnostic for monitoring tumor regression. There are many methodologies being developed for monitoring cancer in vivo, including contrast agent washout, volumetry, and more recently correlating apparent diffusion coefficients and proton relaxation times to tumor staging. Such imaging biomarkers are predictive of the pathological complete response (pCR) outcome prior to surgery. This enables physicians to provide “evidence based” treatment modifications to reduce deleterious side effects and improve patient outcomes. To obtain quantitative data from MR images, the variations that occur in imaging as a result of hardware and software differences between MRI manufacturers and day-to-day operations must be quantified. In MRI, the data depends on the protocols used to acquire the image, resulting in inconsistencies if even one parameter in the protocol changes. The goal of the proposed work is to produce and develop and disseminate a ground truth physical standard and quality control program for comparison of MRI scanners in the multisite I-SPY2 (ACRIN 6698) trials monitoring pre-operative chemotherapy treatments in the reduction of tumor size. The physical standard is an anthropomorphic breast phantom capable of fitting into all commercial breast coils. It contains novel human tissue mimics and geometric standards with values traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Analysis software capable of protocol compliance checks, rapid identification of the regions of interest, and comparison to ground truth values as measured by NIST will be developed to complement the physical standard. This will enable qualification of sites and quantification of error resulting from scanner performance alone. Given the wide breadth of parameter space that MRI protocols encompass, part of the proposed effort will include the development of protocols specific to image acquisition of tumor volumes and for measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient within the tumor volumes as compared to surrounding healthy tissue. Project Narrative: Quantitative imaging complements precision medicine initiatives by providing a noninvasive method of monitoring gene specific in vivo treatment of diseases ranging from cancer to neurological disorders. To realize quantitative imaging, variations in imaging hardware, software, and procedures must be mitigated. This project will develop a quality assurance and quality control procedure for multisite clinical trials involved in monitoring therapeutic efficacy using MR breast imaging.",A Quality Control Program for Quantitative MRI Data  Acquisition and Analysis in Multi-site Clinical Trials,10018825,R44CA235820,"['Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Breast', 'Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Breast conservation', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diffusion', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality Control', 'Reading', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Volume', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cloud based', 'computer aided detection', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'human tissue', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'nervous system disorder', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'operation', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'quality assurance', 'quantitative imaging', 'side effect', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,"CALIBERMRI, INC.",R44,2020,183388,-0.026506743660064662
"Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee Project Abstract Motivation: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful disease that affects tens of millions of Americans, but is poorly understood, resulting in a lack of treatments. Enabling low-cost approaches for widespread study of risk factors, onset and early progression of OA will enable better understanding of OA mechanisms, treatment development, and triage of patients to different treatments based on speciﬁc disease phenotypes. Multiple systemic factors, biochemical factors, and other risk factors are associated with OA, but causes are difﬁ- cult to isolate and study during slow progression. Currently OA is diagnosed as joint-space narrowing using X-ray radiography, at a stage well beyond when interventions can be effective. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of- fers sensitivity to morphologic and biochemical changes, but most methods are impractical for widespread clinical or research use. Usually MRI exams study only one knee, precluding the opportunity to compare knees. Sim- ilarly, biomechanics assessment typically requires numerous tests using advanced and rarely-available equip- ment and time-intensive analysis by skilled personnel, making this a challenge for widespread use. We have shown rapid, simultaneous 3D scanning of both knees with quantitative relaxometry and diffusion map- ping of connective tissues, combined with novel visualization of longitudinal change validated in a population with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. We have developed fully-automated cartilage and meniscus seg- mentation to simplify post-processing. (Our automated cartilage segmentation variability approaches that of reader-to-reader variability.) We now propose to combine MRI acquisition, reconstruction and analysis tech- niques with simple measures of kinematics into a widely applicable low-cost imaging and biomechanical test, which we will validate in subjects with ACL-injury and subjects with varying Kellgren-Lawrence grades of OA. Approach: We will begin by developing a robust 5-to-8-minute bilateral knee MRI exam, using an efﬁcient 3D isotropic acquisition and novel deep-learning based image reconstructions. This will be followed with automated cartilage segmentation and quantitative analysis (thickness, T2, diffusion) of all 3 knee plates and automated semiquantitative scoring approaches for synovitis, bone marrow and cartilage lesions. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) will be used to measure kinematics, and gait asymmetries. We will continue our studies in ACL pa- tients to validate techniques and to develop asymmetry analyses for both imaging and biomechanical measures. Finally, in subjects with varying OA grade, we will evaluate the potential of the overall low-cost approach to relate asymmetry and longitudinal change measures to progression and OA grade. Signiﬁcance: This project will develop an acquisition and analysis pipeline to quantify knee changes and left/right asymmetries that precede OA. We will characterize methods in idiopathic OA subjects and ACL- injured subjects at risk of post-traumatic OA. The very low target cost, under $120/subject, will ultimately enable widespread study of early onset and progression of different OA types, leading to earlier and better treatments. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis remains the leading cause of disability, and effective treatment will require efﬁcient assessment of disease risk-factors, onset, and progression, both for development and personalization of minimally invasive interventions. We propose a 5-minute 3D MRI exam of both knees without radiation or contrast injection, that will be combined with low-cost measures of knee motion and fully automated analysis methods to provide quan- titative measurements of cartilage, tendon, ligament, bone and ﬁbrocartilage health and asymmetries between knees. This low-cost, rapid, bilateral assessment will enable research studies in large populations, as well as adding quantitative bilateral information to clinical scans to dramatically improve understanding of onset of dif- ferent types of osteoarthritis.",Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee,10032904,R01AR077604,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Articulation', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Spur', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cost Measures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Fibrocartilages', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammatory', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kellgren-Lawrence grade', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Slice', 'Surface', 'Synovitis', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'anterior cruciate ligament injury', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'gait examination', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'learning classifier', 'meniscus injury', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'sensor', 'societal costs', 'therapy development', 'tissue biomarkers']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,658342,0.01845190094106436
"Multimodal mass spectrometry imaging of mouse and human liver We propose to develop a multimodal mass spectrometry imaging pipeline with novel desorption sources and data integration that will enable simultaneously mapping of biomolecule abundance in 3-dimensions in biological tissues at high spatial resolution (micron to submicron) and high speed (>10 ms/pixel) in a near-native environment. This would provide previously inaccessible information on cellular and tissue organization, and how homeostasis and disease intersect at the level of tissue physiology. A major challenge for performing multi- omics using mass spectrometry imaging has been the (i) lack of universal ionization methods, (ii) limited sample preparation protocols for preserving chemical gradients, (iii) low sensitivity, and (iv) limited tools for integration of large quantities of data. Our laboratories are developing systematic MS imaging for high sensitivity and high resolution analysis of diverse tissues. We discovered that water-based gas cluster ion beams (H2O-GCIB) operating at high energy yield ionization enhancements of multiple biomolecules (e.g., metabolites, lipids, and peptides/protein fragments) with high sensitivity at 1 µm lateral resolution and without labeling or complicated sample preparation. Coupled with unique Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) instrumentation and cryogenic sample handling, we have imaged biomolecules directly in cells and tissues in a near-native state (i.e., frozen-hydration) with feature resolution of 1-10 µm. Low concentration biomolecules (e.g. cardiolipin and metabolites) that were impossible to localize in single cells previously are now visible with 3-dimensional localization. Moreover, the sufficient signal per pixel, we can use automated data analysis to characterize biologically active functional sites within 1 µm2 and areas of interest in single cells. We further developed data integration methods to combine imaging data from adjacent sections to create a multi-model imaging data sets. We propose to develop a pipeline for MS imaging analysis of biomolecules, and to elucidate molecular heterogeneity in tissues using multimodal imaging. To support the multi-modal analysis pipeline, we will develop an integrated data analysis platform. Integration of multiomics remains challenging, particularly spatially localize multiple biomolecules at single cell level. The direct visualization of cellular contents provides information on biomolecular composition, interactions and functions. This network of biomolecules is the driving force of specific behavior of cells in physiological states. Despite this, a comprehensive grasp of these interactions at cellular level has not moved beyond segregated methods. Our efforts will result in an integrated multimodal imaging platform to summon the best characteristics of each image form, acquiring a complete picture the biomolecular network at spatial resolution of 1 µm. With this direct visualization, we will address how metabolism links with functional biomarkers that stem from metabolism-associated protein complexes and phase-separated membrane-less organelles at the subcellular level, and how this drive different cell death modalities, including different modes of cell death. We propose to develop a new mass spectrometry imaging pipeline that will enable mapping of biomolecules in in biological tissues at high spatial resolution.

"The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform: An intuitive tool facilitating secure multi-institutional collaboration ABSTRACT: Accurate segmentation of solid tumors is challenging, due to their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location, as well as their appearance variation caused by the diversity of medical imaging. Manual annotation is tedious, prone to misinterpretation, human error, and observer bias. All these factors hinder further image analysis towards understanding tumor radio-phenotypes, predicting clinical outcomes, and monitoring progression patterns. Computational competitions have been seeking optimal advanced computational segmentation algorithms (ACSAs) for specific abnormalities, by pooling multi-institutional data together and benchmarking ACSAs from international groups. Along these lines, we have been successfully leading the organization of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, since 2012, towards a publicly-available pooled dataset of 542 multi-parametric MRI scans of glioma patients from 19 institutions. In the summarized analysis of all BraTS results, we have shown that although individual ACSAs do not outperform the gold standard agreement across expert clinicians, their fusion does outperform it, in terms of both accuracy and consistency across subjects. Towards the wider application of these ACSAs, in 2017 we created the BraTS algorithmic repository to make available Docker containers of individual ACSAs, created by BraTS participants. However, fusion of these ACSAs is still out of reach for clinical researchers, as there is no graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate it, and execution of such algorithms requires substantial computational background by the user. Furthermore, although competitions such as BraTS have shown promise, they cannot easily scale due to the requirement of pooling patient data from multiple institutions to a single location, that often faces legal, privacy, and data-ownership concerns. These concerns motivate distributed learning solutions, where the data are always retained within their institutions. We have been investigating such solutions to avoid the current paradigm of multi-institutional collaboration, i.e., data-sharing, and considering their potential multi-institutional adoption, with respect to privacy, scalability, and performance, we found federated learning (FL) to be most appropriate. In FL, each institution trains a model and shares it (without patient data) with an aggregation server, which then integrates institutional models in parallel and distributes back a consensus model. In this proposal, we focus on developing the open- source Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform, which with a user-friendly GUI will aim at i) bringing pre- trained models of various ACSAs and their fusion closer to clinical experts, and ii) allowing secure multi- institutional collaborations via FL to improve these pre-trained models without sharing patient data, thereby overcoming legal, privacy, and data-ownership challenges. Successful completion of this project will lead to an easy-to-use potentially-translatable tool enabling easy, fast, objective, repeatable and accurate tumor segmentation, without requiring a computational background by the user, and while facilitating further analysis of tumor radio-phenotypes towards accelerating discovery. NARRATIVE: Successful completion of this project will lead to a clinically translatable, easy-to-use software tool that offers a) pre-trained tumor segmentation models and their fusion, to perform better than experts, and b) a federated learning framework facilitating secure multi-institutional collaborations to improve these pre-trained models without the need to share patient data, thereby overcoming legal, privacy, and data-ownership challenges, towards accelerating research of cancer radio-phenotypes.",The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform: An intuitive tool facilitating secure multi-institutional collaboration,10009302,U01CA242871,"['Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Docking', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Observer Variation', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Radio', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm training', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'contrast enhanced', 'graphical user interface', 'human error', 'improved', 'interactive tool', 'light weight', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'repository', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U01,2020,360393,0.015813274755835893
"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders. This project will develop a robust noninvasive imaging technique using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that offers high spatial resolution, resistance to head motion and accurate quantification of cerebral blood flow in children and adolescents.

"Development and Dissemination of Clinical CEST MRI Acquisition and Analysis Methods for Cancer Imaging Applications This research plan will continue our development of Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI acquisition and analysis methods for imaging patients with cancer. AcidoCEST MRI with an exogenous contrast agent is an innovative variation of this technique that measures extracellular pH in solid tumors. We have also developed an exceptionally innovative method that acquires endogenous CEST MR images with multiple powers, which can measure the chemical exchange rate of endogenous proteins that can assess relative differences in pH. We will improve our CEST MRI acquisition methods by accelerating the imaging speed, reducing and eliminating complications due to patient motion, eliminating complications caused by fat signal, and expanding to 3D imaging methods. We will also improve image analysis methods that are required for CEST contrast from endogenous proteins and exogenous contrast agents.  Our research has strong impact because acidoCEST MRI can track changes in tumor acidosis in response to chemotherapy and chemoradiation therapy in patients who have breast cancer and head & neck cancer. Endogenous CEST MRI can improve the diagnoses of brain tumor recurrence vs. pseudoprogression, and evaluations of lung cancer vs. lung infection. We will perform clinical studies with our endogenous and exogenous CEST MRI methods to image patients with brain, breast, lung, and head & neck cancers.  To amplify the impact of our research, we will develop versions of our CEST MRI acquisition methods for the many versions of the 13 Siemens hardware platforms and software operating systems at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. We will also develop user-friendly CEST analysis methods for many researchers at MD Anderson. We will leverage our unique research environment and expertise with intra-institutional dissemination to provide inter-institutional dissemination, by sharing share these acquisition and analysis tools with other CEST MRI researchers. We will collaborate with NIST to provide the first CEST MRI phantom that can standardize the development and implementation of intra- and inter-institutional CEST MRI methods.  Our team of outstanding investigators includes experts in CEST saturation methods, CEST MR image analysis, clinical contrast agents, rapid MRI acquisition methods, high field 7T MRI, clinical radiology, biostatistics, histopathology and oncology. Based on our expertise and years of productivity in clinical CEST MRI, we have developed an exceptional research approach. As the world's largest cancer center and a health destination, the MD Anderson Cancer Center has the patient population that provides very strong institutional support for our clinical studies. NARRATIVE We will develop new acquisition and analysis methods that assess tumor acidosis with CEST MRI, using exogenous CEST agents and endogenous sources of CEST contrast. We will apply our new methods to evaluate tumor acidosis in patients with breast, head & neck, lung, and brain cancers. We will disseminate our CEST MRI acquisition and analysis methods to other CEST MRI researchers, along with a NIST-approved standard for clinical CEST MRI studies.",Development and Dissemination of Clinical CEST MRI Acquisition and Analysis Methods for Cancer Imaging Applications,10017170,R01CA231513,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Center', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Custom', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fingerprint', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Head Cancer', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Implant', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Lung infections', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Neck Cancer', 'Non-Malignant', 'Oncology', 'Operating System', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemical standard', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'extracellular', 'frontier', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'interest', 'lung imaging', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'ovarian neoplasm', 'patient population', 'preclinical study', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2020,657412,0.013676654727897433
"Advancing MRI technology for early diagnosis of liver metastases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Liver is commonly involved in metastatic disease in colorectal cancer (CRC) and knowledge about the presence and location of these tumors affects treatment decisions. In patients with CRC, surgical or ablative treatment of liver metastases improves overall survival. Early diagnosis of colorectal metastases (i.e. while lesions are small) is expected to improve treatment outcomes by increasing the number of subjects that can undergo surgical resection or by identifying subjects early on, when non-surgical options are an alternative treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is regarded as the most effective imaging modality for the detection and characterization of liver neoplasms; T2-weighted (T2w) and T1-weighted (T1w) images - combined with administration of a gadolinium chelate agent and multi-phase dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) - are the foundational acquisitions used for the detection and characterization of liver tumors. However, challenges remain for the detection and characterization of small lesions due to factors including inadequate spatial resolution, partial volume effects, physiological motion, and variations in timing of contrast arrival in DCE imaging. In this academic-industrial partnership the scientific and engineering teams at the University of Arizona and Siemens Medical Solutions are coming together to develop robust radial MRI techniques for T2w/T2 mapping and DCE imaging of the liver to improve detection and characterization of small tumors with the goal of bringing these techniques to routine clinical practice. The proposed work is based on a radial turbo spin-echo technique pioneered by the team at the University of Arizona for abdominal imaging and a radial stack- of-stars technique with continuous acquisition for DCE imaging. The specific aims of the partnership are: Aim 1: To develop radial T2w acquisition and reconstruction techniques with efficient full coverage of the liver for small tumor detection and accurate T2 quantification for tumor characterization. Aim 2: To implement a self-navigated 3D radial stack-of-stars technique for continuous acquisition of DCE data and retrospective reconstruction of the dynamic phases. Aim 3: To conduct a clinical evaluation of the techniques from Aims 1 and 2 against conventional T2w and DCE techniques. Aim 4: To streamline translation of the new radial methods to the clinic by developing a computationally efficient reconstruction pipeline. The endpoints of our study include technical advances in MRI acquisitions that markedly overcome limitations of current liver MRI for the diagnosis of early metastases. We expect our proposal to yield technology improvements that will increase precision of care and outcomes in patients with metastatic malignancies, in particular those with colorectal cancer.

"Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI Project Summary: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is an impairment of urine flow from the renal pelvis into the proximal ureter and is the most common cause of hydronephrosis in neonates. This disorder is detected in up to 7% of all maternal ultrasound scans, and an estimated 10% of these newborns have hydronephrosis, which, if left untreated, may result in early failure of functional renal development in these patients. Current methods of assessing kidney function in neonates and children are less than optimal, however. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information; it is invasive, slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a method for functional imaging of kidneys that is non-invasive, safe, accurate, reproducible and radiation-free. The primary objective of this exploratory, two-year study, therefore, is two-fold: first, to develop advanced methods of motion-compensated, high spatial and temporal resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the improved quantification of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), an important marker of renal function; and second, to demonstrate the superiority of this method over the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3). Our application in response to PAR-18-743 is specifically aimed at developing, and evaluating motion-robust, high spatiotemporal resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) for quantifying GFR (MR-GFR) as well as creating new automated analysis software to enable the robust and reproducible assessment of differential renal function in newborns eliminating need for sedation, and in older children. Our method will overcome the technical challenges of current DCE-MRI techniques providing high temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function dynamics required for accurate computation of GFR, compensate for unavoidable respiratory and bulk motion to reconstruct high quality images and will provide robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate GFR computation. As a non-invasive, motion-robust, radiation-free imaging technique that can depict renal structures at much higher resolution, MR-GFR will offer, for the first time, a level of diagnostic information that is unattainable with MAG3. The critical importance of understanding the extent and severity of UPJO (and resulting hydronephrosis) cannot be understated; for in the absence of this information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgery might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment; and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., watching waiting) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. Indeed, this novel imaging approach is expected to substantially improve clinical decision-making. The successful completion of our aims will enable 1) assessment of renal function accurately; 2) predicting the likelihood of functional decline; and 3) determining whether surgery is indicated. DCE-MRI is expected to have rapid translational impact for several diseases effecting kidney function once it is introduced into clinical practice. Project Narrative: This project addresses the need to develop advanced methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess kidney function in newborns and in older children who have been diagnosed with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), an impairment of urine flow that is the most common cause of hydronephrosis (inability to void urine). Unfortunately, severe hydronephrosis, left untreated, can result in permanent damage to the child's kidneys and our novel method of assessing kidney function, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), promises to evaluate the extent of this disorder in a way that is highly accurate, non- invasive, safe, reliable, and radiation-free and will eliminate the need of repeated scans, sedation and anesthesia when imaging newborns with congenital hydronephrosis. Most importantly, this approach will enable the clinician to confidently and quickly refer children for corrective surgery based on imaging results; and likewise, recommend other children for more conservative “watchful-waiting”, effectively reducing the number of unnecessary surgeries.",Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI,9877232,R21DK123569,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age-Months', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drainage procedure', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Free Will', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gadolinium', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Hospitalization', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Lower urinary tract', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Nephrectomy', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nuclear', 'Obstruction', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pentetic Acid', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sedation procedure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Ureter', 'Ureteropelvic junction obstruction', 'Urine', 'Urology', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'care costs', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep neural network', 'functional decline', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney imaging', 'kinetic model', 'neonate', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'renal artery', 'respiratory', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'translational impact', 'urologic']",NIDDK,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,221250,-0.028114176362421466
"Risk Assessment of Cerebral Aneurysm Growth with 4D flow MRI PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to determine the contribution of hemodynamic factors to risk assessment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) and calculate these factors from enhanced in vivo 4D flow MRI data. Even though most UIAs are stable, the majority of UIA patients are offered interventional treatment due to the grave risk presented if an aneurysm ruptures. Previous studies indicated that in addition to clinical (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities) and morphological (e.g., location and size) factors, UIA progression is affected by local blood flow dynamics. Hemodynamic factors associated with UIA growth can be obtained from computational and experimental models or from 4D flow MRI measurements; however, each approach has limitations. The previous NIH-funded project focused on developing image-based computational methods for predicting postoperative flow following interventions. The goal of this renewal is to use the developed framework to improve risk stratification of UIAs using image-based flow analysis. The proposed project will develop multi-parametric predictive models that combine clinical and morphological factors with hemodynamic factors calculated from augmented 4D flow MRI data. The UIA growth predicted by different models will be compared to outcomes observed in longitudinal imaging studies. The aims of the proposed project are, therefore, to: (1) determine the probability of UIA growth by utilizing morphological and clinical factors together with hemodynamic factors obtained from computational and experimental flow models by a) performing statistical analysis based on morphological and clinical factors obtained from longitudinal imaging, and b) extending statistical model by including hemodynamic factors computed from patient-specific models; (2) Enhance 4D flow MRI data by a) determining 4D flow reproducibility and variability with in vitro studies, and b) applying advanced data augmentation methods to improve the accuracy of calculated hemodynamic factors affecting aneurysm growth; (3) determine the probability of UIA growth based on multi-parametric analysis utilizing hemodynamic factors calculated from enhanced 4D flow MRI. Successful completion of the project will resolve the controversy regarding how hemodynamic factors affect aneurysm growth and establish 4D flow MRI as a diagnostic tool for UIA risk stratification. This collaborative project engages the cardiovascular engineering group at Purdue University and neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists and MRI physicists at Northwestern University, University of California San Francisco and Barrow Neurological Institute. This cross-disciplinary team will bring together experts in neurovascular surgeries, MRI velocimetry, patient-specific flow computations, experimental fluid mechanics and statistical analysis. Retrospective and prospective UIAs data obtained from these superb clinical centers will be used in this study. The outstanding engineering resources available at Purdue and world-class imaging resources at Northwestern, UC San Francisco and Barrow, as well as existing the data sharing agreements between these institutions and ongoing collaborations between the PIs, will ensure the project's success. PROJECT NARRATIVE The majority of brain aneurysms are treated, despite the fact that most of them have very low risk or rupture. Studies indicated that brain aneurysm risk factors include a range of clinical (e.g., patient’s age, sex, family history) and anatomical (e.g., aneurysm location, size and shape) parameters, as well as local blood flow dynamics. The proposed studies will determine the specific contribution of blood flow variables for improving the risk assessment of brain aneurysms and examine whether these variables can be reliably calculated from flow velocities measured with phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging.",Risk Assessment of Cerebral Aneurysm Growth with 4D flow MRI,10052679,R01HL115267,"['4D MRI', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Angiography', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Aneurysms', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cerebral Aneurysm', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'San Francisco', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Velocimetries', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'data sharing', 'enhancing factor', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neurovascular', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'residence', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'shear stress', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,707635,0.012347725227597197
"3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry PROJECT SUMMARY This project aims to develop and test two innovative platforms and related software for 3-D imaging flow cytometry of fluorescent or absorbing (stained) samples. These systems will allow 3-D structural and functional imaging of many single cells at a subcellular resolution and at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or recently in 2-D imaging. Thereby, the proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways cultured cells, patient-derived samples, and small experimental organisms are studied. Automated classification based on the 3-D features will enable the diagnosis of hematologic disorders at single-cell precision. Existing 3-D microscopy methods can provide the same information at higher resolution; however, by relying on a scanning mechanism they cannot be applied to suspending cells, especially in a flow configuration, which is essential for high-speed interrogation. Snapshot 3-D microscopy techniques have been developed to address this challenge, but they have insufficient spatial resolution for single-cell imaging and suffer from long data processing time. We overcome these limitations by combining two novel snapshot techniques developed by the PI with the most rigorous optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. We will use an array of lenslets, which simultaneously records many projection images corresponding with different viewing angles. The use of pupil phase masks, designed using wavefront coding and a theory of 3-D high-numerical-aperture optical imaging, will increase the resolution of each projection image to the theoretical limit given by the objective-lens numerical aperture. The target resolution is 0.5 µm, which is comparable to existing 2-D imaging flow cytometry systems. The target imaging throughputs based on current component technologies are 120 volumes/sec for fluorescence imaging and 700 volumes/sec for absorption imaging, which are higher than 100 volumes/sec of cutting-edge 3-D optical microscopy for stationary specimens. The vast amount of data acquired by these 3-D imaging systems imposes a serious challenge to data processing. The developed systems record true projection images, which obviate iterative deconvolution process, thereby allowing much faster tomographic reconstruction than in existing snapshot techniques. Using general-purpose graphics processing units and optical diffraction tomography, which includes the diffraction of light by subcellular organelles, our tomographic reconstruction algorithm will be faster yet more accurate than existing approaches. Further, we will explore the feasibility of applying a deep convolutional neural network to the images acquired by the developed systems for accurate single-cell classification based on 3-D features. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop 3-D imaging flow cytometry platforms for fluorescent or absorbing (stained) cells at high resolution and high throughput in a flow configuration. The developed systems will be built upon two novel snapshot 3-D techniques developed by the PI in combination with most rigorous 3-D optical imaging theories and cutting-edge component technologies. The proposed methods have the potential to fundamentally change the ways that biological specimens are examined by allowing 3-D structural and functional imaging of suspending cells at a scale that used to be available only in flow cytometry or 2-D imaging.",3-D Imaging Flow Cytometry,10023268,R21GM135848,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Functional Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Hematological Disease', 'Holography', 'Image', 'Laboratory Organism', 'Leukocytes', 'Lifting', 'Lighting', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Records', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diffraction of light', 'digital', 'feature extraction', 'fluorescence imaging', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'lens', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'software development', 'targeted imaging', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure', 'tomography']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2020,155784,0.010480708534956702
"2020 OSA Optical Coherence Tomography Meeting NIBIB PROPOSAL – ABSTRACT 2020 OSA Optical Coherence Tomography Meeting  Biophotonics technologies have clear medical and clinical applications. However, the transformation and translation from the research lab to the clinic, and then to market is a complex process. The 2020 OSA Optical Coherence Tomography meeting will be held on 20-23 April 2020 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in parallel with other four topical meetings (Clinical and Translational Biophotonics, Optical Tomography and Spectroscopy, Microscopy, Histopathology and Analytics, Optics and the Brain) within the same congress, the 2020 OSA Biophotonics Congress: Biomedical Optics. The ultimate objective of this conference is to disseminate recent developments in the field of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and inspire new ideas through various forms of interactions within a broad audience that includes engineers, natural scientists (physicists, biologists, chemists, etc.), clinical researchers, industrial R&D and market experts. The meeting will report on the latest advances in this field and discuss how the OCT field can be advanced in the near future. In addition to addressing the use of adaptive optics to improve image quality, emphasis will be placed on advanced techniques to use OCT for functional imaging, real time volumetric imaging and rendering, and imaging for diagnostic and surgical guidance applications. New topics to be covered are the development and application of advanced image processing algorithms to interpret to imaging data.  A unique advantage of co-locating this meeting within a congress and presenting joint plenary sessions is the extended cross-fertilization between experts in in the distinct but synergic fields. Technical sessions that include innovative methods such as campfire, fishbowl sessions or unconference, and special programming will ensure the meetings' success as the leading forum for presenting the latest advances, while providing an ideal setting to learn. This meeting will provide an opportunities for students and early career professionals to present their work, participate in professional development activities, hear from and network with internationally-renowned speakers and participate in special programming. Ultimately, holding high-quality scientific and technical meeting, where best-in-class research is presented and discussed will advance knowledge in the field of biomedical optics and biophotonics and propel technological development forward, while augmenting standard academic training and presenting opportunities for career advancement, especially for students and early career professionals. NIBIB PROPOSAL – PROJECT NARRATIVE 2020 OSA Optical Coherence Tomography Meeting The 2020 OSA Optical Coherence Tomography Meetings will bring together many of the leaders in the OCT field, who will report on the latest advances in this field and discuss how the OCT field can be advanced in the near future, including developing and evaluating new imaging approaches to solve important clinical problems.

"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9850978,R01EB016695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,569563,-0.007416126399798103
"Quantitative Low-Dose PET Imaging Project summary Quantitative PET has become increasingly important in clinical management and research, in particular for predicting and assessing response to therapy for cancer patients. Current PET protocols involve injection of PET tracers that typically result in ~6-7 mSv radiation dose to patients. For patients who require multiple repeated PET scans to monitor the response to therapy, and for patients who need PET scans with two or more tracers (e.g., FDG + FLT) to optimally predict response to therapy, it is critical to reduce the radiation dose from the PET tracer injection, while still maintaining the quantitative accuracy and image quality for cancer management. When reducing injection dose, the PET images will have higher noise due to fewer detected counts, which will subsequently introduce errors in quantitative measurements. For moving organs and tumors such as those in the lung and abdomen, respiratory motion can substantially degrade quantitative accuracy, so motion correction is required. Conventional motion correction uses a gating strategy that rebins the PET data, resulting in substantially higher noise in each gate. More advanced methods incorporate motion vector estimation in the image domain for post-registration or motion compensated image reconstruction using all detected events without increasing noise. The motion vectors need to be derived from gated PET, which are even noisier when using a reduced tracer injection in low-dose studies, imposing substantial challenges for accurate and reliable voxel-by-voxel motion vector estimation. In dynamic PET studies with clinical cardiac tracers and other novel oncology and neurology tracers, quantification is even more challenging for low-dose PET as each dynamic frame only contains a small fraction of detected events so the high image noise will affect the determination of image-derived input functions and can lead to bias and high noise in parametric images. In this project, to reduce image noise and maintain quantitative accuracy in PET, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple innovative imaging methods for low-dose PET data to achieve comparable quantitative accuracy as full-dose PET. While the imaging developments are generally applicable to all PET tracers in oncology, neurology, and cardiology, since cancer is the primary clinical application of PET, we will focus our investigation and optimization in this project on three lung cancer imaging tracers at different clinical adoption stages as examples: 1) 18F-FDG as a routine clinical tracer, 2) 18F-FMISO for hypoxia studies as a tracer for human research, and 3) 18F-PD-L1 that specifically binds to human PD-L1 in tumors and other organs as a recent first-in-human tracer. For each tracer, we will investigate 1) static PET, 2) gated and respiratory motion corrected PET, and 3) dynamic PET. Project narrative Patient radiation dose is a major concern in PET imaging. This project will be an important step to develop and standardize low-dose PET imaging methods and provide guidance for clinical practice, research studies, and both single and multiple site clinical trials for PET dose reduction.

"Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Abstract PET is a molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology studies due to its high sensitivity and the potential of early diagnosis. For neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), 68Ga-DOTATATE PET has been recently used in clinical routine for imaging NETs in adult and pediatric patients since 2016. It plays an important role in the diagnosis and staging of NETs. However, compared to 18F-FDG PET, the image quality of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is lower due to much larger positron range, shorter half-life, and lower dose administration limited by generator capacity. All of these compromises the lesion detectability of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET, especially for small lesions, and can potentially lead to inaccurate NET diagnosis. As 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is increasingly used in clinics, there is an urgent and unmet need to further optimize 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging for NET detection. Recently, data-driven methods have been developed for PET image denoising, where the PET system model is not considered. As the tumor-to-background ratio of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is greater than 18F-FDG PET, the lesion recovery of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET can be hugely influenced by the smoothing effects as well as potential mismatches between training and testing datasets. In this study, we propose a novel data- informed and lesion detection-driven image reconstruction framework. The PET system model, image denoising module, and lesion-detection module will all be included in this reconstruction framework. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop a lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework and validate it based on comprehensive computer simulations, (2) to apply the proposed reconstruction framework to existing clinical 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT datasets and test it based on various figure-of-merits. We expect that the integrated outcome of the specific aims will be a novel and robust image reconstruction framework to better recover lesions in a 68Ga- DOTATATE PET scan, which is essential for NET managements. Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection  Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality widely used in oncology. This project aims to develop a novel lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework. Success of this project can enhance the lesion detectability of current PET imaging protocols, e.g. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scanning for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).",Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection,10041119,R03EB030280,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gallium', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Noise', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer type', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'neural network', 'neuroendocrine differentiation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'pentetreotide', 'radiologist', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'routine imaging', 'success', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2020,94255,0.006335438802427245
"Enabling the Next Generation of High Performance Pediatric Whole Body MR Imaging Project Abstract Motivation: We aim to develop and implement a new approach to transform pediatric MRI. The ultimate goal is ultra-fast and motion-robust imaging in a dedicated child-friendly environment to enable more children undergo MRI without anesthesia. For those who still require anesthesia, it will be briefer and lighter, and performed in a safer environment. This project leverages a small compact magnet, designed for adult brain MRI, with gradients that enable very fast imaging. With this magnet as an outstanding starting point, we will tailor our deep experience and multiple successes in developing new MRI approaches to high-density receiver coils, fast imaging sequences, and new image reconstruction methods to set a new standard for pediatric MRI. Approach: Although the compact scanner is designed for adult heads, with a 37 cm inner diameter, it can accommodate children under eight to ten years of age to image any body part. To transform this system for ideal pediatric scanning, three development aims will be pursued. The ﬁrst is to enable optimal signal reception. This will be accomplished through creating new receive chain electronics that are matched to the gradient capabilities, for ultra-high bandwidth imaging. This will be coupled to very thin and formed receive arrays that maximize the size of the patient that can be accommodated in the small bore of the scanner. The second aim is to develop methods of obtaining the highest performance out of the system by characterizing and correcting for its imperfections. This will be coupled to a bespoke approach to peripheral nerve stimulation, enabling maximal use of the gradients on each patient. These two developments will then be leveraged for high efﬁciency and motion robust noncartesian scanning. The ﬁnal aim is to develop a full environment and infrastructure that is well suited to pediatric imaging. Patient preparation and acclimation to MRI will be enhanced by virtual reality. Support equipment for anesthesia, new physiological sensors, and a novel child-friendly audiovisual system will be created. Signiﬁcance: The result of this project will be a revolutionary change in the way that MRI is used and per- formed for children. MRI will be more available, cheaper, safer, and have markedly improved image quality. Project Narrative We will leverage the outstanding magnet and gradients of a unique small bore MRI scanner to create a new standard for unprecedented whole-body pediatric MR imaging. We will develop, integrate, and validate a set of technologies speciﬁcally for pediatric imaging. These include ultra-high bandwidth MRI signal reception from thin form-ﬁtting hardware, high-speed image data acquisition and image reconstruction, and environmental support appropriate for children.",Enabling the Next Generation of High Performance Pediatric Whole Body MR Imaging,9944392,U01EB029427,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Acclimatization', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cone', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Flare', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Infrastructure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Nerve Stimulation', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Support System', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Vendor', 'base', 'commercialization', 'contrast imaging', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pediatric patients', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'whole body imaging']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,887058,0.030747031481314337
"A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain Project Summary  In this project, we propose to validate and characterize ﬁber orientation estimation from diffusion tensor imag- ing (DTI) through the optimization of a multi-modality, multi-scale imaging pipeline for whole mouse brains. DTI is a powerful tool used to noninvasively report 3D microstructural properties of nervous tissue on a macroscopic scale, and has played an important role in the understanding and diagnosis of a number of neurological disease processes. Modern acquisitions of DTI data can be processed to generate a 3D diffusion proﬁle known as an orientation diffusion function (ODF) at each voxel. The ODF is used to infer the orientation of local axon ﬁber pop- ulations. Previous efforts to validate these orientation estimates have primarily relied on serial optical histology as a ground truth dataset. Histology-based pipelines involve the labor intensive task of physically sectioning the tissue into thin slices, leading to physical destruction of the sample and anisotropic resolution. These limitations potentially confound the accuracy of 3D orientation estimation, complicate the process of spatially registering the ground-truth and DTI datasets, and limit quantitative comparisons to select regions of interest (ROI) across the brain sample.  In recent years, synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) has emerged as a powerful tool for high-resolution tissue imaging. With a mosaic projection-stitching method, a whole mouse brain can be imaged at an isotropic, 3D resolution of 1.2 microns after prior imaging with DTI. To enhance microCT contrast, the tis- sue specimens are ﬁxed and stained with the same kind of metal-based stains used in electron microscopy (EM) prior to embedding in resin. We will optimize this microCT-EM validation pipeline to address the limitations of pre- vious histology-based studies, and characterize DTI algorithm performance across a whole mouse brain using micron- to nano-scale neurological information.  The speciﬁc aims of the proposal are: (1) model phase contrast to optimize microCT data acquisition, (2) vali- date DTI ODF reconstruction methods using ground-truth microCT (3) characterize DTI performance using under- lying tissue microstructure information from EM. Upon completion, aim 1 will generate a novel theoretical model and acquisition strategy to exploit microCT phase contrast in strongly absorbing biological samples. Aim 2 will generate a ground-truth dataset of ODFs across a whole mouse brain, which will be used to calculate algorithm- speciﬁc spatial maps of DTI performance. In Aim 3, around 20 ROI will be selected for nano-scale imaging with EM, and DTI performance will be characterized by quantitative features of the underlying neural architecture. These results will provide an unprecedented microstructure-driven understanding of the DTI signal, allowing fu- ture studies to develop more advanced DTI models and acquisition strategies to better leverage ﬁber orientation and connectivity information in the treatment of neurological disease. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to use synchrotron x-ray microcomputed tomography and serial electron microscopy to validate diffusion MRI reconstruction methods. This unprecedented pipeline allows for imaging the same tissue across scales ranging from hundreds of microns to tens of nanometers. The high resolution modalities will provide insight into the true neurological microstructure driving the diffusion MRI signal, leading to better modeling and increased clinical and research utility.","A novel multi-modal, multi-scale imaging pipeline for the validation of diffusion MRI of the brain",9987313,F31NS113571,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mus', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurologic', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plant Resins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'electron tomography', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'insight', 'interest', 'microCT', 'multimodality', 'nanometer', 'nanoscale', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'physical process', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'tractography', 'validation studies']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2020,40827,0.018132307311814526
"Harmonization of Multi-Site Neuroimaging Data from Complex Study Designs PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past decade, the number of large multi-center neuroimaging studies has skyrocketed due to growing investments by federal governments and private entities interested in brain development, aging, and pathology. This has led to the accumulation of vast amounts of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data which have been acquired with varying amounts of technical harmonization. Such efforts, which have focused on protocol harmonization and comparisons with imaging phantoms, have shown great strides toward reducing inter- scanner differences in imaging features extracted for further study. Unfortunately, MRI show inter-instrument biases even in the most carefully controlled studies. Our group, among many others, has shown that these differences often dwarf biological differences of interest measured using both structural and functional MRI.  To address this, the field has rapidly been developing tools for the harmonization of imaging data after acquisition. We have proposed several such tools, and our work has often focused on the adaptation of methods used in genomic studies for batch effect correction. Our most recent such work involved the ComBat method, which uses empirical Bayesian estimation to correct for site effects in both means and variances of imaging features under study. To date, these tools have been successfully applied in studies of cortical thickness, white matter microstructure, and functional connectivity. However, there are unfortunately several key limitations to the ComBat method for imaging studies that stem from its original conception for gene expression studies.  ComBat was designed for the study of inter-scanner differences in cross-sectionally acquired data. While cross-sectional studies are of great interest and exceedingly common, much focus in the context of healthy brain development and aging has shifted to measuring longitudinal trajectories. In such cases, the naïve application of ComBat is flawed and methodological research is necessary for appropriate harmonization tools to be developed. Furthermore, more complex nested study design in which multiple scanners are used per institution, or a subset of subjects are imaged on multiple scanners for harmonization purposes, are increasingly common. Another key area of interest in modern neuroimaging studies is to focus on inter-region structural or functional connectivity and uses multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to improve our understanding of phenotypic associations as well as for personalized predictions. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art in image harmonization ignores correlation structure between measurements, and thus inter- scanner differences often persist.  In this project, we propose a new generation of techniques that are applicable under complex study designs and harmonize appropriately for studies involving applications of MVPA. In our final aim of this proposal, we will apply the methods developed for more complex study designs and MVPA in the context of two of the largest NIH-funded multi-center consortia across the lifespan. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past decade, the number of large multi-center neuroimaging studies has skyrocketed due to growing investments by federal governments and private entities interested in brain development, aging, and pathology. This has led to the accumulation of vast amounts of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired using various study designs, but the statistical methodology necessary for harmonizing these data for integrated analyses is currently lacking. In this project, we propose to develop, implement, and apply next-generation imaging harmonization methods for data acquired longitudinally or from more complex study designs, as well as appropriate harmonization methods for use in conjunction with popular multivariate pattern analysis techniques.",Harmonization of Multi-Site Neuroimaging Data from Complex Study Designs,10028642,R01MH123550,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Advocate', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conceptions', 'Controlled Study', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dwarfism', 'Federal Government', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investments', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'cognitive development', 'combat', 'complex data ', 'data harmonization', 'design', 'gray matter', 'healthy aging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'stem', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,602030,0.0008470035039448116
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,9927622,R01EB009690,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'data quality', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient tolerability', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,664041,0.020935329441825325
"In vivo dual-axis confocal microscopy of 5-ALA-induced PpIX to guide low-grade glioma resections Summary Extent-of-resection is correlated with glioma patient outcomes such as progression-free survival. Image- guidance technologies, based on MRI and now fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS), have been developed to improve the surgeon’s ability to visualize gross tumor margins. However, there are fundamental limitations to wide-field imaging methods such as MRI and FGS, such as poor sensitivity to detect disseminated tumor cells at the infiltrative margins of diffuse gliomas, as well as the non-quantitative and subjective nature of image interpretation. With the emergence of FGS using 5-ALA, and its recent approval by the FDA in 2017, the gap between low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG) patients, in terms of extent of resection, will likely widen since LGGs rarely generate sufficient PpIX fluorescence to be detected via wide-field FGS. Consequently, there is a clear need for improved intraoperative techniques with the sensitivity to detect and quantify residual LGGs at the margins of the tumor cavity in order to improve the extent of resection and delay recurrence. We have shown that high-resolution confocal microscopy has the sensitivity to visualize the sparse sub-cellular expression of PpIX in LGG patients treated with 5-ALA, even beyond the radiographic margins. Therefore, we will optimize a handheld optical-sectioning microscope to image 5-ALA-induced PpIX at the final resection margins in LGG patients, together with real-time video mosaicking to facilitate the imaging of large tissue areas, which will minimize sampling bias when imaging heterogeneous brain tissues (Aim 1). In order to facilitate the clinical acceptance of these techniques, we will establish a relationship between the microscopic patterns of PpIX expression and well-established biological metrics such as tumor burden and proliferative index (Aim 2). Finally, we will explore the hypothesis that quantitative microscopic imaging of PpIX of the resection margins is predictive of extent of resection, as currently defined by post-operative MRI, which would suggest that it has value for optimizing resections to minimize and/or delay recurrence (Aim 3). Collectively, these results will pave the way for future randomized controlled clinical studies to optimize resection procedures and outcomes for LGG patients (adults and children), many of whom can have good survival outcomes and quality of life. Relevance to public health We are developing a set of technologies to enable real-time intraoperative microscopy of the final resection margins of low-grade glioma (LGG) patients who have been administered with 5-ALA prior to surgery (FDA approved in 2017). These quantitative and sensitive imaging techniques have the potential to improve the extent of resection for LGG patients, and therefore to improve patient outcomes such as overall survival and progression-free survival (time to recurrence).",In vivo dual-axis confocal microscopy of 5-ALA-induced PpIX to guide low-grade glioma resections,9859167,R01CA244170,"['Adult', 'Aminolevulinic Acid', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biophotonics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Glioma', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Institutes', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronavigation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proliferation Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sterility', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Burden', 'Validation', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'fluorescence-guided surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'lens', 'microscopic imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'overexpression', 'prototype', 'survival outcome', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,607334,0.03383435228037615
"Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture. In the U.S. today, 10 million individuals are estimated to already have the disease and almost 34 million more are estimated to have low bone density, placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis and broken bones. Currently, determination of fracture risk, aging effects, and therapeutic efficacy is primarily based on bone mineral density (BMD) measured by areal or volumetric X-ray-based imaging techniques. BMD can predict bone strength and fracture risk to some extent, however, studies have shown that BMD only explains about 70%-75% of the variance in strength, while the remaining variance has been attributed to the cumulative and synergistic effect of other factors such as bone structure, topology, geometry, tissue composition, microdamage, and biomechanical factors. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a noninvasive in-vivo imaging technique which depicts many of these features, including density, geometry, structure, topology, and mechanics of cortical and trabecular bone in the distal radius and distal tibia. To date HR-pQCT imagery has been analyzed using conventional quantitative approaches that average bone features over large regions of interest. The individual quantification of average bone features (uni-parametric) or their statistical combination (multi-parametric) disregard how these three-dimensional (3D) features synergistically contribute to bone strength. As a result the traditional methods fail to capture the spatial patterning of the effect being studied, which is key to understanding the underlying biology. Bone is a 3D organ experiencing constant adaptation through remodeling, and should therefore be analyzed with 3D techniques that reflect the complementary and interdependent nature of different bone features. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is a technique that enables 3D spatial comparisons of multi-parametric maps between groups of subjects. Instead of measuring summary properties for arbitrary or subjective volumes of interest, this data-driven process identifies regions significantly associated with a variable of interest through valid statistical tests, thus generating 3D statistical and P-value maps that facilitate the visualization and consequently the interpretation of comparisons between target populations. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish a framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. For this purpose, specialized SPM techniques have been developed for HR-pQCT. To evaluate the potential of SPM in clinical science, we propose to apply SPM to image data from three existing in-vivo HR-pQCT studies investigating: a) regional variations in bone structure related to gender and age; b) differences due to fracture of the forearm; and c) longitudinal effects of two osteoporosis treatments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a population-based framework to automatically identify relevant bone sub-regions and features in specific populations for the targeted quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and prediction of bone strength using HR-pQCT. To demonstrate the potential of this framework in clinical science, we apply it to existing HR-pQCT studies to identify bone sub-regions and features significantly associated with age, gender, fracture status and response to osteoporosis treatment in post menopausal women; identify spatial associations between the central and distal skeleton with respect to treatment response; and improve fracture discrimination, and the prediction and understanding of the effects of osteoporosis treatment. This framework could improve the development of innovative, more active and safer drugs and therapies, and directly benefit patients suffering osteoporosis and other bone disorders since based on HR-pQCT maps of parameters estimating bone density and quality, a treatment offering the most clinical benefits to them could be prescribed.            ",Multi-Parametric Spatial Assessment of Bone with HR-pQCT,9911975,R01AR068456,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases', 'Bone structure', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exercise', 'Forearm Fracture', 'Fracture', 'Gender', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hip region structure', 'Hormonal', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Distribution', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Osteoporosis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Skeleton', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'age effect', 'base', 'bone', 'bone quality', 'bone strength', 'cortical bone', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'fracture risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'patient response', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skeletal', 'skeletal disorder', 'spatial relationship', 'substantia spongiosa', 'tibia', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,276227,0.01821495207873368
"Permeability Imaging using Simultaneous Dynamic PET and Arterial Spin Labeling MRI Abstract Candidate's Career Goals: Dr. Han has a strong background in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, image reconstruction and arterial spin labeling (ASL), with a Ph.D. in bio and brain engineering. Dr. Han is currently at a junior-faculty rank of instructor at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). His goal is to expand his future career to multi-modality positron emission tomography (PET)-MR imaging for translational research and clinical improvement. His long-term goal is to become an independent, accomplished investigator that can lead future scientific and clinical imaging projects taking full advantage of multi-modality PET-MR imaging. Career Development Plan: Foundational training in PET/PET-MR imaging as well as neurology is proposed for the candidate, an area that the candidate currently lacks knowledge and experience in. The candidate plans to engage in formal course work/seminars, research via one-on-one instructions with mentors and collaborators, conferences/presentations, manuscript/grant preparations, and teaching/leadership roles to grow as an independent investigator in the field of PET-MR imaging and neurology. Research Project: The overall goal of the proposed research is to take advantage of simultaneous dynamic PET and ASL-MR imaging to estimate the permeability surface product (PS) of the PET tracer, which is new physiological information that cannot be obtained with PET or MR alone. PS describes the unidirectional flux rate of macromolecules from the blood plasma into the interstitial space of cellular tissue and is the key metric for assessing the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Knowing the PS of the PET tracer provides powerful capability to probe the physiological delivery process of essential macromolecules involved in the pathogenesis of diseases in relation to BBB, due to the theoretically unlimiting potential in the design of radioactive analogs of important biological compounds. We plan to develop a PET tracer PS mapping method, achieve the first phantom and human study with PS mapping, and study the changes in the spatial distribution of tau neurofibrillary tangles (tau) and amyloid-beta (Aß) plaque depositions in relation to the BBB integrity changes with pathological events associated with the progression of AD, by performing dynamic-PET/mPLD-ASL studies using 18F-T807 and 11C- Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET tracers on AD and normal subjects. Environment: MGH provides an ideal setting for conducting research in MR, PET, and PET-MR imaging since multiple state-of-the-art imaging systems are available for preclinical/clinical MR scanners and preclinical simultaneous PET-MR scanners. There is a dynamic flow phantom designed to simulate blood flow for two compartment pharmacokinetics and an MR-compatible pump and detection system for continuous blood sampling suitable for performing ASL flow and PET imaging studies with arterial sampling. Also, there is a shared memory supercomputer ideal for the image reconstruction proposed in the project. MGH is also home to many experts in both PET-MR imaging and neurology who can provide their expertise to this project.
